Service:

Please see the initial dictation that went through from
[**9-9**] to [**9-25**].  This discharge addendum is from
[**9-25**] to [**10-1**].

REMAINDER OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was scheduled to
have a CT scan to investigate her rising white count.
Because of her difficulty swallowing, a nasogastric tube was
planned to be placed.  We tried placing the tube initially to
cause the patient a lot of discomfort, and after the first
attempt, the patient refused any further attempts.

The CT scan was cancelled and after attempting multiple more
times to discuss with the patient her desire for any kind of
invasive feeding devices including nasogastric tube or
Dobhoff tube, PEG tube, as well as discussing with her
health-care proxy with her daughter and her prior understood
wishes for no artificial means of nutrition.  Her TPN was
continued for four more days while these ongoing sessions
were going on as well as we were continuing to hospital
course.

After multiple long discussions with the daughter as well as
multiple attempts to try to speak with the patient about all
of these issues, it was decided to discontinue TPN, not
pursue any kind of invasive feeding tube, and to allow the
patient to eat what she is able to tolerate by mouth with the
understanding that this may not provide adequate nutritional
support, and also in light of the patient's difficulties with
swallowing.

The patient remains stable throughout the remainder of her
course.  Her medications were changed back to po medication
and she is to be discharged today to a nursing home to take
her po medications as tolerated and nutrition by mouth.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Fair.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to her nursing home.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lasix 40 mg po q day, levothyroxine
112 mcg po q day, citalopram 20 mg po q day, digoxin 0.125 mg
po q day, lisinopril 10 mg po q day, metoprolol 25 mg po bid,
Lovenox 60 mg subQ q24h, and nitroglycerin ointment of 2% q6h
prn.
