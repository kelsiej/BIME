Admission Date:  [**3298-1-8**]       Discharge Date:  [**3298-2-8**]

Date of Birth:   [**3216-9-9**]       Sex:  F

Service:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81-year-old
female who was transferred from an outside hospital after
being treated for flash pulmonary edema and a subsequent
myocardial infarction.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (The patient has a past medical
history of)
1.  Protein S deficiency with recurrent deep venous
thrombosis and pulmonary emboli (she is on chronic Coumadin).
2.  She has had cardiac stenting performed.
3.  She has schizophrenia.
4.  Chronic renal insufficiency.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Her home medications included
prednisone (for her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease),
Coumadin, nitroglycerin patch, Aricept, Aldactone, Bactrim,
metoprolol, Neurontin, Lasix, Flovent, Zyprexa, and
Pravachol.

ALLERGIES:

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed the patient was afebrile.  Vital signs were stable.
The neck veins were distended.  There were bibasilar rales.
There was a [**3-28**] holosystolic murmur at the base of the heart.
The abdomen was nontender.  The extremities were without
edema.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted
to the Coronary Care Unit where she was treated medically for
her myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure.  She
was also treated empirically with antibiotics (for a question
of pneumonia) and with stress-dose steroids.

While in house, early in her stay, the patient experienced
bright red blood per rectum for which she was treated with
vitamin K and underwent a colonoscopy which showed internal
hemorrhoids and diverticulosis in the sigmoid and descending
colon; otherwise a normal study.

Also while in house, the patient underwent an echocardiogram
which showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 25% and
severe aortic stenosis.  A coronary artery angiogram was also
performed which showed 2-vessel coronary artery disease,
severe aortic stenosis, as well as severe systolic and
diastolic ventricular dysfunction.

After being optimized medically, the patient was taken to the
operating room on [**3298-1-21**] where an aortic
replacement and coronary artery bypass graft were performed
using a mechanical valve and the left internal mammary artery
to the left anterior descending artery.

Postoperatively, the patient did well.  She was initially
weaned from all pressors and extubated.  Her chest tubes were
removed.  She was kept on heparin early on as she did have a
protein S deficiency and there was concern that she could
have complications of emboli.  However, the patient did have
recurring problems in which she would have bronchospastic
attacks requiring reintubation.

Interventional Pulmonology was consulted and determined that
the patient suffered from tracheomalacia.  For this reason,
and due to failure of resolution of the problem, the patient
underwent stenting of her trachea.  Once performed, the
patient was restarted on Coumadin and spent the rest of her
days in the Intensive Care Unit being cared for with close
respiratory care; including nebulizer treatment such a
physical therapy and close monitoring in bringing up her
secretions.

Also while in house, the patient did test positive for
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which
was treated with vancomycin.  She also tested positive for
gram-negative rods in her urine.  Therefore, she was treated
with Levaquin for a urinary tract infection.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was in good condition on
[**3298-2-8**].

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:   The patient was to be transferred to
an acute care facility which will be able to give close
respiratory care and attention.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient will require q.6h. nebulizer as well as q.6h.
chest physical therapy.
2.  She will require her INR to be checked in order to best
monitor her Coumadin dosing.  She has a goal INR of 2 to 2.5.
3.  The patient has a baseline creatinine of approximately
1.6 to 1.7 and will also need her urine status closely
monitored.
4.  The patient may not drive for one week.  She may not lift
more than 10 pounds for three months.
5.  She may shower but not take bathes.
6.  The patient was instructed to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
in one to two weeks.
7.  The patient was instructed to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
two to three weeks.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      81 year old woman with CABG/AVR                                                 
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      r/o external compression of left bronchus                                       
     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     CHEST CT:
     
     INDICATION:  81 year old woman recently s/p CABG and AVR.  Persistent left
     lower lobe atelectasis.  Assess for external compression of the left bronchus.
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained through
     the chest following the administration of 100 cc Optiray contrast IV.  Optiray
     contrast was utilized secondary to patient debility.
     
     COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest x-rays.  There are no prior chest CT's for
     comparison.
     
     FINDINGS:  Evaluation of the lung windows reveals a small left-sided
     hydropneumothorax.  There is a small left pleural effusion which appears
     partially loculated.  There is a left-sided chest tube in place directed
     towards the left apex.  At the base of the lung, the chest tube appears to
     traverse across pulmonary parenchyma.  Soft tissue density material occupies
     the majority of the chest tube along its inferior course through the chest.
     There are tiny pockets of subcutaneous emphysema at the site of entry along
     the left lateral chest wall.  There is dense consolidation of the left lower
     lobe posteriorly with air bronchograms.  There are two small pockets of fluid
     density material abutting this consolidation, probably reflecting loculated
     pleural fluid.  There is atelectasis of the lingula.
     
     Evaluation of the airways reveals severe tracheomalacia of the extrathoracic
     trachea.  At its narrowest, the trachea measures just 2 mm in its maximum AP
     diameter.  At the level of the carina, there is layering soft tissue density
     material within the trachea which extends into both right and left main
     bronchi.  The left main bronchus is nearly completely occupied with soft
     tissue density material.  This likely reflects secretions or mucous plugging.
     There is no evidence of external compression of the left main bronchus.
     
     Soft tissue windows demonstrate multiple bulky mediastinal lymph nodes, the
     largest of which is located in the prevascular location and measures 15 X 21
     mm in size.  The patient is s/p median sternotomy and there is mild soft
     tissue density in the anterior mediastinum.  This is most likely post surgical
     in nature.  There is a small amount of loculated pericardial fluid seen. There
     is calcification along the apex of the left ventricle, probably reflecting the
     site of prior infarction.
     
     Images through the upper abdomen reveal no significant focal abnormalities of
                                                                 (Over)

     the visualized portions of the liver, adrenal glands, pancreas or spleen.
     
     Bone windows reveal mild degenerative changes of the osseous structures.  The
     patient is s/p recent median sternotomy.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Small left-sided hydropneumothorax in the setting of a left-sided chest
     tube.  This chest tube appears to course through a segment of left lower lobe
     parenchyma and the tube itself is largely occupied with soft tissue density
     material.
     2)  Dense left lower lobe consolidation with air bronchograms and associated
     small fluid collections which likely reflect loculated pleural fluid.
     3)  Severe tracheomalacia of the extrathoracic trachea.  Soft tissue density
     is present to a mild extent in the right main bronchus and nearly completely
     occupies the left main bronchus.  This appearance most likely reflects
     secretions or mucous impaction.  No external compression of the left main
     bronchus is identified.
     4)  Calcification at the apex of the left ventricle, probably related to prior
     infarct.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
       81 year old woman s/p recetn CABG/AVR p/w respiratory failure s/p intubation, 
      had central line placement complicated by right carotic cannulation and 
      pneumothorax.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Please evaluate pneumothorax and if feasible place pigtail.Also please CT neck 
      angio the Left Carotid s/p low puncture for evidence of dissection and 
      extravasation.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  An 81-year-old woman with respiratory failure, intubated, with
     central line placement complicated by left carotid cannulation and
     pneumothorax.  Evaluate for carotid dissection and extravasation.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiple axial images of the neck were obtained following the
     administration of 100 cc of Optiray.
     
     CT NECK WITH CONTRAST:  There is no active extravasation of contrast
     identified.  The left jugular vein is identified, however, the left subclavian
     vein is not seen and this could be technical.  The left carotid artery is well
     visualized, without dissection or active extravasation.
     
     The partially-visualized lungs show a small left-sided pneumothorax.  The
     partially-visualized sinuses show fluid in the maxillary and sphenoid sinuses,
     which could be related to the patient's intubation.  The thyroid gland appears
     enlarged and is irregular, and an ultrasound is recommended for further
     evaluation of this finding.
     
     There are numerous enlarged prevascular lymph nodes seen in the few images of
     the upper chest.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Small left-sided pneumothorax.  No carotid dissection or active
     extravasation is seen.

7a-11a
Resp:  Pt was placed on PSV 5/Peep 5 and tolerated it for 45 min with no resp discomfort.  She was extubated at 9am but desaturated W/I 2 minutes.  She sounded wheezey and stridorous. She was encouraged to C&DB with little improvement.  Her O2 sats dropped to the low 80's so was bagged to improve her sats.  She was then placed on Bipap 10/8 and she improved, however she dropped her pressure (see below).  She pulled off the bipap around 10a but she started to drop her sats immediately so she was put back on with settings [**12-31**].  Her sats have been 94-96% with RR 22-25.

Cardiac:  Following extubation and within 1/2 hour of being placed on the Bipap she dropped her B/P to the low 80's/, HR 50-60. She was bolused with 500cc NS with no effect on her B/P so she was started on dopa at 5mcg/kg/min.  Her B/P increased to 100/ in the first 5min but her B/P kept increasing so after 10min the dopa was weaned to 2.5mcg/kg/min for a B/P 147/50's, then turned off.  She was on the dopa for ~20min.  Her B/P kept going up to 180-190/, 90-100, and she had crackles in her bases so she was given Lasix 40mg IVP, to which she diuresed 500cc in the first hour.  She was also given 1mg versed for anxiety and her B/P stablized at 140's/50's, HR 80's.

Neuro:  Pt was awake and alert with propofol infusing at 17.5mcg/kg/min, and turned to 15mcg with extubation.  When she dropped her B/P the propofol was D/C'ed.  She became unresponsive with her hypotension but agitated with her B/P high so she was given 1mg versed with a big decreased in anxiety.  She is now calmer and cooperative.

GI:  Tube feedings stopped at 8:30 for extubation and the NGT was D/C'ed wtih the ETT.  She had a large golden loose stool at 9a.

GU:  foley draining clear yellow urine 40cc/hr.  She then had a great response to lasix.

Skin:  Myconacole powder applied to yeast rash on her buttock area.

Plan:  Monitor resp status, keep on bipap until comfortable.  Monitor I&O and cardiac status.
