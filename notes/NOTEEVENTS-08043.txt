History of Present Illness:
62y/o M found down in field with v fib-->arrest after completing 
a 2 mile bike ride. Down for approx. 5 min before CPR and 10 min 
before EMS arrival, shocked for VFib x 4, intubated, given epi, 
lidocaine, atropine and -> to OSH. In OSH, was in/out of VT, 
shocked x 6, and started on amiodarone, stabilising in probable 
junctional rhythm. CT showed occipital hematoma from fall with 
likely contracoup left frontal subdural hematoma and contusion, 
also small subarachnoid.

REPORT APPROVED DATE:[**2536-7-18**] 
TEST DATE: [**2536-7-17**] 
INTERPRETED BY: [**Last Name (LF) 3808**],[**First Name3 (LF) **] L.

FINDINGS: 
ABNORMALITY#1: The background rhythm is low voltage. At 2 
microvolt
amplification [**Hospital1 **]-frontal beta activity is visible and there is
intermittent theta frequency activity with a 1 Hz delta 
frequency
background rhythm. This delta frequency slowing appears 
synchronous with
the cardiac monitor and may reflect a pulse artifact.
BACKGROUND: As above.
HYPERVENTILATION: Was not performed due to the patient's 
clinical
condition.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Was not performed since this 
was a
portable study.
[**Doctor Last Name **]: Normal [**Doctor Last Name 314**] architecture was not seen.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Sinus tachycardia with a rate of 108 beats per 
minute.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the low 
voltage
background activity. [**Hospital1 **]-frontal beta activity is present as is
intermittent theta frequency slowing of the background rhythm. A 
delta
frequency background rhythm is also present and may reflect a 
pulsation
artifact. Painful stimulation during the recording did not alter 
the
background rhythm. These findings suggest a severe 
encephalopathy and
could be consistent with hypoxic injury from cardiac arrest but
medication effects are also possible. No epileptiform activity 
was seen.
A narrow complex tachycardia was noted on the cardiac monitor.
OBJECT: 62 year old man with a history of recent cardiac arrest.
Evaluate for seizures.
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 83**] from an OSH. He was 
cardiovascularly supported in the CCU, with the hope that the 
neurological sequelae of his vfib arrest might resolve. However, 
CT imaging determined that extensive severe anoxic brain injury 
had occurred. In conjunction with the patient's poor clinical 
presentation on neurological exam, this indicated a very poor 
prognosis. The patient was placed on comfort measures on [**2536-7-19**] 
and extubated. The patient's cardiovascular status began to 
deteriorate. Pt. died at 3.33pm.

     INDICATION: Intubated patient after cardiopulmonary arrest.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Single portable AP view of the chest was obtained without
     comparison.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is an ET tube in place, with the tip approximately 4 cm above
     the carina.  NG tube is also seen, extending through the stomach beyond the
     inferior border of the film.  The cardiac silhouette is probably within normal
     limits given the portable AP technique. The entire lateral portion of the
     right hemithorax has been coned off from view.  No evidence of pneumothorax or
     definite pleural effusions.
     
     IMPRESSION: Appropriate  positioning of ET tube.  No significant abnormalities
     in the visualized portions of the lungs.

     Evaluation for fracture requested.
     
     COMPARISONS:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial non-contrast CT images of the cervical spine were obtained,
     and sagittal and coronal reconstructions were performed.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is overall normal alignment of the cervical spine with no
     subluxations.  There are calcifications, and possibly ossifications, of the
     anterior longitudinal ligament at multiple levels consistent with degenerative
     changes.  There is no significant disc, vertebral, or paraspinal abnormality
     seen.  There is a possible small fracture on the distal upper spinous process
     of the T1 vertebra.  However, the observed separate bony fragment may
     represent unfused ossification.  Clinical correlation is suggested- is there
     point tenderness at this locale? There is no other sign of fracture of the
     component vertebrae. Although CT is not able to provide intrathecal detail,
     the spinal cord appears normal in the visualized portion in the upper cervical
     spine. There is an endotracheal tube passing through the airway and a
     nasogastric tube passing through the esophagus.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Question of small fracture of the distal supraspinous process of
     T1, which may also represent an unfused ossification center.  Clinical
     correlation is advised.

     INDICATION:  62-year-old man S/P fall with subdural hematoma.  
     
     COMPARISONS:  None available at this time.  We spoke with the intensive care
     team, which will try to provide the previous films.  However, the patient was
     transferred from an outside hospital, where he was found to have a subdural
     hematoma on imaging.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  Over the left parietal area, there is prominent scalp soft tissue
     swelling.  Over the right frontal convexity, there is a thin subdural hematoma
     with dense blood products of likely recent origin.  Also, there is evidence of
     subarachnoid hemorrhage in the sulci of the anterior right frontal lobe and
     laterally in the right posterior frontal lobe.  There is no hydrocephalus,
     mass effect, or shift of the normally mid-line structures.  The ventricles,
     cisterns, and sulci are unremarkable.  There is no effacement of the sulci.
     There is no evidence of major vascular territorial infarction.  There is no
     definite evidence of fracture.  There is mucosal thickening in the left
     maxillary sinus, left sphenoid sinus and central ethmoid air cells.  The
     patient is intubated.  The mastoid air cells appeared normally aerated.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Subdural hematoma along the right frontal convexity with
     adjacent subarachnoid hemorrhages, but no significant mass effect.
     2)  Soft tissue swelling over the left posterior calvarium.
     3)  No definite evidence of fracture.  Once available, we will review the
     previous study.

     INDICATIONS: A 62-year-old man with subdural and subarachnoid hematoma and
     left frontal lobe contusion.   Question of whether subdural and subarachnoid
     hematomas are improving or worsening.  Please evaluate left frontal lobe
     contusion. Additional history is that the patient had a prolonged cardiac
     arrest.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Non-contrast head CT of [**2536-7-16**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  There has been redistribution of the hemorrhage products, but no
     evidence of new hemorrhage.  There is intraventricular hemorrhage layering in
     both occipital horns.  However, there is no hydrocephalus, mass effect, or
     shift of the normally midline structures.  There is subtle effacement of the
     sulci bilaterally and posteriorly with a possible loss of [**Doctor Last Name 30**]-white matter
     distinction.  However, there is no evidence of major vascular territorial
     infarction.  The patient is intubated, and there is fairly unchanged mucosal
     thickening in the paranasal sinuses.

     1) Some redistribution of the known subarachnoid hemorrhage with
     intraventricular hemorrhage seen in the occipital horns bilaterally, but no

     2) Subtle effacement of the posterior sulci of the cerebral hemispheres with

     INDICATION:  Evaluate endotracheal tube placement.
     
     An endotracheal tube and left subclavian vascular catheter remain in
     satisfactory position.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
     Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits for technique.  There are patchy
     and linear opacities in the retrocardiac region bilaterally which appears
     slightly improved since the recent study.  The remainder of the lungs appear
     clear, but the periphery of the right mid and lower lung zone have been
     excluded from the stomach and cannot be fully assessed.  There is no evidence
     of pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Slight improvement in retrocardiac opacities likely due to
     atelectasis.  Resolving aspiration is within the differential diagnosis.
