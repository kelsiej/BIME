Admission Date:  [**2501-11-22**]       Discharge Date:  [**2501-12-5**]

Date of Birth:   [**2429-6-6**]       Sex:  M

Service:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This was a 71-year-old male who
was struck by a car and found to have a GCS of 5 on the scene
and was intubated by EMS.  He was initially hypertensive and
tachycardiac and was then flighted to [**Hospital6 2460**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Right hip repair.

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN, PERCOCET.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  None.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  He was intubated and
tachycardiac at 110, and hypertensive at 174/100.  His GCS
was 6T.  HEENT:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light;
however, he did have blood in his left tympanic membrane.
The rest of his exam showed deformities of the right tibia,
as well as scalp laceration, as well as an elbow laceration.

LABORATORY DATA:  Within normal limits.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Trauma
Service and ultimately required a craniotomy for a subdural
hematoma.  He also ended requiring a washout of his left open
tibia-fibular fracture and was transferred to the Intensive
Care Unit.

He had a prolonged Intensive Care Unit stay including
multiple antibiotics for infection, prolonged ventilation,
and ventriculostomy drain for control of his subdural
hematoma.

An IVC filter was also placed postoperative for prophylaxis
against deep venous thrombosis.  Due to his bleed, he was
unable to receive Heparin.

The patient continued to have significant hemodynamic
instability and was unable to wean off of his ventilator
during his hospital course.

He was taken to the Operating Room for his tibia-fibular
repair and again was continued on multiple antibiotics for
CSF infection, as well as pneumonia.  He was given tube feeds
for nutritional support through his hospital stay, and he was
given Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.  He had elevated
fevers throughout his hospital stay.

Ultimately a family meeting was held on [**2501-12-3**], and
it was decided by the family that the patient would be DNR.
It was decided on [**2501-12-3**], after further discussion
with the family that the patient be made CMO.  On [**2501-12-4**], he was made DNR.  The vent drain was removed.  The
patient was extubated, and he was put on a Morphine and
Fentanyl drip for comfort.  The patient expired on [**2501-12-5**].

     INDICATION: Trauma. ETT, NG tube and right subclavian line placement, evaluate
     position, r/o pneumothorax.
     
     CHEST AP: The tip of the right subclavian line is at the junction of the
     subclavian and jugular veins. The tip of the NG tube is in the lower end of
     the esophagus and should be advanced. The tip of the ETT is about 5 cm above
     the carina. 2 ____ electrodes are seen. Some left ventricular enlargement and
     aortic unfolding is noted. No rib fractures are identified, however, this is
     of limited view and rib fractures cannot be ruled out. A small
     effusion/pleural thickening is noted at the right costophrenic angle. Follow
     up with PA & lateral is recommended. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac
     size is normal. The lung fields are clear.
     
     IMPRESSION: No pneumothorax.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: Open lac elbow evaluate humerus for elbow fracture.
     
     TECHNIQUE: The patient's hand is splinted in a 90 degree flexed position.
     Contiguous axial images were obtained through the elbow with this limited
     positioning and reconstructed with bone algorithm. Coronal axial
     reconstructions were generated.
     
     LOWER EXTEMIRYT CT WITHOUT CONTRAST:
     
     There is a small (4 mm) bony fragment lying along the lateral edge of the
     radial capitellar joint (series 4 image 73, series 9 53B, image 19 and series
     9 54B image 47). There is a soft tissue defect over the olecranon, extending
     to the surface of the olecranon. A tiny calcific [**Doctor Last Name 11609**] projects in the soft
     tissues over the expected course of the triceps tendon and may indicate
     avulsion of the triceps, either partial or complete. However, the main portion
     of the olecranon as well as the remainder of the proximal ulna is intact. No
     fracture lines are identified within the distal humerus or proximal radius
     including the radial head. The radial capitellar and ulnar trochlea
     articulations are congruent. No joint effusion is identified. Away from the
     area of soft tissue defect, soft tissue structures about the elbow are within
     normal limits.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Soft tissue injury over olecranon, which may involve a partial or total
     avulsion of the triceps. Clinical correlation is requested.
     
     2. Small calcific fragment along lateral border of the radial capitellar
     joint, without obvious donor site. This could represent either an ossicle or a
     subtle avulsion fracture, or less likely, a loose body within the joint or a
     foreign body introduced in this trauma. The lateral epicondyle is grossly
     unremarkable.
     
     3. Otherwise, no fracture identified about the elbow joint. See comment.

     CONTRAST:  150 cc of Optiray were administered secondary to fast rate of bolus
     injection.
     
     CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  The heart and pericardium are normal.  The anterior
     mediastinum is clear and the great vessels are intact.  There is bilateral
     atelectasis.  There is a small left upper lobe pneumatocele.  The lungs are
     clear of opacities, nodules or pneumothoraces.  There is an endotracheal tube
     and nasogastric tube present.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  In segment 4A of the liver there is a hepatic
     cyst.  The liver is normal in contour and CT attenuation without intrahepatic
     dilatation.  The spleen, pancreas and adrenals are normal.  There are
     gallstones in a non-distended gallbladder.  There is no evidence of wall
     thickening or pericholecystic fluid collections.  The pancreas is

     COMPARISON:  None
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast cervical spine CT with coronal and sagittally
     reformatted images.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of cervical spine fracture.  Multilevel
     degenerative changes including disk space narrowing and facet degenerative
     changes are noted.  There is a posterior osteophyte at the C2-3 level.
     
     An endotracheal tube and a nasogastric tube are noted.  There is extensive
     soft tissue abnormality within the right neck including subcutaneous emphysema
     which tracts superiorly into the masseter space.  There is a fracture through
     the left lateral aspect of the sphenoid bone which extends into the anterior
     aspect of the left temporal bone. There is opacification of the left middle
     ear cavity and mastoid, raising the possibility of fracture through this
     region. There is associated small amount of pneumocephalus. Additionally,
     fluid nearly fills the sphenoid sinuses bilaterally, and a small amount of
     fluid layers within each maxillary sinus, right greater than left. Very
     limited imaging of the temporal lobes demonstrates acute hemorrhage within
     both anterior temporal lobes, left greater than right.  This would be much
     better assessed by dedicated non- contrast head CT.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Left sphenoid and temporal bones fractures with associated
     trace pneumocephalus.
     2)  Fluid within the sphenoid and maxillary sinuses.  Other occult fractures
     are possible.
     3)  Subcutaneous emphysema within the right neck.
     4)  No evidence of cervical spine fracture.

     INDICATION:  Pedestrian struck by car with severe head trauma.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  NOTE:  The original dictation for this exam appears to have been
     lost and it has been resubmitted for interpretation on [**2501-11-28**]. This
     will serve as the final report.
     
     There is diffuse, bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage.  A right convexity
     subdural hematoma is noted, and a collection of blood along the left posterior
     frontal and parietal regions may represent epidural hematoma, as there is
     large associated comminuted and depressed skull fracture adjacent to this
     collection.  Additionally, there are several foci of intraparenchymal
     hemorrhage within the [**Doctor Last Name 30**] matter of the left parietal lobe.  The ventricles
     are not dilated.  There is mild mass effect from the depressed fragments of
     the left parietal bone fracture and the adjacent epidural hematoma.  Several
     bubbles of gas are seen within the epidural space on the left, as well as
     within the subarachnoid space on the left, indicating penetrating trauma.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate extent of the left parietal bone fracture into the
     left temporal and sphenoid bone.  There may be fractures through the
     tuberculum sella, adjacent to the internal carotic arteries.  Fractures of the
     medial wall of the right orbit are noted. The left zygomatic arch is
     fractured. Blood layers within the maxillary, sphenoid, ethmoid, and frontal
     sinuses bilaterally.
     
     Subcutaneous emphysema extends along the right zygomatic arch and into the
     right orbit.  Partial opacification of the left ethmoid air cells is also
     noted.  There is also slight prominence at the left superior ophthalmic
     vein, nonspecific, but which should be correlated with the possibility of a
     cavernous-carotid fistula.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Depressed left parietal bone fracture with associated epidural, subdural,
     subarachnoid, and intraparenchymal, intracranial hemorrhages.
     2)  Multiple skull based fractures, one of which may extend through the
     tuberculum sella, in close proximity to the internal carotid arteries.
     3)  Slight prominence of the left superior ophthalmic vein.

     PORTABLE CHEST:  There is an endotracheal tube in satisfactory position. There
     is a nasogastric tube present, the tip of which is not definitively seen.  The
     cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.  The mediastinal silhouette is
     somewhat prominent, most likely from portable technique.  The lungs are clear.
     There is slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle. The right
     costophrenic angle is sharp.  The visualized bones are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
     
     PORTABLE PELVIS:  There are no acute fractures.  There is a right total hip
     replacement.  There are mild degenerative changes in the left hip and
     symphysis pubis.  There are no pathologic calcifications.  There are vascular
     calcifications in the pelvis.
     
     IMPRESSION: No fracture.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      s/p multi trauma w/ head bleed, LE fracture - need IVC filter                   
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: 72-year-old man with multiple trauma, immobilization, head bleed and
     left lower extremity fracture. The patient is here for IVC filter placement.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 851**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 43**] [**Name (STitle) 44**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 43**] [**Name (STitle) 44**], the
     attending radiologist, was present and supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: As the patient was intubated and sedated, informed consent
     was obtained from the patient's wife. The procedure was explained and the
     risks and benefits were discussed with the patient's wife. The patient was
     brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the angiography table
     and his right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
     Through an anaesthetised  skin approach and using anatomical landmarks and
     fluoroscopic guidance, a 19-gauge single-wall puncture needle was used to
     access the right common femoral vein. An 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 223**] guide wire was then
     advanced through the distal inferior vena cava (IVC).
     As there was a prior CT done demonstrating a patent inferior vena cava without
     any evidence of duplication or thrombi, the decision was made to perform an
     inferior vena cavogram with the tip in the right common iliac vein. A 9-French
     sheath was then advanced over the [**Last Name (un) 223**] guide wire with the tip placed in
     the right common iliac vein. The inner dilator and the wire were removed and
     an inferior vena cavogram was performed demonstrating no evidence of any
     thrombi. There is no evidence of any duplications. The location of the renal
     veins was identified.
     This was followed by advancement of the Venatech LGM filter under fluoroscopy.
     It was deployed just inferior to the right renal vein. An IVC venogram was
     obtained following placement, documenting the tip to be in optimal position
     and absence of tilting.
     The catheter and the sheath were removed. Pressure was then applied over the
     right groin and hemostasis was achieved.
     
     ANESTHESIA/MEDICATIONS: Local anesthesia with 1% Lidocaine. 45 cc of Optiray
     320 contrast was used intravenously.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: None.
                                                                 (Over)

      72 year old man with multi trauma                                               
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      s/p multi trauma w/ head bleed, LE fracture - need IVC filter                   
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: 72-year-old man with multiple trauma, immobilization, head bleed and
     left lower extremity fracture. The patient is here for IVC filter placement.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 851**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 43**] [**Name (STitle) 44**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 43**] [**Name (STitle) 44**], the
     attending radiologist, was present and supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: As the patient was intubated and sedated, informed consent
     was obtained from the patient's wife. The procedure was explained and the
     risks and benefits were discussed with the patient's wife. The patient was
     brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the angiography table
     and his right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
     Through an anaesthetised  skin approach and using anatomical landmarks and
     fluoroscopic guidance, a 19-gauge single-wall puncture needle was used to
     access the right common femoral vein. An 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 223**] guide wire was then
     advanced through the distal inferior vena cava (IVC).
     As there was a prior CT done demonstrating a patent inferior vena cava without
     any evidence of duplication or thrombi, the decision was made to perform an
     inferior vena cavogram with the tip in the right common iliac vein. A 9-French
     sheath was then advanced over the [**Last Name (un) 223**] guide wire with the tip placed in
     the right common iliac vein. The inner dilator and the wire were removed and
     an inferior vena cavogram was performed demonstrating no evidence of any
     thrombi. There is no evidence of any duplications. The location of the renal
     veins was identified.
     This was followed by advancement of the Venatech LGM filter under fluoroscopy.
     It was deployed just inferior to the right renal vein. An IVC venogram was
     obtained following placement, documenting the tip to be in optimal position
     and absence of tilting.
     The catheter and the sheath were removed. Pressure was then applied over the
     right groin and hemostasis was achieved.
     
     ANESTHESIA/MEDICATIONS: Local anesthesia with 1% Lidocaine. 45 cc of Optiray
     320 contrast was used intravenously.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: None.
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Depressed skull fracture and skull base fracture in pedestrian
     struck by car.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast CT scans of the brain were obtained.
     
     High-resolution axial non-contrast CT scans were obtained through the skull
     base.  Coronal reformatted images are provided.
     
     Comparison is made to the previous CT scan of [**2501-11-22**].
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     CT SCAN OF THE BRAIN:
     
     The left parietal depressed skull fracture has been repaired and there is
     anatomic alignment of the fragments.  As previously noted, there is a fracture
     through the left temporal bone which extends across the floor of the middle
     cranial fossa.  There is also a left occipital bone fracture.  There is a
     nondisplaced fracture of the left zygomatic arch.  Further evaluation of the
     skull base is reported with the skull base study.
     
     There are contusions of the left parietal and occipital lobes as well as both
     temporal lobes and the right frontal lobe.  Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage
     and also small subdural hemorrhages are identified and unchanged since the
     previous study.
     
     A right frontal ventricular drainage catheter has been placed and extends
     across the body of the right lateral ventricle.  The ventricles are normal in
     size and configuration.  There is no shift of normally midline structures at
     this time.  Basal cisternal spaces are well visualized.
     
     There is evidence of blood in the paranasal sinuses.  There is right orbital
     air.
     
     Scans through the base of the skull also demonstrate a fracture across the
     left temporal bone that courses through the epitympanic cavity.  The ossicles
     appear aligned, although the resolution of this examination is limited since
     coronal images are reconstructed.  There is no clear evidence of fracture
     involving the facial nerve canal.  The semi-circular canals, vestibule and
     cochlea are intact.  The fracture line appears to extend into the osseous
     portion of the left external auditory canal, which is opacified.
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     
     Although there is opacification of the sphenoid sinus, no definite fracture
     across the sinus is identified.  The clivus is intact.  There is probably a
     fracture involving the greater [**Doctor First Name 2055**] of the sphenoid on the left.  There
     appears to be a fracture line through the posterior left maxillary sinus.  The
     anterior clinoids are intact.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Postsurgical anatomic alignment of the left parietal fracture fragments
     was achieved.  There is hemorrhage in the underlying brain.  The overall
     appearance of the brain is stable since the previous study.  The ventricles
     are not dilated.
     2.  There is fracture of the skull base, primarily involving the temporal
     bone.

     INDICATION:  Depressed skull fracture, subarachnoid hemorrhage. Status post
     evacuation.
     
     Comparison is made to prior exam [**2501-11-23**].
     
     TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast CT of the head was performed.
     
     FINDINGS:  Hemorrhage within the subarachnoid space, subdural spaces, and
     previously noted intraparenchymal foci are unchanged from previous exam.
     However, there is an increased amount of adjacent edema in the areas of
     previously noted contusion within the right frontal, left parietal and
     occipital as well as both temporal lobes.  The ventricular size is stable and
     basal cisterns are free. A right frontal drainage catheter is again seen with
     tip in body of the right lateral ventricle.  There is no shift of normally
     midline structures.  Allowing for the posiiton of the head, a similar amount
     of blood is seen within the posterior horns of the lateral ventricles.
     
     There is a stable appearance to the repair of a depressed left parietal bone
     fracture.  Fractures of the left zygoma and left temporal bone are again
     noted.  Blood and fluid within the paranasal sinuses related to the trauma and
     to intubated status is again noted.  Minimal amount of right intra orbital
     emphysema remains.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Overall similar appearance to the amount of hemorrhage seen within the
     subarachnoid and subdural spaces, as well as within areas of contusion.
     However, increased edema in areas of contusion within the temporal lobes, left
     parietal and left occipital lobe, and right frontal lobe has increased.
     2) Stable size of the ventricles with no shift of normally midline structures.

Withdraws all extremites to nailbed stimuli(LUE only faint bicep flexion noted), when lightened.  Rare spontaneous movements of R sided extremities noted.  Occasionally, when lightened, tremors over entire body seen until resedated. Dilantin load given today along with sched doses.  EVD set at 15cm above tragus.  Adequate amts of bloody drg.  ICP's [**7-12**]. Strong cough, absent gag, and impaired corneals. CT scan this am showed increased swelling per NSU resident report.  Pt grossly fluid positive today. Lasix ordered at 1800 to help with diuresis. Remains on log roll and c-spine prec. Films done yesterday--addressed with ICU and trauma residents today, still have not been cleared. 

CV---NSR with no ectopy noted.  HR 70-80's. Goal SBP <140. Initially this am, SBP markedly elevated 150-170's.  Nicardapine gtt up as high as 0.8mcg/kg/min. Sedation increased and pain meds given with good decr in BP.  Nicardapine currently at 0.2mcg/kg/min with BP 110-120's/60's.  CVP 9-15.  Extremities cool to touch. LLE with dopplerable DP pulse. LUE with palpable radial pulse.

RESP---Remained on CPAP 5/10/40% for shift.  RR 12-24, TV's 500-600. O2 sats >97%. Adequate ABG's.  Lungs coarse to bilateral upper lobes with diminished bases.  Suctioning small amts of yellow to tannish secretions.  

GI---Impact TF's via OGT--increasing to goal of 80cc/hr.  Residuals <15cc.  Abd softly distended with hypoactive BS.  Pepcid on board.

GU---Foley to gravity with cloudy yellow urine. Urine output minimal towards end of shift. 500cc bolus x1 given with scant effect seen. Lasix given at 1830 in attempts at diuresis.  K++ repleted.

ENDO---Insulin gtt with goal BS <120.  See care view for titration.

HEME---1U PRBC transfused this am for HCT of 27. HCT at 1700 28.  Heparin sub q and pneumatic boots for DVT prevention.  

ID---Tmax 98.9.  Vanco abx coverage.

Skin---Acewrap/splin dsg to L elbow intact.  Dsg to posterior head c/d/i. JP drain with small amt of sang drg.  Backside with no breakdown noted.

Social--Pt's wife and daughter in this evening. Updated on pt's condition and plan of care.

     CT BRAIN WITHOUT CONTRAST:
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT scan.
     
     FINDINGS:   Comparison with the prior study of 12/26 redemonstrates massive
     bifrontal as well as left temporal contusions.  Considerable residual
     subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage is also redemonstrated. Both
     studies show what is likely a minute acute right frontal subdural hemorrhage
     adjacent to the contusion on that side.  An equally small, more chronic-
     appearing subdural fluid collection is seen in an analogus locale on the left.
     There has been no interval change in ventricular size.  The large left
     parietal craniotomy incident to repair of the depressed skull fracture is
     redemonstrated.
     
     IMPRESSION:   Basically stable, abnormal study as note above.

Minimal flexion with upper extremities with nail bed stimulus, sometimes no movement noted, Neuro [**Doctor First Name **] aware. Bilateral LLE withdraw to nail bed stimulus. Continues on Dilantin, no seizure activity noted. Ventriculostomy at 20 cm above tragus, clamped, opened if icps <25 for 10 min. Open to drainage X 3, ICps got as high as 29, re clamped when Icps <25, see care view for details. Icps mostly ~15-20, CPP >60. +cough, +corneals, impaired gag.

CV: ST, no ectopy noted. Aret line in right radial with good wave form. BP trending 130s-160s- using PRN hydralazine and metoprolol and dilaudid to keep systolic < 160. Dp/PT pulses are present-weak to palpation bilaterally. Good cap refill noted in all extremities. Continuing on scheduled captopril and metoprolol scheduled dose increased to 150mg BID. Normal heart tones.

Pulmonary: No vent changes made, ABGs reflect adequate oxyganation, see care view for details. Lung sounds range from clear to coarse bilaterally in the upper lobes and diminished bilaterally in the bases. ETT tube retaped/repositioned. Suctioning returns small amts of tan to white thick secretions.

GI: Og tube/ TF at goal, minimal residuals, belly is softly distended, +BS, -stool, -flatus. H2B prophylaxis. 

GU:  Foley patent to gravity, adequate UOP, clear/yellow. MIVF KVO. Replenshed K+/Ca. 

ENDO: Insulin gtt, See care view for BS trends. 

ID: Tmax 101.2, to be pan Cx'd if spikes again, received tylenol PR, continues on Vanco. 

Heme: 1 unit PRBC infused, follwo up crit pending.

Social: Family in to visit, asking appropriate question, inquiring about time of family meeting on Thursday, SW involved.

Skin:  LLE open to air, staples intact/edematous, dressing removed by team slight greenish drainage noted, good cap refill. LUE dressing changed by team, some erythema noted, no drainage. Head dressing CDI, no drainage. Skin care/back care done, rash across buttocks.
