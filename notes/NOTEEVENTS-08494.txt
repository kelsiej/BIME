History of Present Illness:
64 y.o. man with hairy cell leukemia x 10 years, protate CA, 
non-small cell lung Ca in RUL presenting from [**Hospital3 **] for 
hemoptysis. Pt was admitted there on [**2-12**] for febrile 
neutropenia. On day of admission, pt noted himself to be febrile 
to 101 and he had been having increased productive cough with 
some blood tinged sputum. He also had some DOE, 8 pound wt loss 
over 2 weeks. Pt was maintained on levaquin which he was already 
on for salmonella prophylaxis. CXR showed increased opacity of 
RUL c/w PNA. Pt was treated with levaquin.  
.  
On [**2-14**], he developed hemoptysis. He was taken to the OR, 
intubated on [**2-15**]. A bronchosopy was performed which showed a 
large clot at the carina and some minor oozing but no active 
bleeding. The patient maintained good oxygenation and 
ventilation on the ventilator. A pre-bronch Hct was 26.1 (from 
28 on admit) and went to 24.3 post-bronch and 21.2 this morning. 
He received 1 U PRBC and 2 U FFP for INR of 1.4.  
.  
Patient was admitted on [**2-12**]

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course:
64 y.o. man with hairy cell leukemia x 10 years, protate CA, 
non-small cell lung Ca in RUL presenting from [**Hospital3 **] for 
hemoptysis.  He was admitted to OSH on [**2-12**] with fever and 
borderline neutropenia; he was started on levofloxacin for ? RUL 
PNA. He developed massive hemoptysis and was transferred here 
intubated. He remained febrile and neutropenic. He has undergone 
two major IR procedures to stop the bleeding from his RUL which 
is full of tumor.  There are no further interventions that IR 
can do if he bleeds more.  Thoracics has seen him in case he 
bleeds more an needs emegency surgery.
.
On day of admission to the OSH, pt noted himself to be febrile 
to 101 and he had been having increased productive cough with 
some blood tinged sputum. He also had some DOE, 8 pound wt loss 
over 2 weeks PTA.  Pt was maintained on levaquin which he was 
already on for salmonella prophylaxis.  CXR showed increased 
opacity of RUL c/w PNA. 
.  
On [**2-14**], he developed hemoptysis. He was taken to the OR, 
intubated on [**2-15**]. A bronchosopy was performed which showed a 
large clot at the carina and some minor oozing but no active 
bleeding. The patient maintained good oxygenation and 
ventilation on the ventilator. A pre-bronch Hct was 26.1 (from 
28 on admit) and went to 24.3 post-bronch and 21.2 thereafter. 
He received 1 U PRBC and 2 U FFP for INR of 1.4. 
.
In terms of his NSCLC treatment, he has undergone three cycles 
of Taxol/Carboplatin, completed ~4 weeks PTA. Treatment was 
halted [**2-26**] pancytopenia. Has also been receiving radiation 
treatment with last treatment [**2950-2-12**]. Has received about 24 
treatments (5 treatments/wk x 5 weeks). Has been taking Procrit 
for chronic anemia, and received 1U PRBC on [**2950-2-6**]. Also on 
daily SC neupogen, started in-house. 
.
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 83**] for the specific 
interventional radiology and pulmonology procedures unique to 
the institution.  Multiple attempts to control the bleeding via 
selective embolization were undertaken, and tenuous hemostasis 
was acheived.  The patient, who had been intubated for airway 
protection, was extubated without incident and suffered no 
respiratory failure.  He had arrived with fever and neutropenia 
from the OSH, and vanco/caspo/cefepime broad coverage was 
initiated.  Multiple cultures were drawn given the persistent 
fever, and all were negative in the final read.  Although the 
patient was stabilized via multiple bronchoscopies and 
interventional radiologic procedures, rebleeding remains a 
significant risk, and little could be done if another 
catastrophic bleed were to develop.
.
His persisent neutropenia was unexpected so far out from his 
last dose of chemotherapy.  However, with persistent Neupogen 
dosing the patient's ANC and total leukocyte counts gradually 
increased into a non-neutropenic state.  He was continued on 
vanc/cefepime/caspo until ANC > 1000, then all were discontinued 
since the patient had remained afebrile for > 48 hours and had 
persistently negative culture data.
.
At the time of discharge, the patient was with stable 
hematocrit, adequate pain control, stable O2 requirement, 
improving functional mobility, and good mental status.  The 
family would like to transition care to Hospice, likely at a 
long-term institution as this patient would be very difficult to 
care for at home.
.
Plan:
.
#. Hemoptysis: Recently extubated, with stable Hct and no 
visible hemoptysis.  IR options have been exhausted.  CT surgery 
has evaluated patient and would only take back to the OR if 
massive bleeding recurs.  IP and IR have exhausted all options.  
Patient will likely suffer recurrent bleeding and hemoptysis 
despite our best efforts.
-- QD Hct.  Would likely be very obvious if rebleeds.  
Transfused 1u PRBC [**3-2**].
-- End of life issues currently being addressed with family, SW 
involved, palliative care involved.
-- Patient recently extubated.  Follow pulmonary exam and VS for 
signs of decompensation.  Continue inhalers.  Nebs available 
PRN.
-- Respiratory status stable, slightly improved over last 
several days.
-- Hct slow decrease over past week, may be [**2-26**] decreased 
production.  1u PRBC transfused on [**3-2**].  No signs of active 
bleeding.  Hemolysis labs negative.
.
#. Fever/Neutropenia: Cause of neutropenia remains obscure, 
definitely a component of chemo-induced neutropenia, but also a 
possible component of HCL relapse.  Filgrastim being held now 
for lack of response.  Heme/Onc followed throughout 
hospitalization.  Off all abx currently, patient has not spiked 
a fever, although temps were increased last night.  Will 
continue to culture if spikes greater than 100.4.
-- Afebrile >72 hours, no F/C.
-- Off all abx since [**2-27**]
-- Culture if > 100.4
-- Have held filgrastim.
-- ANC each AM, CBC with diff
-- ANC decreased slightly over past 2 days, 810 the AM of 
discharge.  Per primary oncologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2609**] at [**Hospital3 **], 
this is close to his baseline.
.
#. NSCLC and HCL: Large tumor burden.  Chemo has been d/c'd due 
to pancytopenia.  Has gotten 24 doses of XRT.  Unclear if any 
further chemo/rads would be beneficial; will follow heme/onc 
recommendations.  Patient of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2609**] as outpatient.
-- Appreciate Heme/onc recommendations, unsure if palliative 
chemo/rads would be indicated.  Certainly chemo could not be 
undertaken right now due to low blood counts.  Completed 24 
doses of XRT prior to admission.
-- Follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2609**] after discharge
-- No filgrastim for now as above
-- Morphine PRN for pain
.
#. History of positive PPD: Continuing INH as per previous.  
Been on therapy since september or [**2949-10-25**], started 
after low grade fevers and cough with positive PPD.
-- Continue INH for now.
.
#. History of salmonella sepsis: Patient on chronic levaquin as 
outpatient for this.  Have resumed after d/c of F&N coverage.
-- Continue levaquin prophylaxis.
.
#. LE edema: EF normal on echo, although ? of ASD.  No 
intervention would be warranted at this time as pressures appear 
normal and no evidence of shunting with saline contrast.  Due to 
strong cancer history, concern for LE DVTs.  LENIs checked prior 
to discharge.
-- R popliteal DVT seen on [**3-3**], very distal with no proximal 
extension
-- *** This should be followed up in 1 week to assess for 
proximal extension ***
-- Patient would be an extremely poor candidate for 
anticoagulation
.
#. Hyperglycemia(?): Patient on RISS, has had several high FS 
recorded.  Will continue RISS for now, as tight glycemic control 
is likely to be beneficial from an ID standpoint.  
-- Continue RISS
.
#. Hypertension: Transitioned from labetolol to metoprolol.  
Will follow BP and titrate up B-blocker as tolerated/required. 
-- Follow BP and titrate metoprolol as needed, good control 
recently.
.
#. MS changes: Seems improved greatly since transfer out of ICU. 
 Patient with likely ICU delirium, fluctuant mental status.  
Pain control medications likely not helping this.  At time of 
discharge patient was A&Ox3.
-- Consider low dose IV haldol if recurrs
.
#. Prostate CA: History of prostate CA s/p radiation treatment 
in [**2949**].  Patient reports significant urinary 
frequency/hesitancy at home.
-- Patient unable to void yesterday, straight cath'ed with 600cc 
drainage and patient relief.  Foley left in place.  
-- Started Flomax at outpatient dose.
-- Should have voiding trial with d/c foley after transfer to 
rehab.
.
#. Dysuria: Developed dysuria [**3-1**].  Have d/c'd foley and checked 
UA, cx.  UA with 50 RBC, 0-2 WBC, moderate bacteria.
-- Levaquin ongoing.
-- Urine culture negative
.
#. Diarrhea: New onset of diarrhea over weekend, moderate in 
severity.  Have sent for c. diff, would be at risk for this 
given recent ICU stay and broad spectrum antibiotics.
-- C. diff negative.
.
#. FEN: General diet, soft with thin liquids per S&S.  Will 
provide IVF as needed to keep I/O even.  Replete lytes PRN.
.
#. PPX: No heparin [**2-26**] bleeding risk.  On PPI, will continue.  
Elevate HOB > 30 degrees.  Fall precautions.
.
#. Code: DNR/DNI following discussion with wife, who is HCP.  
Confirmed again with patient prior to discharge on [**3-3**].  Patient 
is not to be intubated or rescucitated under any circumstances.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  64-year-old man with nonsmall cell lung carcinoma and massive
     hemoptysis.  Bronchoscopy localized the bleeding to the right upper lobe.
     
     PHYSICIANS:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 60**] [**Name (STitle) 41**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6**], the attending radiologist, being present and
     supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Following written informed consent from the patient's wife, he was
     positioned supine on the angiography table.  Preprocedure timeout was
     performed to confirm patient, procedure, and site.  Standard sterile prep and
     drape of the inguinal regions.  Local anesthesia with 10 cc of 1% lidocaine
     subcutaneously.  Using palpatory and fluoroscopic guidance, a 19-gauge single
     wall puncture of the right common femoral artery was performed.  A 0.035-inch
     guidewire was advanced through the needle into the abdominal aorta using
     fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was exchanged for a 5-French vascular
     sheath.  Initially, the bronchial arteries were attempted the selected by a
     Mikaelsson and then [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1932**] II catheter.  These were unsuccessful.  A
     descending thoracic aortogram was performed through the [**Doctor Last Name 1932**] catheter,
     which demonstrated patency of the descending thoracic aorta but did not
     adequately opacify the bronchial arteries.  A different obliquity was obtained
     and descending thoracic aortography was repeated through the [**Doctor Last Name 1932**] catheter.
     This demonstrated dilated vessels leading towards the right upper lobe of the
     lung arising from the right posterolateral aspect of the descending thoracic
     aorta.  These again were attempted to be cannulated, but unsuccessful.  As
     such, the catheter was exchanged for a pigtail catheter and a descending
     thoracic aortogram was performed in another obliquity.  This demonstrated
     dilated tortuous arteries leading towards the right upper lobe of the lung
     with hypervascularity in this region on the parenchymal phase.  The distal
     aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta are patent.  There is calcification
     of the aortic arch.  The orifice of the artery leading towards the right upper
     lobe of the lung was better seen in this obliquity and we were able to select
     it using an H-1 catheter.  Arteriography was performed, which demonstrated

     dilated tortuous arteries leading towards the right upper lobe of the lung
     with hypervascularity on the parenchymal phase.  The right superior pulmonary
     vein is patent on the venous phase.  Based on the clinical history and the
     angiographic findings, it was determined that the patient would be a suitable
     candidate for and may benefit from embolization.  Embolization was performed
     from this catheter position using [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8315**] micrometer polyvinyl alcohol
     particles.  Embolization was performed until near stasis of blood flow.  The
     catheter was then exchanged for the pigtail catheter and a descending thoracic
     aortogram was performed.  This demonstrated absence of flow beyond the
     proximal vessel to the right upper lobe that was embolized.  However, a branch
     from this vessel in its proximal aspect supplying the right upper lobe was now
     visualized, which was not visualized previously.  As such, the pigtail
     catheter was exchanged for the H-1 catheter and this vessel was selected. 
     Arteriography of this branch of the right bronchial artery was performed. 
     This confirmed supply to the right upper lobe.  There were areas of
     hypervascularity associated with this vessel on the parenchymal phase.  This
     vessel was then embolized with [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8315**] micrometer polyvinyl alcohol particles
     until near stasis of blood flow.
     
     As no other systemic arterial supply to the right upper lobe was identified,
     all catheters, wires and the sheath were removed and hemostasis was ensured
     with direct manual compression.
     
     Total of 290 cc of Optiray 320 radiographic contrast was utilized.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  64-year-old man with nonsmall cell lung carcinoma and massive
     hemoptysis.  Bronchoscopy localized the bleeding to the right upper lobe.
     
     PHYSICIANS:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 60**] [**Name (STitle) 41**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6**], the attending radiologist, being present and
     supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Following written informed consent from the patient's wife, he was
     positioned supine on the angiography table.  Preprocedure timeout was
     performed to confirm patient, procedure, and site.  Standard sterile prep and
     drape of the inguinal regions.  Local anesthesia with 10 cc of 1% lidocaine
     subcutaneously.  Using palpatory and fluoroscopic guidance, a 19-gauge single
     wall puncture of the right common femoral artery was performed.  A 0.035-inch
     guidewire was advanced through the needle into the abdominal aorta using
     fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was exchanged for a 5-French vascular
     sheath.  Initially, the bronchial arteries were attempted the selected by a
     Mikaelsson and then [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1932**] II catheter.  These were unsuccessful.  A
     descending thoracic aortogram was performed through the [**Doctor Last Name 1932**] catheter,
     which demonstrated patency of the descending thoracic aorta but did not
     adequately opacify the bronchial arteries.  A different obliquity was obtained
     and descending thoracic aortography was repeated through the [**Doctor Last Name 1932**] catheter.
     This demonstrated dilated vessels leading towards the right upper lobe of the
     lung arising from the right posterolateral aspect of the descending thoracic
     aorta.  These again were attempted to be cannulated, but unsuccessful.  As
     such, the catheter was exchanged for a pigtail catheter and a descending
     thoracic aortogram was performed in another obliquity.  This demonstrated
     dilated tortuous arteries leading towards the right upper lobe of the lung
     with hypervascularity in this region on the parenchymal phase.  The distal
     aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta are patent.  There is calcification
     of the aortic arch.  The orifice of the artery leading towards the right upper
     lobe of the lung was better seen in this obliquity and we were able to select
     it using an H-1 catheter.  Arteriography was performed, which demonstrated
                                                                 (Over)

     proximal vessel to the right upper lobe that was embolized.  However, a branch
     from this vessel in its proximal aspect supplying the right upper lobe was now
     visualized, which was not visualized previously.  As such, the pigtail
     catheter was exchanged for the H-1 catheter and this vessel was selected. 
     Arteriography of this branch of the right bronchial artery was performed. 
     This confirmed supply to the right upper lobe.  There were areas of
     hypervascularity associated with this vessel on the parenchymal phase.  This
     vessel was then embolized with [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8315**] micrometer polyvinyl alcohol particles
     until near stasis of blood flow.
     
     As no other systemic arterial supply to the right upper lobe was identified,
     all catheters, wires and the sheath were removed and hemostasis was ensured
     with direct manual compression.
     
     Total of 290 cc of Optiray 320 radiographic contrast was utilized.
     
     There were no immediate complications.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  64-year-old man with nonsmall cell lung carcinoma and massive
     hemoptysis.  Bronchoscopy localized the bleeding to the right upper lobe.
     
     PHYSICIANS:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 60**] [**Name (STitle) 41**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6**], the attending radiologist, being present and
     supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Following written informed consent from the patient's wife, he was
     positioned supine on the angiography table.  Preprocedure timeout was
     performed to confirm patient, procedure, and site.  Standard sterile prep and
     drape of the inguinal regions.  Local anesthesia with 10 cc of 1% lidocaine
     subcutaneously.  Using palpatory and fluoroscopic guidance, a 19-gauge single
     wall puncture of the right common femoral artery was performed.  A 0.035-inch
     guidewire was advanced through the needle into the abdominal aorta using
     fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was exchanged for a 5-French vascular
     sheath.  Initially, the bronchial arteries were attempted the selected by a
     Mikaelsson and then [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1932**] II catheter.  These were unsuccessful.  A
     descending thoracic aortogram was performed through the [**Doctor Last Name 1932**] catheter,
     which demonstrated patency of the descending thoracic aorta but did not
     adequately opacify the bronchial arteries.  A different obliquity was obtained
     and descending thoracic aortography was repeated through the [**Doctor Last Name 1932**] catheter.
     This demonstrated dilated vessels leading towards the right upper lobe of the
     lung arising from the right posterolateral aspect of the descending thoracic
     aorta.  These again were attempted to be cannulated, but unsuccessful.  As
     such, the catheter was exchanged for a pigtail catheter and a descending
     thoracic aortogram was performed in another obliquity.  This demonstrated
     dilated tortuous arteries leading towards the right upper lobe of the lung
     with hypervascularity in this region on the parenchymal phase.  The distal
     aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta are patent.  There is calcification
     of the aortic arch.  The orifice of the artery leading towards the right upper
     lobe of the lung was better seen in this obliquity and we were able to select
     it using an H-1 catheter.  Arteriography was performed, which demonstrated
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  64-year-old man with nonsmall cell lung carcinoma and massive
     hemoptysis.  Bronchoscopy localized the bleeding to the right upper lobe.
     
     PHYSICIANS:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 60**] [**Name (STitle) 41**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6**], the attending radiologist, being present and
     supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Following written informed consent from the patient's wife, he was
     positioned supine on the angiography table.  Preprocedure timeout was
     performed to confirm patient, procedure, and site.  Standard sterile prep and
     drape of the inguinal regions.  Local anesthesia with 10 cc of 1% lidocaine
     subcutaneously.  Using palpatory and fluoroscopic guidance, a 19-gauge single
     wall puncture of the right common femoral artery was performed.  A 0.035-inch
     guidewire was advanced through the needle into the abdominal aorta using
     fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was exchanged for a 5-French vascular
     sheath.  Initially, the bronchial arteries were attempted the selected by a
     Mikaelsson and then [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1932**] II catheter.  These were unsuccessful.  A
     descending thoracic aortogram was performed through the [**Doctor Last Name 1932**] catheter,
     which demonstrated patency of the descending thoracic aorta but did not
     adequately opacify the bronchial arteries.  A different obliquity was obtained
     and descending thoracic aortography was repeated through the [**Doctor Last Name 1932**] catheter.
     This demonstrated dilated vessels leading towards the right upper lobe of the
     lung arising from the right posterolateral aspect of the descending thoracic
     aorta.  These again were attempted to be cannulated, but unsuccessful.  As
     such, the catheter was exchanged for a pigtail catheter and a descending
     thoracic aortogram was performed in another obliquity.  This demonstrated
     dilated tortuous arteries leading towards the right upper lobe of the lung
     with hypervascularity in this region on the parenchymal phase.  The distal
     aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta are patent.  There is calcification
     of the aortic arch.  The orifice of the artery leading towards the right upper
     lobe of the lung was better seen in this obliquity and we were able to select
     it using an H-1 catheter.  Arteriography was performed, which demonstrated
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     dilated tortuous arteries leading towards the right upper lobe of the lung
     with hypervascularity on the parenchymal phase.  The right superior pulmonary
     vein is patent on the venous phase.  Based on the clinical history and the
     angiographic findings, it was determined that the patient would be a suitable
     candidate for and may benefit from embolization.  Embolization was performed
     from this catheter position using [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8315**] micrometer polyvinyl alcohol
     particles.  Embolization was performed until near stasis of blood flow.  The
     catheter was then exchanged for the pigtail catheter and a descending thoracic
     aortogram was performed.  This demonstrated absence of flow beyond the
     proximal vessel to the right upper lobe that was embolized.  However, a branch
     from this vessel in its proximal aspect supplying the right upper lobe was now
     visualized, which was not visualized previously.  As such, the pigtail
     catheter was exchanged for the H-1 catheter and this vessel was selected. 
     Arteriography of this branch of the right bronchial artery was performed. 
     This confirmed supply to the right upper lobe.  There were areas of
     hypervascularity associated with this vessel on the parenchymal phase.  This
     vessel was then embolized with [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8315**] micrometer polyvinyl alcohol particles
     until near stasis of blood flow.
     
     As no other systemic arterial supply to the right upper lobe was identified,
     all catheters, wires and the sheath were removed and hemostasis was ensured
     with direct manual compression.
     
     Total of 290 cc of Optiray 320 radiographic contrast was utilized.
     
     There were no immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Angiographically successful embolization of systemic arterial
     supply to the right upper lobe of the lung using [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8315**] micrometer polyvinyl
     alcohol particles.  Embolization was performed in 2 separate branches of the
     right bronchial artery.

       64 year old man with NSCL CA presenting intubated with hemoptysis.             
        
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      evaluate for infiltrate

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Non-small cell lung cancer, intubated with hemoptysis.  Evaluate
     for pneumonia.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Single portal AP radiograph, compared with [**2950-2-16**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There has been a decrease in the minimal residual aerated right
     lung, with corresponding increase in the pleural effusion/mass. There is also
     of the right bronchial lumen, but no significant shift of the cardiac or
     mediastinal silhouettes towards the right.
     
     The left hemithorax appears clear.  The visible portions of the cardiac and
     mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable, although the left heart border is
     obscured. Endotracheal tube extends to approximately 4 cm above the carina,
     and NG tube extends into the stomach, although the distal tip is beyond the
     inferior confines of this study.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Increased right pleural mass/effusion, and slightly decreased
     aerated lung seen on the right--we cannot distinguish superimposed pneumonia
     from atelectasis or neoplasm.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      64 year old man with nsc lung CA                                                
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      eval for left bronchial artery embolization                                     
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: Leukemia, prostate cancer, non-small cell lung cancer in right upper
     lobe with hemoptysis from the right upper lobe on bronchoscopy. Right
     bronchial artery previously embolized two days ago. Now with recurrent
     bleeding.
     
     PHYSICIANS: Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 60**] [**Name (STitle) 41**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 79**] [**Doctor Last Name 43**] d'Othee performed the
     procedure with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 43**] [**Name (STitle) 44**], the attending radiologist, being present and
     supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: Following written informed consent from the patient's
     wife, the patient was positioned supine on the angiography table. Preprocedure
     timeout was performed to confirm patient, procedure, and site. Standard
     sterile prep and drape of the right inguinal region. Using palpatory and
     fluoroscopic guidance, a single wall puncture of the right common femoral
     artery was performed with a 19-gauge needle. A 0.035-inch guidewire was passed
     through the needle into the abdominal aorta using fluoroscopic guidance. The
     needle was exchanged for a 5-French vascular sheath, which was attached to a
     continuous heparinized saline flush. A Berenstein catheter was used to select
     the right subclavian artery.
     
     Right subclavian arteriography demonstrated patency of the subclavian, right
     internal mammary, thyrocervical trunk, lateral thoracic artery, and
     costocervical trunk. The catheter tip was beyond the vertebral artery and this
     was poorly opacified on this run. Multiple branches of the right lateral
     thoracic artery are visualized to supply the right upper lobe of the lung
                                                                 (Over)

     which is hypervascular with filling of the right upper pulmonary vein on the
     arterial phase consistent with arteriovenous shunting within the lung. Supply
     to the right upper lobe of the lung is also visualized from a branch of the
     right internal mammary artery.
     
     The right lateral thoracic artery was then selected and arteriography
     performed. This demonstrated patency of this vessel with supply to a
     hypervascular area of the right upper lobe of the lung with early venous
     filling of the right upper pulmonary vein consistent with arteriovenous
     shunting. Based on the patient's history and the diagnostic arteriogram, it
     was determined that the patient would be a good candidate for and may benefit
     from embolization. A 3-French microcatheter was placed through the Berenstein
     catheter and used to select two branches of the lateral thoracic artery. These
     branches and a segment of the lateral thoracic artery itself were embolized
     with multiple microcoils.
     
     Right lateral thoracic arteriography performed post-embolization demonstrated
     cessation of flow to the right upper lobe of the lung. The non-embolized
     branches of this artery remained patent. Several arteriograms of the branch
     vessels of the right lateral thoracic artery were performed during the course
     of the embolization to confirm which branches of the vessel required
     embolization and to test the success of embolization. Two branches of the
     lateral thoracic artery were selected.
     
     The microcatheter was removed and the Berenstein catheter was retracted into
     the right subclavian artery and right subclavian arteriography was performed.
     This demonstrated patency of the right subclavian artery, right internal
     mammary artery, visualized portion of the right vertebral artery, right
     thyrocervical trunk, right costocervical trunk, and the non-embolized portion
     of the right lateral thoracic artery. The embolized portions of the right
     lateral thoracic artery demonstrated no flow. Arterial supply to the right
     upper lobe of the lung was demonstrated from branch of the right internal
     mammary artery. The area of lung supplied as abnormal hypervascularity and
     arteriovenous shunting to the right upper pulmonary vein is demonstrated from
     this region.
     
     The right internal mammary artery was selected with the Berenstein catheter
     and arteriography was performed. This demonstrated patency of the right
     internal mammary artery and its major branches. A proximal branch of the right
     internal mammary artery supplies the right upper lobe of the lung in an
     abnormal hypervascular area with arteriovenous shunting to the right upper
     pulmonary vein. This proximal branch of the right internal mammary artery was
     selected with the Tracker microcatheter. This was embolized with multiple
     microcoils. Arteriography in this vessel was performed demonstrating cessation
     of flow in the embolized areas with some flow through the more proximal coils.
                                                                 (Over)

     As such, further coil embolization was undertaken in addition to embolization
     with a total of 1 ml of absolute alcohol given in two divided doses of 0.5 ml
     each. The microcatheter was then removed and right internal mammary
     arteriography was performed through the Berenstein catheter. This demonstrated
     complete cessation of flow through the proximal branch that had previously
     been supplying the right upper lobe of the lung. Remainder of the right
     internal mammary artery and its major branches remain patent. However, now at
     least two other branches of the right internal mammary artery demonstrate
     arterial supply to abnormal hypervascular areas of the right upper lobe of the
     lung. These were not demonstrated on the earlier (pre-embolization) right
     internal mammary arteriogram. This suggests that embolization of one arterial
     branch leads to recruitment of other arterial branches to the right upper
     lobe.
     
     At this stage, the Berenstein catheter was retracted into the right subclavian
     artery and right subclavian arteriography was performed. This demonstrated
     patency of the right subclavian artery, right internal mammary artery,
     visualized portion of the right vertebral artery, right paracervical trunk,
     right costocervical trunk, and non-embolized portions of the right lateral
     thoracic artery. No flow is seen through the embolized arteries. Arterial
     blood supply to the right upper lobe of the lung is seen from branches of the
     right internal mammary artery. No other definite arterial supply to the right
     upper lobe of the lung is demonstrated from the right subclavian artery or its
     branches.
     
     The Berenstein catheter was then exchanged over the guidewire for a pigtail
     catheter which was positioned in the proximal descending thoracic aorta.
     Descending thoracic aortography was performed. This demonstrated that the
     arterial supply to the right upper lobe of the lung from the aorta that had
     been previously embolized remained patent proximally, but no hypervascular
     lung was demonstrated. This would be consistent with the parenchymal level
     particle embolization that was previously performed.
     
     The case was then discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8318**] (Pneumology). Based on
     these discussions and the findings of the arteriogram (in particular, the
     finding that embolization of one arterial supply to the right upper lobe leads
     to the development/visualization of other new arterial supplies to the right
     upper lobe), it was determined that further embolization may not be of use.
     
     All wires, catheters and the sheath were removed. Hemostasis was ensured with
     direct manual compression. There were no immediate complications.
     
     MEDICATIONS: Total of 10 cc of 1% lidocaine subcutaneously was used for local
     anesthetic in the right inguinal region. A total of 345 cc of Optiray 320
     intra-arterial radiographic contrast was utilized.
                                                                 (Over)

     A total of 24 coils were used for embolization (six 2 mm x 10 mm coils, two 4
     mm x 40 mm coils, six 4 mm x 3 cm coils, six 4 mm x 2 cm coils, and four 2 mm
     x 1 cm coils).
     
     IMPRESSION: Multiple collateral arteries were found to be supplying the right
     upper lobe of the lung from the right subclavian artery branches (right
     lateral thoracic artery and right internal mammary artery). The right lateral
     thoracic artery and two of its branches and one branch of the right internal
     mammary artery were embolized with microcoils. Residual vessels supplying the
     right upper lobe tumor are still present and these only became apparent after
     embolization of the other vessels. As such, there is evidence that
     embolization of some feeding vessels leads to recruitment other feeding
     vessels and it was determined that further embolization may not be of use.
     Note that arteriovenous shunting within the right upper lobe of the lung was
     present into the right upper pulmonary vein.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: Leukemia, prostate cancer, non-small cell lung cancer in right upper
     lobe with hemoptysis from the right upper lobe on bronchoscopy. Right
     bronchial artery previously embolized two days ago. Now with recurrent
     bleeding.
     
     PHYSICIANS: Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 60**] [**Name (STitle) 41**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 79**] [**Doctor Last Name 43**] d'Othee performed the
     procedure with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 43**] [**Name (STitle) 44**], the attending radiologist, being present and
     supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: Following written informed consent from the patient's
     wife, the patient was positioned supine on the angiography table. Preprocedure
     timeout was performed to confirm patient, procedure, and site. Standard
     sterile prep and drape of the right inguinal region. Using palpatory and
     fluoroscopic guidance, a single wall puncture of the right common femoral
     artery was performed with a 19-gauge needle. A 0.035-inch guidewire was passed
     through the needle into the abdominal aorta using fluoroscopic guidance. The
     needle was exchanged for a 5-French vascular sheath, which was attached to a
     continuous heparinized saline flush. A Berenstein catheter was used to select
     the right subclavian artery.
     
     Right subclavian arteriography demonstrated patency of the subclavian, right
     internal mammary, thyrocervical trunk, lateral thoracic artery, and
     costocervical trunk. The catheter tip was beyond the vertebral artery and this
     was poorly opacified on this run. Multiple branches of the right lateral
     thoracic artery are visualized to supply the right upper lobe of the lung
                                                                 (Over)

     which is hypervascular with filling of the right upper pulmonary vein on the
     arterial phase consistent with arteriovenous shunting within the lung. Supply
     to the right upper lobe of the lung is also visualized from a branch of the
     right internal mammary artery.
     
     The right lateral thoracic artery was then selected and arteriography
     performed. This demonstrated patency of this vessel with supply to a
     hypervascular area of the right upper lobe of the lung with early venous
     filling of the right upper pulmonary vein consistent with arteriovenous
     shunting. Based on the patient's history and the diagnostic arteriogram, it
     was determined that the patient would be a good candidate for and may benefit
     from embolization. A 3-French microcatheter was placed through the Berenstein
     catheter and used to select two branches of the lateral thoracic artery. These
     branches and a segment of the lateral thoracic artery itself were embolized
     with multiple microcoils.
     
     Right lateral thoracic arteriography performed post-embolization demonstrated
     cessation of flow to the right upper lobe of the lung. The non-embolized
     branches of this artery remained patent. Several arteriograms of the branch
     vessels of the right lateral thoracic artery were performed during the course
     of the embolization to confirm which branches of the vessel required
     embolization and to test the success of embolization. Two branches of the
     lateral thoracic artery were selected.
     
     The microcatheter was removed and the Berenstein catheter was retracted into
     the right subclavian artery and right subclavian arteriography was performed.
     This demonstrated patency of the right subclavian artery, right internal
     mammary artery, visualized portion of the right vertebral artery, right
     thyrocervical trunk, right costocervical trunk, and the non-embolized portion
     of the right lateral thoracic artery. The embolized portions of the right
     lateral thoracic artery demonstrated no flow. Arterial supply to the right
     upper lobe of the lung was demonstrated from branch of the right internal
     mammary artery. The area of lung supplied as abnormal hypervascularity and
     arteriovenous shunting to the right upper pulmonary vein is demonstrated from
     this region.
     
     The right internal mammary artery was selected with the Berenstein catheter
     and arteriography was performed. This demonstrated patency of the right
     internal mammary artery and its major branches. A proximal branch of the right
     internal mammary artery supplies the right upper lobe of the lung in an
     abnormal hypervascular area with arteriovenous shunting to the right upper
     pulmonary vein. This proximal branch of the right internal mammary artery was
     selected with the Tracker microcatheter. This was embolized with multiple
     microcoils. Arteriography in this vessel was performed demonstrating cessation
     of flow in the embolized areas with some flow through the more proximal coils.
                                                                 (Over)

     As such, further coil embolization was undertaken in addition to embolization
     with a total of 1 ml of absolute alcohol given in two divided doses of 0.5 ml
     each. The microcatheter was then removed and right internal mammary
     arteriography was performed through the Berenstein catheter. This demonstrated
     complete cessation of flow through the proximal branch that had previously
     been supplying the right upper lobe of the lung. Remainder of the right
     internal mammary artery and its major branches remain patent. However, now at
     least two other branches of the right internal mammary artery demonstrate
     arterial supply to abnormal hypervascular areas of the right upper lobe of the
     lung. These were not demonstrated on the earlier (pre-embolization) right
     internal mammary arteriogram. This suggests that embolization of one arterial
     branch leads to recruitment of other arterial branches to the right upper
     lobe.
     
     At this stage, the Berenstein catheter was retracted into the right subclavian
     artery and right subclavian arteriography was performed. This demonstrated
     patency of the right subclavian artery, right internal mammary artery,
     visualized portion of the right vertebral artery, right paracervical trunk,
     right costocervical trunk, and non-embolized portions of the right lateral
     thoracic artery. No flow is seen through the embolized arteries. Arterial
     blood supply to the right upper lobe of the lung is seen from branches of the
     right internal mammary artery. No other definite arterial supply to the right
     upper lobe of the lung is demonstrated from the right subclavian artery or its
     branches.
     
     The Berenstein catheter was then exchanged over the guidewire for a pigtail
     catheter which was positioned in the proximal descending thoracic aorta.
     Descending thoracic aortography was performed. This demonstrated that the
     arterial supply to the right upper lobe of the lung from the aorta that had
     been previously embolized remained patent proximally, but no hypervascular
     lung was demonstrated. This would be consistent with the parenchymal level
     particle embolization that was previously performed.
     
     The case was then discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8318**] (Pneumology). Based on
     these discussions and the findings of the arteriogram (in particular, the
     finding that embolization of one arterial supply to the right upper lobe leads
     to the development/visualization of other new arterial supplies to the right
     upper lobe), it was determined that further embolization may not be of use.
     
     All wires, catheters and the sheath were removed. Hemostasis was ensured with
     direct manual compression. There were no immediate complications.
     
     MEDICATIONS: Total of 10 cc of 1% lidocaine subcutaneously was used for local
     anesthetic in the right inguinal region. A total of 345 cc of Optiray 320
     intra-arterial radiographic contrast was utilized.
                                                                 (Over)

     A total of 24 coils were used for embolization (six 2 mm x 10 mm coils, two 4
     mm x 40 mm coils, six 4 mm x 3 cm coils, six 4 mm x 2 cm coils, and four 2 mm
     x 1 cm coils).
     
     IMPRESSION: Multiple collateral arteries were found to be supplying the right
     upper lobe of the lung from the right subclavian artery branches (right
     lateral thoracic artery and right internal mammary artery). The right lateral
     thoracic artery and two of its branches and one branch of the right internal
     mammary artery were embolized with microcoils. Residual vessels supplying the
     right upper lobe tumor are still present and these only became apparent after
     embolization of the other vessels. As such, there is evidence that
     embolization of some feeding vessels leads to recruitment other feeding
     vessels and it was determined that further embolization may not be of use.
     Note that arteriovenous shunting within the right upper lobe of the lung was
     present into the right upper pulmonary vein.

     least two other branches of the right internal mammary artery demonstrate
     arterial supply to abnormal hypervascular areas of the right upper lobe of the
     lung. These were not demonstrated on the earlier (pre-embolization) right
     internal mammary arteriogram. This suggests that embolization of one arterial
     branch leads to recruitment of other arterial branches to the right upper
     lobe.
     
     At this stage, the Berenstein catheter was retracted into the right subclavian
     artery and right subclavian arteriography was performed. This demonstrated
     patency of the right subclavian artery, right internal mammary artery,
     visualized portion of the right vertebral artery, right paracervical trunk,
     right costocervical trunk, and non-embolized portions of the right lateral
     thoracic artery. No flow is seen through the embolized arteries. Arterial
     blood supply to the right upper lobe of the lung is seen from branches of the
     right internal mammary artery. No other definite arterial supply to the right
     upper lobe of the lung is demonstrated from the right subclavian artery or its
     branches.
     
     The Berenstein catheter was then exchanged over the guidewire for a pigtail
     catheter which was positioned in the proximal descending thoracic aorta.
     Descending thoracic aortography was performed. This demonstrated that the
     arterial supply to the right upper lobe of the lung from the aorta that had
     been previously embolized remained patent proximally, but no hypervascular
     lung was demonstrated. This would be consistent with the parenchymal level
     particle embolization that was previously performed.
     
     The case was then discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8318**] (Pneumology). Based on
     these discussions and the findings of the arteriogram (in particular, the
     finding that embolization of one arterial supply to the right upper lobe leads
     to the development/visualization of other new arterial supplies to the right
     upper lobe), it was determined that further embolization may not be of use.
     
     All wires, catheters and the sheath were removed. Hemostasis was ensured with
     direct manual compression. There were no immediate complications.
     
     MEDICATIONS: Total of 10 cc of 1% lidocaine subcutaneously was used for local
     anesthetic in the right inguinal region. A total of 345 cc of Optiray 320
     intra-arterial radiographic contrast was utilized.
                                                                 (Over)

     A total of 24 coils were used for embolization (six 2 mm x 10 mm coils, two 4
     mm x 40 mm coils, six 4 mm x 3 cm coils, six 4 mm x 2 cm coils, and four 2 mm
     x 1 cm coils).
     
     IMPRESSION: Multiple collateral arteries were found to be supplying the right
     upper lobe of the lung from the right subclavian artery branches (right
     lateral thoracic artery and right internal mammary artery). The right lateral
     thoracic artery and two of its branches and one branch of the right internal
     mammary artery were embolized with microcoils. Residual vessels supplying the
     right upper lobe tumor are still present and these only became apparent after
     embolization of the other vessels. As such, there is evidence that
     embolization of some feeding vessels leads to recruitment other feeding
     vessels and it was determined that further embolization may not be of use.
     Note that arteriovenous shunting within the right upper lobe of the lung was
     present into the right upper pulmonary vein.

     HISTORY: Leukemia, prostate cancer, non-small cell lung cancer in right upper
     lobe with hemoptysis from the right upper lobe on bronchoscopy. Right
     bronchial artery previously embolized two days ago. Now with recurrent
     bleeding.
     
     PHYSICIANS: Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 60**] [**Name (STitle) 41**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 79**] [**Doctor Last Name 43**] d'Othee performed the
     procedure with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 43**] [**Name (STitle) 44**], the attending radiologist, being present and
     supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: Following written informed consent from the patient's
     wife, the patient was positioned supine on the angiography table. Preprocedure
     timeout was performed to confirm patient, procedure, and site. Standard
     sterile prep and drape of the right inguinal region. Using palpatory and
     fluoroscopic guidance, a single wall puncture of the right common femoral
     artery was performed with a 19-gauge needle. A 0.035-inch guidewire was passed
     through the needle into the abdominal aorta using fluoroscopic guidance. The
     needle was exchanged for a 5-French vascular sheath, which was attached to a
     continuous heparinized saline flush. A Berenstein catheter was used to select
     the right subclavian artery.
     
     Right subclavian arteriography demonstrated patency of the subclavian, right
     internal mammary, thyrocervical trunk, lateral thoracic artery, and
     costocervical trunk. The catheter tip was beyond the vertebral artery and this
     was poorly opacified on this run. Multiple branches of the right lateral
     thoracic artery are visualized to supply the right upper lobe of the lung
                                                                 (Over)

     which is hypervascular with filling of the right upper pulmonary vein on the
     arterial phase consistent with arteriovenous shunting within the lung. Supply
     to the right upper lobe of the lung is also visualized from a branch of the
     right internal mammary artery.
     
     The right lateral thoracic artery was then selected and arteriography
     performed. This demonstrated patency of this vessel with supply to a
     hypervascular area of the right upper lobe of the lung with early venous
     filling of the right upper pulmonary vein consistent with arteriovenous
     shunting. Based on the patient's history and the diagnostic arteriogram, it
     was determined that the patient would be a good candidate for and may benefit
     from embolization. A 3-French microcatheter was placed through the Berenstein
     catheter and used to select two branches of the lateral thoracic artery. These
     branches and a segment of the lateral thoracic artery itself were embolized
     with multiple microcoils.
     
     Right lateral thoracic arteriography performed post-embolization demonstrated
     cessation of flow to the right upper lobe of the lung. The non-embolized
     branches of this artery remained patent. Several arteriograms of the branch
     vessels of the right lateral thoracic artery were performed during the course
     of the embolization to confirm which branches of the vessel required
     embolization and to test the success of embolization. Two branches of the
     lateral thoracic artery were selected.
     
     The microcatheter was removed and the Berenstein catheter was retracted into
     the right subclavian artery and right subclavian arteriography was performed.
     This demonstrated patency of the right subclavian artery, right internal
     mammary artery, visualized portion of the right vertebral artery, right
     thyrocervical trunk, right costocervical trunk, and the non-embolized portion
     of the right lateral thoracic artery. The embolized portions of the right
     lateral thoracic artery demonstrated no flow. Arterial supply to the right
     upper lobe of the lung was demonstrated from branch of the right internal
     mammary artery. The area of lung supplied as abnormal hypervascularity and
     arteriovenous shunting to the right upper pulmonary vein is demonstrated from
     this region.
     
     The right internal mammary artery was selected with the Berenstein catheter
     and arteriography was performed. This demonstrated patency of the right
     internal mammary artery and its major branches. A proximal branch of the right
     internal mammary artery supplies the right upper lobe of the lung in an
     abnormal hypervascular area with arteriovenous shunting to the right upper
     pulmonary vein. This proximal branch of the right internal mammary artery was
     selected with the Tracker microcatheter. This was embolized with multiple
     microcoils. Arteriography in this vessel was performed demonstrating cessation
     of flow in the embolized areas with some flow through the more proximal coils.
                                                                 (Over)

     As such, further coil embolization was undertaken in addition to embolization
     with a total of 1 ml of absolute alcohol given in two divided doses of 0.5 ml
     each. The microcatheter was then removed and right internal mammary
     arteriography was performed through the Berenstein catheter. This demonstrated
     complete cessation of flow through the proximal branch that had previously
     been supplying the right upper lobe of the lung. Remainder of the right
     internal mammary artery and its major branches remain patent. However, now at

     of the embolization to confirm which branches of the vessel required
     embolization and to test the success of embolization. Two branches of the
     lateral thoracic artery were selected.
     
     The microcatheter was removed and the Berenstein catheter was retracted into
     the right subclavian artery and right subclavian arteriography was performed.
     This demonstrated patency of the right subclavian artery, right internal
     mammary artery, visualized portion of the right vertebral artery, right
     thyrocervical trunk, right costocervical trunk, and the non-embolized portion
     of the right lateral thoracic artery. The embolized portions of the right
     lateral thoracic artery demonstrated no flow. Arterial supply to the right
     upper lobe of the lung was demonstrated from branch of the right internal
     mammary artery. The area of lung supplied as abnormal hypervascularity and
     arteriovenous shunting to the right upper pulmonary vein is demonstrated from
     this region.
     
     The right internal mammary artery was selected with the Berenstein catheter
     and arteriography was performed. This demonstrated patency of the right
     internal mammary artery and its major branches. A proximal branch of the right
     internal mammary artery supplies the right upper lobe of the lung in an
     abnormal hypervascular area with arteriovenous shunting to the right upper
     pulmonary vein. This proximal branch of the right internal mammary artery was
     selected with the Tracker microcatheter. This was embolized with multiple
     microcoils. Arteriography in this vessel was performed demonstrating cessation
     of flow in the embolized areas with some flow through the more proximal coils.
                                                                 (Over)

     As such, further coil embolization was undertaken in addition to embolization
     with a total of 1 ml of absolute alcohol given in two divided doses of 0.5 ml
     each. The microcatheter was then removed and right internal mammary
     arteriography was performed through the Berenstein catheter. This demonstrated
     complete cessation of flow through the proximal branch that had previously
     been supplying the right upper lobe of the lung. Remainder of the right
     internal mammary artery and its major branches remain patent. However, now at
     least two other branches of the right internal mammary artery demonstrate
     arterial supply to abnormal hypervascular areas of the right upper lobe of the
     lung. These were not demonstrated on the earlier (pre-embolization) right
     internal mammary arteriogram. This suggests that embolization of one arterial
     branch leads to recruitment of other arterial branches to the right upper
     lobe.
     
     At this stage, the Berenstein catheter was retracted into the right subclavian
     artery and right subclavian arteriography was performed. This demonstrated
     patency of the right subclavian artery, right internal mammary artery,
     visualized portion of the right vertebral artery, right paracervical trunk,
     right costocervical trunk, and non-embolized portions of the right lateral
     thoracic artery. No flow is seen through the embolized arteries. Arterial
     blood supply to the right upper lobe of the lung is seen from branches of the
     right internal mammary artery. No other definite arterial supply to the right
     upper lobe of the lung is demonstrated from the right subclavian artery or its
     branches.
     
     The Berenstein catheter was then exchanged over the guidewire for a pigtail
     catheter which was positioned in the proximal descending thoracic aorta.
     Descending thoracic aortography was performed. This demonstrated that the
     arterial supply to the right upper lobe of the lung from the aorta that had
     been previously embolized remained patent proximally, but no hypervascular
     lung was demonstrated. This would be consistent with the parenchymal level
     particle embolization that was previously performed.
     
     The case was then discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8318**] (Pneumology). Based on
     these discussions and the findings of the arteriogram (in particular, the
     finding that embolization of one arterial supply to the right upper lobe leads
     to the development/visualization of other new arterial supplies to the right
     upper lobe), it was determined that further embolization may not be of use.
     
     All wires, catheters and the sheath were removed. Hemostasis was ensured with
     direct manual compression. There were no immediate complications.
     
     MEDICATIONS: Total of 10 cc of 1% lidocaine subcutaneously was used for local
     anesthetic in the right inguinal region. A total of 345 cc of Optiray 320
     intra-arterial radiographic contrast was utilized.
                                                                 (Over)

     A total of 24 coils were used for embolization (six 2 mm x 10 mm coils, two 4

     x 1 cm coils).
     
     IMPRESSION: Multiple collateral arteries were found to be supplying the right
     upper lobe of the lung from the right subclavian artery branches (right
     lateral thoracic artery and right internal mammary artery). The right lateral
     thoracic artery and two of its branches and one branch of the right internal

     HISTORY: Leukemia, prostate cancer, non-small cell lung cancer in right upper
     lobe with hemoptysis from the right upper lobe on bronchoscopy. Right
     bronchial artery previously embolized two days ago. Now with recurrent
     bleeding.
     
     PHYSICIANS: Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 60**] [**Name (STitle) 41**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 79**] [**Doctor Last Name 43**] d'Othee performed the
     procedure with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 43**] [**Name (STitle) 44**], the attending radiologist, being present and
     supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: Following written informed consent from the patient's
     wife, the patient was positioned supine on the angiography table. Preprocedure
     timeout was performed to confirm patient, procedure, and site. Standard
     sterile prep and drape of the right inguinal region. Using palpatory and
     fluoroscopic guidance, a single wall puncture of the right common femoral
     artery was performed with a 19-gauge needle. A 0.035-inch guidewire was passed
     through the needle into the abdominal aorta using fluoroscopic guidance. The
     needle was exchanged for a 5-French vascular sheath, which was attached to a
     continuous heparinized saline flush. A Berenstein catheter was used to select
     the right subclavian artery.
     
     Right subclavian arteriography demonstrated patency of the subclavian, right
     internal mammary, thyrocervical trunk, lateral thoracic artery, and
     costocervical trunk. The catheter tip was beyond the vertebral artery and this
     was poorly opacified on this run. Multiple branches of the right lateral
     thoracic artery are visualized to supply the right upper lobe of the lung

     which is hypervascular with filling of the right upper pulmonary vein on the
     arterial phase consistent with arteriovenous shunting within the lung. Supply
     to the right upper lobe of the lung is also visualized from a branch of the
     right internal mammary artery.
     
     The right lateral thoracic artery was then selected and arteriography
     performed. This demonstrated patency of this vessel with supply to a
     hypervascular area of the right upper lobe of the lung with early venous
     filling of the right upper pulmonary vein consistent with arteriovenous
     shunting. Based on the patient's history and the diagnostic arteriogram, it
     was determined that the patient would be a good candidate for and may benefit
     from embolization. A 3-French microcatheter was placed through the Berenstein
     catheter and used to select two branches of the lateral thoracic artery. These
     branches and a segment of the lateral thoracic artery itself were embolized
     with multiple microcoils.
     
     Right lateral thoracic arteriography performed post-embolization demonstrated
     cessation of flow to the right upper lobe of the lung. The non-embolized
     branches of this artery remained patent. Several arteriograms of the branch
     vessels of the right lateral thoracic artery were performed during the course
     of the embolization to confirm which branches of the vessel required
     embolization and to test the success of embolization. Two branches of the
     lateral thoracic artery were selected.
     
     The microcatheter was removed and the Berenstein catheter was retracted into

     This demonstrated patency of the right subclavian artery, right internal
     mammary artery, visualized portion of the right vertebral artery, right
     thyrocervical trunk, right costocervical trunk, and the non-embolized portion
     of the right lateral thoracic artery. The embolized portions of the right
     lateral thoracic artery demonstrated no flow. Arterial supply to the right
     upper lobe of the lung was demonstrated from branch of the right internal
     mammary artery. The area of lung supplied as abnormal hypervascularity and

     internal mammary artery and its major branches. A proximal branch of the right
     internal mammary artery supplies the right upper lobe of the lung in an
     abnormal hypervascular area with arteriovenous shunting to the right upper
     pulmonary vein. This proximal branch of the right internal mammary artery was
     selected with the Tracker microcatheter. This was embolized with multiple

     arterial phase consistent with arteriovenous shunting within the lung. Supply
     to the right upper lobe of the lung is also visualized from a branch of the
     right internal mammary artery.
     
     The right lateral thoracic artery was then selected and arteriography
     performed. This demonstrated patency of this vessel with supply to a
     hypervascular area of the right upper lobe of the lung with early venous
     filling of the right upper pulmonary vein consistent with arteriovenous
     shunting. Based on the patient's history and the diagnostic arteriogram, it
     was determined that the patient would be a good candidate for and may benefit
     from embolization. A 3-French microcatheter was placed through the Berenstein
     catheter and used to select two branches of the lateral thoracic artery. These
     branches and a segment of the lateral thoracic artery itself were embolized
     with multiple microcoils.
     
     Right lateral thoracic arteriography performed post-embolization demonstrated
     cessation of flow to the right upper lobe of the lung. The non-embolized
     branches of this artery remained patent. Several arteriograms of the branch
     vessels of the right lateral thoracic artery were performed during the course
     of the embolization to confirm which branches of the vessel required
     embolization and to test the success of embolization. Two branches of the
     lateral thoracic artery were selected.
     
     The microcatheter was removed and the Berenstein catheter was retracted into
     the right subclavian artery and right subclavian arteriography was performed.
     This demonstrated patency of the right subclavian artery, right internal
     mammary artery, visualized portion of the right vertebral artery, right
     thyrocervical trunk, right costocervical trunk, and the non-embolized portion
     of the right lateral thoracic artery. The embolized portions of the right
     lateral thoracic artery demonstrated no flow. Arterial supply to the right
     upper lobe of the lung was demonstrated from branch of the right internal
     mammary artery. The area of lung supplied as abnormal hypervascularity and
     arteriovenous shunting to the right upper pulmonary vein is demonstrated from
     this region.
     
     The right internal mammary artery was selected with the Berenstein catheter
     and arteriography was performed. This demonstrated patency of the right
     internal mammary artery and its major branches. A proximal branch of the right
     internal mammary artery supplies the right upper lobe of the lung in an
     abnormal hypervascular area with arteriovenous shunting to the right upper
     pulmonary vein. This proximal branch of the right internal mammary artery was
     selected with the Tracker microcatheter. This was embolized with multiple
     microcoils. Arteriography in this vessel was performed demonstrating cessation
     of flow in the embolized areas with some flow through the more proximal coils.
                                                                 (Over)

     As such, further coil embolization was undertaken in addition to embolization
     with a total of 1 ml of absolute alcohol given in two divided doses of 0.5 ml
     each. The microcatheter was then removed and right internal mammary
     arteriography was performed through the Berenstein catheter. This demonstrated
     complete cessation of flow through the proximal branch that had previously
     been supplying the right upper lobe of the lung. Remainder of the right
     internal mammary artery and its major branches remain patent. However, now at
     least two other branches of the right internal mammary artery demonstrate
     arterial supply to abnormal hypervascular areas of the right upper lobe of the
     lung. These were not demonstrated on the earlier (pre-embolization) right
     internal mammary arteriogram. This suggests that embolization of one arterial
     branch leads to recruitment of other arterial branches to the right upper
     lobe.
     
     At this stage, the Berenstein catheter was retracted into the right subclavian
     artery and right subclavian arteriography was performed. This demonstrated
     patency of the right subclavian artery, right internal mammary artery,
     visualized portion of the right vertebral artery, right paracervical trunk,
     right costocervical trunk, and non-embolized portions of the right lateral
     thoracic artery. No flow is seen through the embolized arteries. Arterial
     blood supply to the right upper lobe of the lung is seen from branches of the
     right internal mammary artery. No other definite arterial supply to the right
     upper lobe of the lung is demonstrated from the right subclavian artery or its
     branches.
     
     The Berenstein catheter was then exchanged over the guidewire for a pigtail
     catheter which was positioned in the proximal descending thoracic aorta.
     Descending thoracic aortography was performed. This demonstrated that the
     arterial supply to the right upper lobe of the lung from the aorta that had
     been previously embolized remained patent proximally, but no hypervascular
     lung was demonstrated. This would be consistent with the parenchymal level
     particle embolization that was previously performed.
     
     The case was then discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8318**] (Pneumology). Based on
     these discussions and the findings of the arteriogram (in particular, the
     finding that embolization of one arterial supply to the right upper lobe leads
     to the development/visualization of other new arterial supplies to the right
     upper lobe), it was determined that further embolization may not be of use.
     
     All wires, catheters and the sheath were removed. Hemostasis was ensured with
     direct manual compression. There were no immediate complications.
     
     MEDICATIONS: Total of 10 cc of 1% lidocaine subcutaneously was used for local
     anesthetic in the right inguinal region. A total of 345 cc of Optiray 320
     intra-arterial radiographic contrast was utilized.

     supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: Following written informed consent from the patient's
     wife, the patient was positioned supine on the angiography table. Preprocedure
     timeout was performed to confirm patient, procedure, and site. Standard
     sterile prep and drape of the right inguinal region. Using palpatory and
     fluoroscopic guidance, a single wall puncture of the right common femoral
     artery was performed with a 19-gauge needle. A 0.035-inch guidewire was passed
     through the needle into the abdominal aorta using fluoroscopic guidance. The
     needle was exchanged for a 5-French vascular sheath, which was attached to a
     continuous heparinized saline flush. A Berenstein catheter was used to select
     the right subclavian artery.

     RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND:  Grayscale and Doppler sonograms of the
     right common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed.
     The common and superficial femoral veins demonstrate normal flow,
     augmentation, compressibility, and waveforms.  The right popliteal vein
     demonstrates lack of normal flow and compressibility, and there is echogenic
     material within the lumen consistent with thrombus.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Deep venous thrombosis of the right popliteal vein.
     
     LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND:  Grayscale and Doppler sonograms of the left
     common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed.
     Normal flow, augmentation, compressibility, and waveforms are demonstrated.
     Intraluminal thrombus is not identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left lower
     extremity.
