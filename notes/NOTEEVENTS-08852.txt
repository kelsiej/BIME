Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs
 
Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4245**] 
Chief Complaint:
hyponatremia, decreased mental status
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Peripherally inserted central catheter
 
History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F with H/o hypothyroid  presents after fall.  Recently 
admitted for fall and pain control on [**Date range (1) 12344**], noted to have 
low Na (129) at the time, she then returned with altered mental 
status in setting of hyponatremia (112).  Initially attempted 
correction with normal saline, but she became volume overloaded 
w/ pulmonary edema [**3-2**] diastolic dysfunction.  Then, attempted 
diuresis caused bradycardia and hypotension.  She was 
transferred to MICU for further stabilization, and did well 
subsequently with minimal intervention - fluid restriction and 
small amount of hypertonic saline, which was discontinued.  She 
was then transferred to the floor for further titration of pain 
regimen and treatment of L1 fracture.
<BR>
On evaluation of her back, an MR of the L-Spine revealed acute 
compression fracture of L1 vertebra with retropulsion and 50% 
narrowing of central portion of the spinal canal, moderate 
spinal stenosis at L4-5 level due to disc and facet degenerative 
changes. Moderate-to-severe left foraminal stenosis at L5-S1 
level secondary to disc degenerative changes and facet 
degeneration.
<BR>
Pt was initially placed on a fentanyl patch (25mcg) in MICU for 
pain control.
<BR>
On transfer, pt was denying any pain, chest discomfort or 
shortness of breath

MR L SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2530-10-14**] 12:11 PM
Acute compression fracture of L1 vertebra with retropulsion and 
50% narrowing of central portion of the spinal canal. Moderate 
spinal stenosis at L4-5 level due to disc and facet degenerative 
changes. Moderate- to-severe left foraminal stenosis at L5-S1 
level secondary to disc degenerative changes and facet 
degeneration.

ECHO Study Date of [**2530-10-14**]   
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is 
markedly dilated.  
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left 
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left 
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the 
severity of valvular regurgitation.] Tissue velocity imaging 
E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular 
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).  
3.While difficult to assess, the right ventricular cavity is 
probably mildly dilated. Right ventricular systolic function 
appears depressed.  
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a 
minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic 
valve stenosis. Mild to  
moderate ([**1-30**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.  
5. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Moderate 
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.  
6. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.  
7.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  
8. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.  
9.There is no pericardial effusion.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
91F Mitral regurg, probable diastolic dysfunction intially 
admitted with delirium probably secondary to hyponatremia, poor 
PO intake, and severe pain [**3-2**] L1 compression fracture.  In 
detail:

1. Hyponatremia: Pt. initially presented with Na of 112.  She 
was given NS which precipitated volume overload and pulmonary 
edema secondary to diastolic dysfunction and mitral 
regurgitation. She subsequently had an episode of hypotension 
[**3-2**] overdiuresis and was transferred to the ICU.  Volume was 
allowed to reequilibrate, and the patient's sodium improved with 
fluid restriction and a small amount of hypertonic saline.  This 
was therefore thought to be as a result of combination SIADH as 
well as hypovolemic hyponatremia.

2. Compression fracture: An MRI showed a compression fracture of 
the L1 vertebra with retropulsion and 50% narrowing of central 
portion of the spinal canal, moderate spinal stenosis at L4-5 
level due to disc and facet degenerative changes. She may be a 
candidate for future kyphoplasty.  For the time being she has 
been fitted with a TLSO brace. Her pain regimen was tailored 
during her stay. Pt. was able to ambulate with PT.

3. Falls: We reduced the patients narcotics dose and she was 
evaluated by PT.  She continued her rehabilitation at the [**Hospital1 67**] 
House.

4. Heart failure: The patient's pulmonary edema is resolving.  
Her ECHO reveals a   EF55% 2+TR, 2+MR, RV depressed, Pulm 
Regurg, mod PA HTN. <BR>. She was started on Lisinopril and 
continued on her metoprolol and ASA.

5. Pain Control: for the patient's compression fracture, Mrs. [**Doctor First Name 12345**] pain was controlled with a Lidocaine patch, oxycodone 
sustained release 10mg q12, OxycodONE liquid 2.5 mg PO Q4H:PRN 
pain.  We stopped her fentanyl patch (25mcg) as it caused the 
patient to become confused.  Narcotics should be used very 
carefully in this patient as she tends to become confused and is 
susceptible to falls.  

6. ? Pneumonia: As pt became hypoxic in the setting of mental 
status changes shortly after admission, she was treated 
empirically with a course of levofloxacin.  However, she was 
never febrile and did not produce sputum, so antibiotics were 
discontinued at the time of discharge.

Nursing Progress Note:

Neuro: Pt. was oriented, pleasant, and cooperative at beginning of shift. Pt. was comfortable with Lidoderm patch, Fentanyl 25mcg patch applied. Pt. remained alert and conversant after patch applied. She slept well through the night and insisted on sleeping on her L side as she does at home. She turned well at the beginning of the shift but when turning her to remove Lidoderm patch she said that she was in a lot of pain and to put her back and not move her. Pt. fell back asleep and was not moved again as it appears that she needs her pain needs reassessed when more awake.

CV: HR 50s-60s NSR with  no ectopy, NBP 100s-120s/40s-50s. Pt. has double-lumen PICC which is patent and draws well. Sodium is now 140.

Resp: RR teens, 02 sats >97% on 2 L NC. Pt. has crackles throughout lungs, team is aware and wanted pt. monitored for resp distress, falling sats, and tachycardia before intervening. No worsening of resp status during night.

GI: Pt. ate small amounts of food and drank juice. BSX4, no BM on shift.

GU: Pt. autodiuresing during the night and is now 1500cc negative for the day.

Skin: Intact

Social: Family in to see pt. and reassured that pt. was improving.
