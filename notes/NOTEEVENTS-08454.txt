Admission Date:  [**3437-1-28**]     Discharge Date:  [**3437-1-30**]

Date of Birth:   [**3384-3-3**]     Sex:  F

Service:  NEUROSURGERY

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 53-year-old
woman who was well until she suddenly developed an abrupt
onset of headache and fell to the ground.  She was taken to
[**Hospital 51**] Hospital Emergency Room where a CT scan showed a 5
cm left deep basal ganglionic hypertensive hemorrhage.

The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital6 2460**] for further evaluation.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA: On laboratory examination, she
had no evidence of coagulopathy.

Her CT scan showed the huge hypertensive basal ganglionic
hemorrhage.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**3437-1-28**].  Due to the massive size of her hypertensive basal
ganglionic hemorrhage, her prognosis was felt to be very
poor.  Her coagulations were followed and euvolemia was
maintained.  Her blood pressure was controlled on Nipride.
After discussing her extremely poor prognosis with the
family, they understood and the patient was given comfort
measures.

She then progressed to brain death over the next two days and
was declared brain dead after an apnea test on [**3437-1-30**].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Death.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Death.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Hypertensive basal ganglionic
hemorrhage.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:   None.

FOLLOW-UP:  None.

      reevaluation of basal gangial bleed
     No contraindications for IV contrast

     WET READ: EEZ SAT [**3437-1-28**] 9:11 PM
      large intraparenchymal hemorrhage with subfalcine herniation (midline shift),
      small subarachnoid blood.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     INDICATION: Re-evaluation of basal ganglial bleed. Patient has films from
     outside hospital which are not immediately available for comparison.
     
     COMPARISON: No prior head CT from this institution are available for
     comparison.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Axial images of the head were acquired with IV contrast.
     
     NONCONTRAST HEAD CT: There is a large area of intraparenchymal hemorrhage
     originating near the left basal ganglia.  The blood extends into the
     ventricular system. There is greater than 1 cm of subfalcine herniation. There
     is dilation of the lateral ventricles, indicating hydrocephalus.  Blood is
     also present in the 3rd ventricle. There is a small punctate area of increased
     attenuation in the left parietal region, which may indicate small amount of
     subarachnoid blood. There is no evidence for transtentorial herniation.
     
     No fractures are seen.  The soft tissues are unremarkable.  Minimal mucosal
     thickening is present in the ethmoid air cells and left sphenoid sinus.
     
     IMPRESSION: Large intraparenchymal hemorrhage with intraventricular extension,
     and subfalcine herniation.  Possible subarachnoid bleed.
     If the patient has history of hypertension, this may be secondary to
     hypertensive bleed. IF the patient has no history of hypertension, ruptured
     left middle cerebral artery aneurysm, sometimes may have this kind of
     presentation.

     CLINICAL INDICATION:  SG catheter placement.
     
     A SG catheter terminates in the left pulmonary artery.  An ET tube is in
     satisfactory position.
     
     The heart is upper limits of normal in size for technique. The aorta is
     tortuous.  There is a moderate-sized right pleural effusion, which appears
     partially loculated within fissures.  There is also volume loss in the right
     hemithorax with shift of the mediastinum towards the right and inferior
     displacement of the minor fissure.
     
     The right hemidiaphragm is also slightly elevated.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. SG catheter in satisfactory position with no pneumothorax.
     
     2. Moderate-sized right pleural effusion.
     
     3. Increased opacity in right mid and lower lung zones with associated volume
     loss, suggestive of atelectasis. The chronicity of this process is uncertain.
