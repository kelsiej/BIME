     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      63 year old man with above history.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      63 y/o male with known plasma cell myeloma, c/o bilateral leg pain with
      walking. Would like to r/o spinal involvement/mass.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     MRI LUMBAR SPINE:
     
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with known plasmocytoma and bilateral lower
     extremity pain and weakness.  For further evaluation.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  T1, T2, and IR sagittal and T1 and T2 axial images of the lumbar
     spine were obtained before Gadolinium.  T1 sagittal and axial images were
     obtained following Gadolinium.
     
     There are no prior similar examinations for comparison.
     
     FINDINGS:  The visualized vertebral bodies from T9 to L5 and sacrum
     demonstrate diffuse decreased signal on T1W images with mild heterogeneous
     increased signal on IR images indicative of marrow infiltration.  The T11
     vertebra demonstrate pathologic fracture with soft tissue mass in the left
     paraspinal region.  Mild epidural soft tissue changes are seen on the sagittal
     images without evidence of high grade thecal sac compression or spinal cord
     compression.  Mild pathologic compression of L2 vertebra is identified.
     
     At L5 level soft tissue changes are seen within the posterior aspect of the
     vertebral bodies at L4 and L5 level with high grade compression of the thecal
     sac due to epidural soft tissue disease.  Mild Grade I spondylolisthesis of L4
     over L5 is identified.  Signal abnormalities within the posterior aspect of L5
     vertebral body indicate focal myeloma deposits.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Diffuse marrow signal abnormalities indicative of new infiltration.
     2) Focal marrow abnormalities with soft tissue mass on the left side at T11
     level with mild epidural disease at T11 level.  3) Mild pathologic compression
     fractures of T11, T12 and L2.  4) Focal myeloma deposits in the posterior
     portion of L5 vertebra with epidural soft tissue changes from L5 to superior
     aspect of S1 with high grade thecal sac compression.  The findings were
     discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10354**] at the time of interpretation of this study on
     [**3410-7-22**] at 6 P.M.

     FINDINGS:  AP supine view is compared to PA and lateral views of 6/18. The
     newly placed endotracheal tube terminates 25 mm above the carina.  The heart
     remains enlarged.  There is mild congestive heart failure.  The mediastinum is
     within normal limits for supine view.  A right pleural effusion is present.
     The left costophrenic angle is not included on the study, and a left effusion
     cannot be ruled out.  There is a left lower lobe opacity consistent with
     atelectasis.  The osseous structures are unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Satisfactory position of endotracheal tube.
     2) Congestive heart failure and right pleural effusion.
     3) Left lower lobe atelectasis.

     COMPARISON:  [**3410-5-29**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There are bilateral subdural fluid collections, new since the prior
     study.  Mostly the collections are of low attenuation, however there are
     multiple areas of high attenuation indicating acute blood products. A thin
     right parafalcian hematoma is also present and ther is blood along the right
     tentorium.  There are no areas of parenchymal hemorrhage.  The underlying
     sulci are slightly narrowed. The ventricles are not dilated. There is slight
     displacment of the anterior midline structures to the right since the left
     subdural collection is larger than the right, but there is no downward
     displacement of the brain. There are no areas where there has been loss of the
     [**Doctor Last Name 30**]/white matter differentiation.
     
     Sphenoid fluid is seen which may indicate sinusitis.
     There are lytic foci in the skull./
     
     IMPRESSION:  Interval development of acute and subacute bilateral subdural
     hematomas with mild mass effect.  There are no areas of intra-axial
     hemorrhage. There are no signs of infarction.  There may be sphenoid
     sinusitis.
