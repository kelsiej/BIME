Admission Date:  [**2660-2-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2660-3-1**]

Date of Birth:   [**2588-10-22**]       Sex:  F

Service:

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old
woman who presents to an outside hospital status post a fall,
transferred for evaluation of a subdural hematoma.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a past medical history
of breast cancer times 22 years with metastasis to the liver,
bone, and the GI system.  She is status post a right
mastectomy.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient reports feeling more tired
than usual a few days prior to the fall.  She was at home in
bed and remembers getting up out of bed to the bathroom,
unsure if sitting on the bed or walking. No symptoms prior to
the fall.  No dizziness.  No headache, chest pain, or
shortness of breath.  The next thing she remembers is that
she had fallen with loss of consciousness and found by her
husband.  The patient noted some dizziness a few days prior
to a fall.  She described the room spinning.  Possibly she
had weakness in her legs.

STUDIES:  A head CT showed bilateral acute subdural
hematomas, right greater than left and with a ribbon of
subarachnoid hemorrhage on the right side.

LABORATORY DATA FROM THE OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  INR 1.2.
Hematocrit 29.9, platelets 105,000.  Sodium 127, K 4.2,
chloride 97, C02 21, BUN 29, creatinine 1.1.  The patient was
admitted to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit for close
monitoring.  A Medicine consultation was obtained secondary
to a history of syncope.  It was felt that it was most likely
related to dehydration and also a low sodium.  The patient's
baseline sodium of 131-133.  It was 127 on admission.  The
medical recommendation was to keep the patient on telemetry
for 48 hours which was done.  There were no episodes of any
cardiac events in that 48 hour period.

Therefore, telemetry was discontinued and the patient was
transferred to the floor.  She was awake, alert, and oriented
times three, moving all extremities with good strength with
slight left-sided drift.  The patient was monitored in the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit for 48 hours and then
transferred to the regular floor.

She was seen by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy and
found to require rehabilitation.  Discussion with her primary
care physician recommended transfer to [**Location (un) **]
Rehabilitation where he could monitor her.  A Cortisol level
was sent to check for addisonism as possible cause for
hyponatremia.  The results are still pending.  The hematocrit
on [**2660-3-1**] was 25.7.  The patient was transfused with 1 unit
of packed cells.  The vital signs otherwise have been stable.
The patient has been neurologically intact with a slight left
drift and ecchymosis of the left eye.

CONDITION AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Calcium carbonate 1,000 mg p.o. q.i.d.
2.  Lactulose 30 cc p.o. q. six hours p.r.n.
3.  Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q. four hours p.r.n.
4.  Spironolactone 25 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.
6.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q. 24 hours.

     INDICATION:  71 y/o female status post fall with subdural and subarachnoid
     hemorrhages. Evaluate for interval change.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT of the brain without IV contrast.
     
     Comparison is made to prior exam from one day earlier.
     
     FINDINGS:  There has been no significant interval change in the appearance of
     the patient's brain. Once again, there is a moderate sized right
     frontoparietal subdural hematoma which is stable in size.  It is associated
     with mild mass effect and effacement of the adjacent sulci. Also noted are a
     small right parafalcine and small left frontal subdural hematoma, both of
     which are unchanged in the interval. There is a minimal amount of subarachnoid
     blood which appears stable in the interval.  The ventricles and cisterns are
     not effaced. The [**Doctor Last Name 30**]-white matter differentiation is grossly preserved. There
     is no shift of normally midline structures.
     
     The visualized osseous structures and paranasal sinuses are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of bilateral frontal subdural hematomas and
     small subarachnoid hemorrhage as described above.
