     FDG TUMOR IMAGING (PET-CT)                                      Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 7156**]
     Reason: Gastroesophageal cancer adenocarcinoma now status post 2 cycles of Xeloda therapy
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA:
        22.0 mCi F-18 FDG ([**2948-3-1**]);
     INDICATION: Gastroesophageal cancer adenocarcinoma now status post 2 cycles of 
     Xeloda therapy. 
      
     METHODS: Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration of F-18
     fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), noncontrast CT images were obtained for attenuation
     correction and for fusion with emission PET images. [The noncontrast CT images
     are not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.]  A series of
     overlapping emission PET images was then obtained. The fasting blood glucose
     level, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was 108 mg/dL. The area
     imaged spanned the region from the lower head to the upper thighs. 
      
     Computed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused with emission PET
     images to assist with the anatomic localization of tracer uptake.  The
     determination of the site of tracer uptake seen on PET data can have important
     implications regarding the significance of that uptake.  
      
     INTERPRETATION: 
     CHEST: There is a new small FDG avid left supraclavicular node with max SUV of
     6.3. There is a new small FDG avid paraesophageal node at the level of the high
     left atrium with max SUV of 10.  Multiple sub centimeter pulmonary nodules are
     not significantly changed in size allowing for differences in technique. These
     nodes are not FDG avid, but are too small to characterize with PET.  
       
     ABDOMEN/PELVIS: Thickening of the region of the distal esophagus and proximal
     stomach is again noted with increased FDG avidity compared to [**2948-1-9**] (max SUV
     34.7 previously 26). There are enlarged numerous small, confluent gastrohepatic
     ligament nodes with markedly increased FDG avidity with max SUV of 20.5.
     Confluent periportal lymph nodes have greater avidity with max SUV of 36.6,
     previoulsy 6.7. There is new fullness of the pancreas with associated increased
     FDG uptake in the area immediately adjacent to portion of the stomach involved
     with tumor suggestive of direct extension of tumor. Multiple paraaortic nodes
     are also increasingly FDG avid. There is rim-like increased FDG avidity anterior
     to the liver (max SUV 8.9) and at the anterior peritoneal surface in the left
     upper quadrant (max SUV 11.8). 
      
     There is new marked focal FDG avidity at the umbilicus corresponding to a small
     fat-containing hernia of uncertain significance.  
       
     BONE: There is decreased FDG avidity of the T8 vertebral body compared to the
     prior study.  
      
     Physiologic uptake is seen in the musculature, brain, GI tract, and [**Hospital Unit Name 755**] tract.  
        
     IMPRESSION:  Considerable interval progression of disease with new avid left
     supraclavicular and paraesophageal nodes and increased avidity of
                                                                 (Over)

     Additionally, there is new fullness of the pancreas with associated FDG avidity
     concerning for direct spread of tumor from the stomach. The T8 vertebra body is
     the only site of improvement.

     STUDY:  CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast.
     
     INDICATION:  63-year-old male with esophageal cancer, now with periumbilical
     pain and elevated lipase, evaluate for pancreatitis.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images were obtained from the lung bases to the pubic
     symphysis with IV contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were
     obtained.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  Within the right posterior lower lobe, there is
     a noncalcified pulmonary nodule measuring 1.1 cm x 0.7 cm, not mentioned on
     previous PET scan and is worrisome for metastatic disease.  No other nodules,
     opacity or effusion identified.
     
     At approximately the gastroesophageal junction, there is a soft tissue mass
     within the esophagus which measures approximately 2.8 cm x 2.2 cm, causing
     marked luminal narrowing.  The heart is normal in appearance without
     pericardial effusion.  The liver is normal in appearance without lesions
     identified.  The gallbladder is distended without wall thickening or
     pericholecystic fluid which may be consistent with a fasting state.  The body
     and tail of the pancreas are diffusely swollen with ill-defined margins and
     adjacent mesenteric fat stranding consistent with acute pancreatitis.  Low
     density ill-defined region within the neck and uncinate process of the
     pancreas may be consistent with metastatic disease.  No pancreatic duct
     dilatation identified or ductal stone visualized.  The adrenal glands, right
     kidney, ureters and small and large bowel are unremarkable.  There is a 2 cm
     in diameter simple cyst in the inferior pole of the left kidney.  The left
     kidney is otherwise unremarkable.  No free fluid or free air identified within
     the abdomen.  There is a small fat-filled ventral hernia at the umbilicus.
     Multiple enlarged paraortic nodes are identified, the largest measuring 1.3 cm
     in small dimension.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Calcification is seen within the prostate gland.
     The rectum, the sigmoid colon, unopacified small bowel pelvic loops and
     bladder are visualized and unremarkable.  A small amount of pelvic free fluid
     is identified.  No inguinal lymphadenopathy present.  
     
     OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  Degenerative changes are noted in the lower lumbar facet
     joints.  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions identified.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10850**] 
Chief Complaint:
coffee ground emesis 
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD with stent removal and placement of two new esophageal 
stents
 
History of Present Illness:
 Pt is a 63 YO M with progressive esophageal cancer on xeloda 
who was admitted to [**Hospital1 83**] from [**Date range (1) 11597**] for dysphagia w/course 
notable for distal esophageal stent placement by the ERCP team. 
On the day of discharge, he developed nausea with emesis, and 
vomited twice with dark blood. His wife called the floor and was 
told to call 911 and come to [**Hospital1 83**], but he initially went to an 
OSH and was found to have a HCT of 27. He vomited a third time, 
very small amount when there, which was considered coffee 
grounds. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 83**] and had a hct of 22 on 
presentation. He was admitted to the MICU for concern for an 
upper GI bleed from his cancer.  
.  
In the ED, he was given Protonix 40 IV once and crossmatched for 
blood. GI was contacted and suggested probably scope in the AM. 
He was admitted to the MICU for possible scope tomorrow.  
.  
ROS: He complains of some abdominal pain which is persistent for 
months. He has some shortness of breath at rest. He denies chest 
pain. He had vomiting but no nausea currently. He has not 
vomited since admission. He is not a forthcoming historian.  

 
Past Medical History:
1. Esophageal cancer, diagnsoed [**6-12**]. Advanced unresectable 
stage.  Started Irenotecan/Cisplatin [**7-12**] now on cycle 4. Last 
dose 12/28. 
2. Hypercholesterolemia  
3. Depression  
4. Anxiety  
5. BPH  

 
Social History:

Gen: No apparent distress, with long pauses between questions 
and answers  
HEENT: PERRLA, OP clear, MMM  
Resp: CTA bilaterally  
CV: RRR nl s1s2 no MGR  
Abd: soft, slight TTP diffusely across abdomen, no 
rebound/guarding  
Ext: no edema  
Neuro: A+O to [**Hospital1 83**], [**2948-3-7**] (but not date), with slow 
responses  

 
Pertinent Results:
CXR on [**2948-3-13**]:
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary disease.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis on [**2948-3-14**]:
IMPRESSION: 
  
1.  Mildly swollen ill-defined body and tail of the pancreas 
consistent with acute pancreatitis.  Low-attenuation enlarged 
periportal lymph[**MD Number 65**] 
consistent with metastatic involvement which appear to produce 
mass effect 
upon the pancreas. No pancreatic duct dilatation or ductal 
calcified stone 
identified. 
2.  Large heterogeneously enhancing lesion within the distal 
esophagus with luminal narrowing consistent with patient's known 
esophageal cancer. 
3.  Noncalcified pulmonary nodule within the right lung base 
measuring 1.1 cm, worrisome for metastatic disease. 
4.  Distended gallbladder without wall thickening or edema 
consistent with 
fasting state.   
5.  Small amount of free intrapelvic fluid. 
6.  Pathologically enlarged paraaortic and periportal lymph[**MD Number 510**] identified on recent PET-CT to show increased FDG avidity 
consistent with pathologic involvement. 

CT Head on [**2948-3-14**]:
IMPRESSION: 
1.  No evidence of hemorrhage or mass. 
2.  Asymmetrically positioned odontoid process, incompletely 
evaluated on 
current study.  This is likely positional but may be further 
evaluated with dedicated CT cervical spine if clinically 
indicated. 

EGD on [**2948-3-20**]:
Impression: 
Blood in the lower third of the esophagus
Mass in the lower third of the esophagus
Food in the stomach body

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Esophageal cancer:  Metastatic to liver and pancreas.  
Patient initially presented with dysphagia and required a stent. 
He initially had a lot of pain, but was eating well and was sent 
home. Patient returned to the hospital with coffee ground emesis 
and KUB showed that the stent migrated to his stomach. He 
required several units of blood and underwent second EGD and 
stent was retrieved and two additional esoph stents were placed. 
Unfortunately, 5 days after the last two stents were placed, the 
patient again started to vomit. CXR was obtained and again both 
stents migrated to the stomach. Given patient's condition, Dr. 
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and his family agreed that he should not under go another 
EGD for stent removal. He was placed on CMO and expired 4 am 
[**2948-4-4**].

2. Cholangitis:  Patient had elevated total bilirubin. This was 
thought to be due to progressive cancer and he was not thought 
to be candidate for stent. 

3. Mental status changes:  This was likely a combination of 
narcotics, elevated total bilirubin, anxiolytics. CT head 
negative.  

4. depression/anxiety/agitation:   Initially we continued celexa 
and risperidal. As the patient developed toxic metabolic 
confusion and was agitated and combative, we increased risperdal 
to 1 mg BID and used haldol.   

5. Hypercholesterolemia:  Discontinued lipitor when patient was 
made CMO.  

6. BPH:  Given initially and then discontinued when patient made 
CMO.

     HISTORY:  Esophageal stent, question migration.
     
     IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to [**3-20**].
     
     Esophageal stent is in the stomach.  Lungs are clear.  There is no pleural
     effusion or evidence of central adenopathy.  The heart is normal in size, and
     the mediastinum is midline.  There is no pneumomediastinum or appreciable
     mediastinal widening.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7168**], covering for Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 7169**], was paged to
     report these findings, at the time of dictation.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      63 year old man with esoph cancer and esoph stent that appears to have migrated 
      to stomach again 
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      eval for number of stents in stomach, had two placed by ercp in esoph           
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     Indication: Assessment for migrated metallic stents
     
     One supine radiograph of the abdomen was obtained.
     
     Comparison is made to prior study done on [**2948-3-20**] and CT of abdomen
     done on [**2948-3-14**].
     
     The previously seen metallic stent that was projecting over the stomach has
     been removed.  There is a new plastic stent measuring up to 12 cm projecting
     over the stomach.  Another stent that has three metallic rings is noted with
     its distal tip projecting over the stomach and its proximal tip projecting
     over gastroesophageal junction.  The stomach is severely dilated. The gas
     pattern of remainder of the bowel is normal.  Soft tissue markings are
     unremarkable.  Degenerative changes of lower lumbar spine are noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Status post removal of migrated metallic stent and placement of two new
     stents.  One stent is entirely in the stomach and the other stent has its
     proximal end at the gastroesophageal junction and the majority of it is seen
     in the stomach, this is concerning for stent migration.
     2.  Distended stomach.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  63-year-old man with esophageal cancer and stent placement, now
     with mental status changes.
     
     COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest x-ray dated [**2948-3-27**].
     
     AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY:  A right subclavian Port-A-Cath terminates in
     the mid SVC.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are within
     normal limits.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  There is mild
     linear atelectasis at bilateral lung bases, left greater than right.
     Atelectasis at the left lung base is likely related to a distended stomach but
     is filled with gas and fluid.  Metallic stent extends from the lower esophagus
     and to the proximal stomach.  There is no intrabdominal free air.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No pneumonia.
     2.  Bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right.
     3.  Slightly distended stomach filled with gas and fluid.  No intraabdominal
     free air.
