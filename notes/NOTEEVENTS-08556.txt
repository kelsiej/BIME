Admission Date:  [**2997-8-16**]       Discharge Date:  [**2997-9-13**]

Date of Birth:   [**2916-8-27**]       Sex:  M

Service:  Cardiothoracic Service

IDENTIFICATION/REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 11892**] is an
80-year-old gentleman who has complained of shortness of
breath and fatigue over the past four years; worsening over
the past year.

He is postoperative admission scheduled for a redo mitral
valve replacement with a tricuspid valve replacement via a
right thoracotomy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80-year-old gentleman
status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2981**] and a
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2993**] with
complaints of shortness of breath on exertion and fatigue
over the past four years which has worsened over the past
year, prompting the patient to finally consent to surgery
which he has been refusing for at least one year prior to
this surgical date.

The patient had a cardiac catheterization done on [**7-18**]
that showed left main disease with a patent right coronary
artery stent a left internal mammary artery to the left
anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the left
circumflex; both patent.  Severe mitral regurgitation and an
ejection fraction of 67%.  His echocardiogram done on [**7-13**]
showed right ventricular enlargement with moderate-to-severe
tricuspid regurgitation and moderate mitral regurgitation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Atrial fibrillation.
3.  Prostate cancer.
4.  Colon cancer.
5.  Pancytopenia.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Status post coronary artery bypass graft times two
in [**2981**].
2.  Status post colonoscopy in [**2993**].
3.  Status post colectomy in [**2991**].
4.  Status post radical prostatectomy in [**2992**].
5.  Status post penile implant.
6.  Status post right urethral stent.
7.  Status post bone marrow biopsy to diagnose pancytopenia
in [**2997-7-20**].

Coumadin 2 mg p.o. q.d., Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d., and
Vasotec 5 mg p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's family history revealed father
died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 59.  Mother
died of breast cancer at 48.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives alone in Lundinary, [**Location (un) 996**].
Positive tobacco use; four packs per day times 35 years; quit
about 35 years ago.  Social alcohol use; about 10 beers per
month.  He denies any other drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Physical examination
prior to admission revealed height was 5 feet 10 inches,
weight was 185 pounds, heart rate was 85 and irregular, blood
pressure was 106/62, respiratory rate was 24.  In general, a
pleasant male who appeared his stated age, in no acute
distress.  Skin was well hydrated.  Left cheek with a
half-dollar size lesion, purplish in color.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose, and throat revealed pupils were equally round and
reactive to light with extraocular movements intact.
Positive glasses.  Positive hearing aid.  Positive upper and
lower dentures.  Normal buccal mucosa.  The neck was supple.
No jugular venous distention.  No thyromegaly.  No
lymphadenopathy.  No carotid bruits.  Chest with positive
crackles at the right base.  A sternal incision was
well-healed.  The sternum was stable.  Heart was irregular,
second heart sound and second heart sound, with a positive
[**2-22**] murmur heard best at the apex.  Slightly distant heart
sounds.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.
Normal active bowel sounds with a median abdominal incision
that was well-healed.  A colostomy bag and the ileostomy bag
were both intact.  Diffuse bilateral varicosities; right
greater than left.  Neurologically, cranial nerves II through
XII were grossly intact.  A nonfocal examination.  Femoral
pulses were 2+ bilaterally.  Dorsalis pedis pulses were 2+ on
the right and 1+ on the left.  Posterior tibialis pulses were
not palpated.  Radial pulses were 2+ bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   On [**8-16**], the patient was a direct
admission to the operating room at which time he underwent a
beating heart mitral valve replacement with a #27 Mosaic
valve and a tricuspid valve repair with a 32-mm ring.

The patient tolerated the operation and was transferred from
the operating room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
At the time of transfer, the patient was in atrial
fibrillation at a rate of 100 with a central venous pressure
of 13, a mean arterial pressure was 67.  He had propofol at
30 mcg/kg per minute, and epinephrine at 0.3 mcg/kg per
minute.

The patient had an extended postoperative recovery in the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  He received large
amounts of volume during his surgical repair.  The first
several days of his Intensive Care Unit admission were spent
diuresing the patient in an attempt to get him successfully
extubated.  During that time, he remained hemodynamically
stable.  He was weaned from all cardioactive drugs.  He did,
however, have frequent episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation;
for which he was initially loaded with amiodarone and later
switched to digoxin for rate control.

During the surgical repair of the patient's mitral valve and
tricuspid valve repair, he received large amounts of fluid,
and the first several days of the Intensive Care Unit were
spent with the patient undergoing vigorous diuresis in an
attempt to successfully extubate him.

On postoperative day eight, an attempt was made to extubate
the patient.  He rapidly failed the attempted extubation a
reintubated within 60 minutes of his initial extubation.  The
patient again weaned to CPAP following reintubation and
remained in the Intensive Care Unit ventilatory dependent.

On [**8-30**], the patient underwent a percutaneous
tracheostomy and percutaneous gastric tube placement.  He had
a #8 percutaneous tracheostomy placed at the bedside.  The
patient tolerated that procedure well and remained in the
Intensive Care Unit for the next several days; again,
undergoing ventilatory wean and ramping up of the patient's
tube feeds.  He was noted to have a large right loculated
pleural effusion.

On [**9-5**], he underwent a right videoscopic
thoracoscopy for removal of his loculated right pleural
effusion.  From that time forward, the patient remained in
the Intensive Care Unit with attempts being made to wean the
patient from the ventilator and get him to tracheostomy
collar.  The patient did tolerate ventilatory wean to a
pressure support of 5 and 5 during the day, resting at night,
with increased amounts of pressure support (up to 15) or
intermittent mandatory volumes with a rate of 8 to 10 breaths
per minute.  During this period of time, the patient was also
restarted on his anticoagulation given his history of atrial
fibrillation.

The patient is now postoperative day 27 from his valvular
surgery and on postoperative day seven from his tracheostomy
and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube, and it was felt
that he was stable and ready to be transferred to
rehabilitation for continuing weaning from his ventilator.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  A review of the patient's
physical examination at this time is as follows;  temperature
was 99.8, heart rate was 100 in atrial fibrillation, blood
pressure was 129/50, respiratory rate was 20, oxygen
saturation was 100% (that was with pressure support of 10,
positive end-expiratory pressure of 5, and 40% FIO2).  His
tidal volume with those settings was a tidal volume of
between 450 and 500, and his respiratory ranges 20 to 25.
Neurologically, the patient was alert and oriented.  He
followed commands and moved all extremities.  He does have
periods of agitation, and he felt frustrated that he could
not eat or talk.  Cardiovascularly, he had a heart rate from
80 to 100, in atrial fibrillation.  Second heart sound and
second heart sound with no murmurs.  The patient had a
well-healed old sternal incision.  Respiratory revealed he
had a #8 Portex tracheostomy.  He remained on CPAP 40%, 5 of
positive end-expiratory pressure, 10 of pressure support,
oxygen saturations were 96% to 100%.  He had scattered
rhonchi throughout, and no rales.  Suctioned for thick tan
secretions.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended, with positive bowel sounds.  Tube feeds via his
gastrectomy tube at a goal rate.  He also had an intact
colostomy drainage bag.  He had an ileal loop that had a
collection bag that was intact, draining yellow urine with
some sediment in it.  Endocrine wise, the patient was
receiving sliding-scale insulin to cover blood sugars of
greater than 150.  He had a right thoracotomy with clean
margins, a small amount of sanguinous drainage from the upper
portion of that incision.

     INDICATION:  Status post mitral valve and tricuspid valve replacements.
     
     COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest dated [**2997-8-10**].
     
     AP CHEST:  The endotracheal tube is just below the thoracic inlet.  The left
     IJ Swan-Ganz catheter tip is in the main pulmonary artery.  Two new left-sided
     chest tubes extend medially; the superior chest tube ends adjacent to the lung
     apex.  A lucency at the right lung base could represent a loculated
     pneumothorax.  Overall increased density of the right hemithorax is probably
     due to layering pleural fluid.  A linear band of density at the right lung
     base is likely atelectasis; adjacent to this in the right mid lung is a more
     focal and rounded density which could represent consolidation.  Subcutaneous
     emphysema is seen along the right chest, adjacent to multiple superficial skin
     staples.  A lucency extends into the left costophrenic sulcus, possibly
     representing a deep sulcus sign and left pneumothorax.  There are no focal
     consolidations within the left lung.  The heart size is unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Right pleural fluid, of which blood may be a component.  Probable loculated
     right pneumothorax.  Some density within the left lung is likely atelectasis,
     but other areas of density could represent developing consolidation.
     
     2) Lucency at the left costophrenic sulcus may represent left pneumothorax, as
     well.  Findings were discussed with house staff at the time of the study.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Postoperative bleeding.
     
     The ET tube, two right sided chest tubes and swan ganz are unchanged in
     position. The end of the NG tube is not clearly identified.  There is an
     increasing parenchymal opacity in the entire right lung predominantly in the
     lower and middle lobe.  No apical pneumothorax is identified.  There is
     subcutaneous air along the right chest wall.  Again identified are the
     lucencies at overlying both hemidiaphragms.  It is unclear whether these are
     related to pneumothoraces.  There are surgical clips overlying the right
     posterior hemithorax with a rib resection.  There are sternal wires.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) There is increasing right sided parenchymal opacity and pleural
     effusion.  This may represent postoperative atelectasis but an aspiration
     event cannot be excluded.  2) The bilateral basilar lucencies are unchanged
     and may represent pneumothorax but is unlikely.  If there is clinical
     concern a decubitus view may be performed.

     Compared to previous study of earlier the same date.
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Status post recent valve surgery.
     
     Endotracheal tube, Swan-Ganz catheter, mediastinal drain, and two right-sided
     chest tubes remain in place.
     
     There is an enlarging right pleural effusion, and there is overall worsening
     aeration within the right lung.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are
     stable in the postoperative period, allowing for differences in technique.
     Minor atelectatic changes are observed in the left lower lobe.  The left
     costophrenic angle region is not completely imaged on the study and cannot be
     assessed.  Subcutaneous emphysema is seen in the right chest wall.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Worsening right pleural effusion, moderate to large in size.  Hemothorax
     should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
     
     2. Diffuse parenchymal opacity in the right lung, of uncertain etiology.
     Aspiration or hemorrhage should be considered in the appropriate clinical
     settings in this recently postoperative patient.
     
     3. Minor atelectasis in the left lower lobe.

     COMPARISON: [**2997-8-21**].
     
     SINGLE PORTABLE ERECT AP CHEST: This is a technically limited under penetrated
     study.  There is increased opacity of the right lung, caused by an enlarged
     effusion, which extends into the major fissure.  Additionally, again is noted,
     right-sided atelectasis with compression/collapse of the right lower lobe and
     middle lobe.  There is marked cardiac enlargement without vascular evidence of
     left heart failure.  The tip of the ET tube is 5 cm from the carina. There is
     a left-sided IJ sheath.  There is a tubular object overlying the right lung
     field which does not appear to correspond to any chest tubes or central lines.
      There are sternotomy wires present, and a thin ring overlying the base of the
     heart.  Has the person had a CABG?  There are no prosthetic valves visualized.
      There are right-sided skin staples present.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Increased right-sided pleural effusion with associated unchanged
     atelectasis.

     Chest.
     
     INDICATION:  Re-evaluate right chest tube placement.  Evaluate left triple-
     lumen catheter.  Patient is status post mitral valve and tricuspid valve
     replacement.  Diminished breath sounds.
     
     FINDINGS:  A single AP semi-upright chest image is provided.  Comparison study
     was taken three hours earlier.  The right chest tube is at the base of the
     right hemithorax, its tip pointing downward.  The left IJ triple-lumen
     catheter tip is difficult to define.  It appears to be at the proximal end of
     the left brachiocephalic vein, above the level of the aorta.  The endotracheal
     tube remains in good position.  The NG tube tip appears to be in the fundus of
     the stomach.  Marked cardiomegaly, mainly left ventricular, is again noted.
     Probable prosthetic tricuspid valve is visible but an associated mitral valve
     is not clearly identified.  There is again evidence of a fairly large right-
     sided pleural effusion with compression/collapse of the right lower lobe and
     partial collapse of the right middle lobe.  Surgical skin clips overlie the
     right upper thorax.
     
     IMPRESSION:  The right chest tube is in a basal position.  The left TLC tip
     appears to be in the brachiocephalic vein.  The cardiomegaly and right large
     pleural effusion are not significantly changed.

     INDICATION:  Chest tube placement, evaluation status post mitral valve and
     tricuspid valve replacement.
     
     INTERPRETATION:  AP portable upright chest radiograph of [**2997-8-23**] at 13:28
     compared to a portable AP chest radiograph of [**2997-8-23**] at 8:43.  Suboptimal
     film.  One prosthetic valve ring noted in location probably the tricuspid
     valve.  A second prosthetic valve is not identified on the present suboptimal
     film.  Standard PA and lateral chest radiographs recommended when clinically
     feasible.  The tip of the endotracheal tube is approximately 5 cm from the
     carina.  There is a left IJ introducer sheath in position with its tip
     overlying the aorta.  The NG tube is in good position with its tip in the
     stomach.  There is a small metal ring overlying the cardiac silhouette,
     probably a site of venous graft anastomosis.  The previously noted right upper
     zone chest tube has been removed.  There is a lower right chest tube.  There
     are right-sided skin staples present.  There is continued opacity of the right
     lung with associated right-sided effusion which appears unchanged compared to
     the prior chest radiograph.  There is cardiac enlargement without pulmonary
     vascular redistribution.  No pneumothorax identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax identified.  Right-sided pleural effusion with
     associated atelectasis, unchanged from prior chest radiograph.

     AP CHEST:  Technically suboptimal study as the left costophrenic angle is
     excluded.  In the interval since the prior study, three chest tubes have been
     placed on the right, two of which terminate in the region of the superior
     right hilum and the third turns inferiorly and terminates toward the base of
     the right lung. Associated subcutaneous air is noted. There is near-complete
     resolution of the right pleural effusion with improvement in right lower lobe
     atelectasis. There is increase in intersitial pattern of opacification
     overlying the right lung. The mediastinal and hilar contours as well as the
     cardiac contour are stable when compared to the prior study of [**2997-7-13**]. The
     patient is status post median sternotomy.  The endotracheal tube tip is well
     positioned in the mid- trachea.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Near-complete resolution right pleural effusion after the placement of
     three right-sided chest tubes.
     2.  Increase intersitial pattern of opacification on the right -- mild heart
     failure vs. early pneumoina can not be excluded.

     TECHNIQUE: Single AP portable view of the chest is compared with [**2997-9-5**].
     
     FINDINGS: Again seen is an unchanged tracheostomy, 3 right sided chest tubes
     (2 with the tips at the superior right apex, and 1 with the tip at the medial
     right lung base). There is a left sided subclavian central catheter, with the
     tip visualized to the SVC. There is left subcutaneous emphysema than on the
     prior study. There is a sub pleural parenchymal infiltrate of the right middle
     lobe laterally, which appears unchanged compared to the prior study. There
     appears to be slight improvement of the left basilar air space process, with
     slight worsening of the right basilar process. There is no other significant
     changes. There is enlargement of the heart, with no evidence of failure. There
     are multiple cardiac clips, and sternotomy wires present. The tricuspid valve
     replacement is noted. The mitral valve cannot be identified. There is a round
     radiopaque marker overlying the mid thoracic spine. The left costophrenic
     angle is not visualized on this study.
     
     IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of right effusion. There is slight worsening
     of atelectatic changes at the right base, with slight improvement at the left
     base. Additionally, there is a stable lateral right middle lobe sub pleural
     infiltrate.

I explained to him that he was still in the hospital, in an intensive care unit after he had open heart surgery and he was in a room in that unit, with a bed and chair and a window. He seemed to understand. We talked about him going to Rehab. He said that he had been thru to much. I explained to him that at rehab they would probably be able to make it so that he could speak, he seemed very interested in doing that. I again explained that the only reason that he could not speak at this time was due to the trach, and once he was a little stronger he could speak with it in.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: 83-year-old man status post mitral valve and tricuspid valve
     replacement.
     
     COMPARISONS: [**2997-9-8**].
     
     FINDINGS: Median sternotomy wires and an artificial valve with are identified.
      There is a tracheostomy tube in satisfactory position.  The patient is status
     post thoracotomy and is missing a portion of his fourth right rib. Compared to
     the prior study, there has been an increase in the opacification seen in the
     right lower lung base.  There is also a right-sided pleural effusion. On the
     left side, there has been interval development of an opacification. There is
     mild blunting of the left costophrenic angle consistent with a small pleural
     effusion. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged and there is mild blurring of the
     pulmonary vasculature.
     
     IMPRESSION: There are bilateral lower lobe opacities, greater on the right
     than the left, which have increased compared to the prior study.
     
     Status post thoracotomy.
     
     Bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right than the left.
     
     There is cardiomegaly with mild interstitial edema.

     CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST [**2997-9-17**].
     
     INDICATION:  Pneumonia, possible empyema.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired CT images are obtained from the neck to the
     diaphragms.  100 cc Optiray nonionic contrast was administered given patient's
     cardiac history.
     
     Comparison to [**2997-9-2**].
     
     CT CHEST AFTER IV CONTRAST:  There is no axillary adenopathy.  Small
     medistinal nodes are present, some with fatty centers.  Stranding is seen in
     the anterior mediastinum, anterior to the SVC, stable from the prior study.
     There is cardiomegaly, including left atrial enlargement.  The patient has
     prosthetic mitral and tricuspid valves.  CABG vascular clips and median
     sternotomy wires are seen. There is no pericardial effusion. There is
     calcification of the tracheal- bronchial tree.  There are bilateral pleural
     fluid collections, right greater than left.  The righ fluid collection has
     enhancing margins and empyema cannot be excluded.  A smaller loculated fluid
     collection without enhancing borders is located medially within the right
     lung. The left-sided pleural effusion tracks into the major fissure. There is
     atelectasis and near- complete collapse of the left lower lobe.  There is
     near- complete consolidation of the right lower lobe, lateral segment of the
     right middle lobe, and posterior segment of the right upper lobe. Compared to
     the prior study, the right-sided effusion/empyema is smaller but the areas of
     consolidation have increased. Multiple small nodules are seen within the
     expanded portions of both lungs.
     
     Note is made of a tracheostomy.  Note is also made of a percutaneous G tube.
     Gallstones are seen within a nondistended nonthickened gallbladder.
     Atherosclerotic changes are seen along the abdominal aorta.  Views of the
     liver, spleen, pancreas, and part of the left kidney are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Large right sided pneumonia.  Bilateral fluid collections, left greater
     than right.  However, the right sided fluid collection has enhancing walls and

     and failure to wean. Evaluate pneumonia.
     
     AP BEDSIDE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Comparison is made to a prior study dated
     [**2997-10-10**]. There is a tracheostomy in good position. There are midline
     sternotomy wires and surgical clips noted within the mediastinum. There is
     evidence of resection of the 5th rib. The heart size is enlarged. The
     mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. There is no evidence of failure.
     There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle consistent with small right
     sided pleural effusion. There is focal area of opacity within the right upper
     lung zone which is decreased in comparison to the prior exam. There is slight
     increase in the right lower lobe atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. Soft
     tissues and osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION: Decreased opacity within the right upper lung zone suggesting
     resolving pneumonia in that region. Increased atelectasis at the right lung
     base.

     INDICATION:  Evaluate right pleural effusion.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired axial images were obtained through the chest
     using 5 mm collimation, and IV contrast.  Additional imaging through the lower
     lobes in right lateral decubitus position was also performed.
     
     CONTRAST:  100 cc of optiray was given due to debility.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2997-9-17**]
     
     CHEST CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a very small amount of residual pleural
     fluid on the right, which is decreased in size since the exam from September
     2002. There is continued evidence of pleural enhancement on either side of
     this fluid collection which can be seen in the setting of infected fluid. Much
     of this fluid is loculated.  A trace amount of pleural fluid remains on the
     left side, but this is significantly decreased since the previous study.
     
     There is evidence of retained secretions/mucoid impaction in the region of the
     bronchus intermedius extending toward the lower lobe bronchi.  There are air
     space opacities in the right lower lobe with associated volume loss.  In the
     setting of retained secretions in the bronchus intermedius, this likely
     represents atelectasis.  Since exam from 1 month ago, this is improved.
      In addition, the previously seen area of atelectasis in the left lower lobe
     has resolved.  There is mild diffuse centrilobular emphysema.
     
     There is moderate cardiomegaly.  The patient is S/P CABG.  No significantly
     enlarged mediastinal, axillary, or hilar lymph nodes are seen.  There is a
     tracheostomy tube in place.
     
     In the imaged portions of the upper abdomen, the liver, spleen, pancreas,
     adrenal glands, and upper pole of the left kidney are unremarkable.  There is
     a cyst at the upper pole of the right kidney.  Numerous gallstones are
     present.  There appears to be surgical fracture involving the right 6th rib
     posteriorly.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Very small amount of residual right-sided pleural fluid with
     evidence of loculation and enhancement of the pleura (split pleura sign),
     which can be seen with empyema. The left pleural effusion has nearly
     completely resolved with only a trace amount of pleural fluid remaining on the
     left.
                                                                 (Over)

     CONTRAST:  100 cc of optiray was given due to debility.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2997-9-17**]
     
     CHEST CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a very small amount of residual pleural
     fluid on the right, which is decreased in size since the exam from September
     2002. There is continued evidence of pleural enhancement on either side of
     this fluid collection which can be seen in the setting of infected fluid. Much
     of this fluid is loculated.  A trace amount of pleural fluid remains on the
     left side, but this is significantly decreased since the previous study.
     
     There is evidence of retained secretions/mucoid impaction in the region of the
     bronchus intermedius extending toward the lower lobe bronchi.  There are air
     space opacities in the right lower lobe with associated volume loss.  In the
     setting of retained secretions in the bronchus intermedius, this likely
     represents atelectasis.  Since exam from 1 month ago, this is improved.
      In addition, the previously seen area of atelectasis in the left lower lobe
     has resolved.  There is mild diffuse centrilobular emphysema.
     
     There is moderate cardiomegaly.  The patient is S/P CABG.  No significantly
     enlarged mediastinal, axillary, or hilar lymph nodes are seen.  There is a
     tracheostomy tube in place.
     
     In the imaged portions of the upper abdomen, the liver, spleen, pancreas,
     adrenal glands, and upper pole of the left kidney are unremarkable.  There is
     a cyst at the upper pole of the right kidney.  Numerous gallstones are
     present.  There appears to be surgical fracture involving the right 6th rib
     posteriorly.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Very small amount of residual right-sided pleural fluid with
     evidence of loculation and enhancement of the pleura (split pleura sign),
     which can be seen with empyema. The left pleural effusion has nearly
     completely resolved with only a trace amount of pleural fluid remaining on the
     left.
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION:  Tracheobronchitis, ? aspiration.
     
     VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW STUDY:
     
     Thin, nectar and pudding consistencies of barium, as well as a barium-coated
     cookie were administered to the patient.  In the left lateral position, under
     real-time fluorosocpic observation, the oral and pharyngeal stages of
     swallowing were videotaped.
     
     With all consistencies, there was piecemeal transport of the bolus during the
     oral phase.  During the pharyngeal phase there is absent epiglottic
     deflection.  During swallowing there is penetration into the laryngeal
     vestibule.  This gradually results in aspiration secondary to gravity.  The
     patient does not cough spontaneously with either laryngeal vestibule
     penetration or with aspiration.  The patient is able to clear on cue.  There
     is moderate retention of all consistencies in the vallecula and mild residual
     in the pyriform sinuses.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     The patient penetrates into the laryngeal vestibule, which ultimately results
     in aspiration.  The patient does not cough spontaneously, although is able to
     clear on cue.
