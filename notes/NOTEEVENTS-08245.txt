Admission Date:  [**3163-7-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**3163-8-1**]

Date of Birth:   [**3117-1-2**]     Sex:  M

Service:  GOLD SURGERY

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
1.  Pancreatic mass.
2.  Subcapsular hepatic hematoma.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 46-year-old
male who presented to the hospital in the Birkshire
complaining of ten days of painless jaundice, six days of
dark-colored urine and ten days of pruritus.  An ERCP was
attempted at the outside hospital which was unsuccessful so
the patient's primary care physician transferred him to [**Hospital6 293**] where he underwent a second
ERCP which was also unsuccessful due to blood and coffee
grounds in the stomach and oozing at the major papilla and
edema.

On [**3163-7-23**], the patient was admitted to the hospital.  He
denied abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, or
unintentional weight loss.  He did admit to loose stools for
six days, although they remained normal in color.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  None.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy in [**3157**].
2.  Tonsillectomy.
3.  Nasal polypectomy.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol as needed at home.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a supreme court judge.  He is
married with three children.  He has an occasional beer or
glass of wine.  He does not use tobacco but did smoke two
cigarettes a day for five years.  He quit this four years
ago.

FAMILY HISTORY:  His maternal grandmother died of pancreatic
cancer in her 60s.  His mother died of lung cancer in her
70s.  His father died of a ruptured AAA in his 70s.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  The patient
was afebrile.  His vital signs were normal.  General:  He was
an obese, jaundiced, pleasant male in no apparent distress.
HEENT:  The patient had scleral icterus.  Heart:  Regular
rate and rhythm.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen:  Soft, obese, with scars from the laparoscopic
ports.  It was nondistended, nontender, no
hepatosplenomegaly.  No rebound or guarding.  He did have
petechiae secondary to itching.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**3163-7-23**]
to the hospital service upon which time Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
consulted for history of mass in the head of the pancreas
seen on outside hospital CT scan.  On admission, the patient
received a CT angiogram to demonstrate the nature of his
pancreatic mass.  He also went for percutaneous transhepatic
biliary drain placement on [**3163-7-24**].

On [**3163-7-25**], an MRI was done to determine the nature
of caudate lobe lesion.  Upon receiving the images, it was
discovered that the patient had a large subcapsular hematoma
of the liver along with a liver laceration and active
extravasation of contrast during the MRI.  The patient was
lightheaded but his vital signs were normal and stable.

He was emergently transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit at this time and angiography with embolization was
planned.  Subsequently, the angiography showed no signs of
hepatic arterial injury.  The patient was transfused with 4
units of FFP and 4 units of packed red blood cells at this
time.  At this time, he was transferred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Surgical Service and was monitored in the ICU with
serial hematocrits and arterial and central venous lines.

The patient's hematocrit fell as low as 24.8 at 10:00 p.m. on
[**3163-7-25**].  Serial hematocrits were monitored and the
patient's hematocrit was maintained above 30 from the morning
of [**3163-7-27**].

Hematology/Oncology was consulted on [**3163-7-26**] and recommended
further determination of the need for radiotherapy or
chemotherapy to be done after the time of surgery.  Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr.[**Location (un) 9877**] service continued to follow the
patient while he was in the Surgical ICU.  He remained stable
and no other events occurred in the SICU.

The patient was transferred to the floor on [**3163-7-29**]
to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] Surgical Service.  The patient was
continued on bed rest.  On [**3163-7-31**], the patient complained
of left knee pain beneath the patella so he was sent for
bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds which served to rule
out a DVT.  He also received plain films of the left knee
which showed mild arthritic changes.  The patient was
switched to p.o. levofloxacin on [**3163-7-30**].  His hematocrit
remained stable for the rest of the hospital stay.  His
biliary tube continued to drain bilious fluid.  The patient
was discharged on [**3163-8-1**].

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  The patient had an ERCP done on
[**3163-7-23**] which showed a moderate amount of blood and coffee
grounds in the stomach and active oozing at the major papilla
with unsuccessful attempts at cannulation of the biliary
duct.  Common bile duct brushing taken on [**3163-7-24**]
showed rare atypical single cells.  A CTA of the abdomen on
[**3163-7-24**] showed a 3.5 by 3.9 cm pancreatic mass
producing obstruction of the common bile duct and
intrahepatic bile ducts.  No adjacent vascular involvement,
local grade 1.  It also showed a 2.6 by 5 cm lesion in the
caudate lobe of the liver suggestive of either metastases
versus hemangioma.

The patient received an MRI of the abdomen on [**3163-7-25**] which
showed the caudate lobe lesion to be consistent with
hemangioma.  This also showed the known pancreatic mass as
well as a large subcapsular hematoma with active bleeding.

Angiography on [**3163-7-25**] showed no subhepatic arterial
injury.

The patient received another CT of the abdomen on [**3163-7-30**] which showed a large subcapsular right lobe hepatic
hematoma with extension into the liver parenchyma.  There
also was some compression of the right portal vein due to
mass affect from the intraparenchymal hematoma.  The
intrahepatic ductal dilatation resolved.  The percutaneous
catheter remained in place.  There was a development of a
large right-sided pleural effusion inconsistent with simple
pleural effusion.

Films of the left knee on [**3163-7-31**] showed mild degenerative
changes.  No other pathology was seen.

An ultrasound of the bilateral lower extremity veins showed
no evidence of DVT.

Pertinent laboratories during this admission include
hematocrit on admission of 40.5, subsequent drop in
hematocrit, as mentioned in the hospital course, and
hematocrit on [**3163-7-30**] of 30.5.

On admission, the patient's total bilirubin was around 24.
It was checked again on [**3163-7-28**] and was found to be 8.9.
His liver enzymes remained elevated throughout the hospital
stay, although they did decrease significantly.  On [**3163-7-28**],
his ALT was 395, AST 105, and alkaline phosphatase 247.  On
admission, ALT was 553, AST 292, alkaline phosphatase 465.
AFP measured on [**3163-7-25**] was 2.6.  CA19-9 measured at an
outside laboratory was 941.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS: To home with services for change of his
biliary drain.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Pancreatic mass in the head of the pancreas.
2.  Subcapsular liver hematoma.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Protonix 40 mg one tablet every day.
2.  Levofloxacin 500 mg one tablet every 24 hours until the
time of surgery.
3.  Percocet 5/325 one to two every four hours as needed for
pain.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to have a follow-up appointment on
[**3163-8-19**] at 11:30 with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. He is to go for
CT angiogram on [**3163-8-19**] at 10:15 before he visits
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and will follow the visit with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with
his preoperative visit with Anesthesia and for preoperative
laboratories.  The patient's surgery for the Whipple
procedure is scheduled for [**3163-8-27**].

     PHYSICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2410**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 815**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was present for the
     entire procedure.
     
     INDICATION:  A 46-year-old gentleman with pancreatic mass and biliary
     obstruction.  Unable to stent via ERCP x 2.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  MAC
     
     CONTRAST:  120 ml of 60% Conray.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6155**] was taken to the angiography suite on
     [**3163-7-24**] where MAC anesthesia was administered.  The patient's abdomen was
     prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.  A puncture site was localized
     by ultrasound due to the patient's body habitus and fluoroscopy was utilized
     to insure that the puncture site would be below the pleural reflection in the
     right mid-axillary line . After administration of 1% Lidocaine subcutaneously
     at the chosen puncture site located in the mid-axillary line, an Accu-Stick
     needle was advanced into the hepatic parenchyma to the hub of the needle.  The
     stylette was removed and administration of contrast while withdrawing the
     needle revealed filling of the proximal right hepatic duct.  Cholangiogram was
     performed at this time which revealed filling of the right and left hepatic
     ducts.  A right posterior duct was identified as a more distal location for
     drain placement.  Using a second Accu-Stick needle system, the needle was
     advanced under fluoroscopic guidance to the more distal right posterior duct.
     This required two to three passes before successful entry into the duct.  A
     micro-wire was then advanced through the needle passing into the common
     hepatic duct.  The wire was then exchanged for dilators and eventually a 7-
     French sheath.  With the sheath in the biliary system, the micro-wire was
                                                                 (Over)

     exchanged for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 935**] wire.  A Kumpe catheter was then advanced through the
     sheath over the wire and using the [**Location (un) 935**] and Kumpe catheters, the wire and
     catheter were able to be advanced through a common bile duct stricture and
     into the duodenum.  The [**Location (un) 935**] wire was then exchanged for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] wire for
     additional stiffness and the Kumpe catheter and 7-French sheath were removed
     and a longer 7-French sheath was introduced over the wire to its tip at the
     level of the common bile duct stricture.  The [**Doctor Last Name **] wire was then removed and
     a Brush biopsy device was advanced through the sheath.  Brushings were taken
     of the area of common bile duct stricture and the biopsy tip was sent to
     pathology.  The [**Doctor Last Name **] wire was then re-introduced over the sheath into the
     duodenum.  The sheath was then removed and an 8-French biliary stent was
     advanced through the [**Doctor Last Name **] wire. The [**Doctor Last Name **] wire was subsequently removed.  A
     pigtail was formed with the tip of the biliary catheter in the duodenum.  Tube
     cholangiogram was performed which confirmed tip of the biliary stent in the
     duodenum and biliary tube side holes above the level of the common bile duct
     obstruction.  The right and left hepataic ducts demonstrated successful
     filling.  The catheter was then secured into place with an 0-silk suture and
     Stat-Lock.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate
     post-procedure complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram demonstrating distal common bile
     duct obstruction.
     2.  Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drain placement.  The drain is 8-French
     in size and drains internally and externally.
     3.  Brush biopsy taken from area of common bile duct obstruction.  Sent for
     cytology.

     [**3163-7-24**].
     
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  Pancreatic mass.  Failed ERCP stent attempts.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically-acquired contiguous axial images of the abdomen and
     pelvis were obtained without and with IV contrast.  No oral contrast was
     given.
     
     CONTRAST:  200 cc of Optiray.
     
     No prior examinations for comparison.
     
     Pacreatic CTA:  There is a large low-attenuation hypovascular mass involving
     the head of the pancreas, measuring 3.5 x 3.9 cm.  The pancreatic duct is not
     dilated.  The common bile duct is dilated to 2.5 cm.  There is intrahepatic
     biliary ductal dilatation, involving both lobes. There are distinct fat planes
     between the pancreatic mass and the SMV and portal vein. There is no evidence
     of thrombus within the SMV or portal vein.  Branches of the celiac artery and
     SMA demonstrate normal conventional anatomy.
     
     Within the caudate lobe of the liver, there is a large ill-defined 2.6 x 5 cm
     lesion, which is isodense to the liver on noncontrast and delayed images. It
     demonstrates mild  peripheral nodular enhancement on the arterial phase.  A
     second hepatic lesion is located peripherally within segment VI, measuring 9
     mm.  The second lesion is hypodense, seen only on delayed images.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:  The spleen is normal in size.
     Adrenal glands and kidneys are unremarkable.  There is no hydronephrosis or
     nephrolithiasis.  Unopacified small and large bowel are normal in appearance.
     There is no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  No free fluid is identified.
     Patient is status post remote cholecystectomy.  Lung bases are clear.

     [**3163-7-24**].
     
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  Pancreatic mass.  Failed ERCP stent attempts.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically-acquired contiguous axial images of the abdomen and
     pelvis were obtained without and with IV contrast.  No oral contrast was
     given.
     
     CONTRAST:  200 cc of Optiray.
     
     No prior examinations for comparison.
     
     Pacreatic CTA:  There is a large low-attenuation hypovascular mass involving
     the head of the pancreas, measuring 3.5 x 3.9 cm.  The pancreatic duct is not
     dilated.  The common bile duct is dilated to 2.5 cm.  There is intrahepatic
     biliary ductal dilatation, involving both lobes. There are distinct fat planes
     between the pancreatic mass and the SMV and portal vein. There is no evidence
     of thrombus within the SMV or portal vein.  Branches of the celiac artery and
     SMA demonstrate normal conventional anatomy.

     entire procedure.
     
     INDICATION:  A 46-year-old gentleman with pancreatic mass and biliary
     obstruction.  Unable to stent via ERCP x 2.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  MAC
     
     CONTRAST:  120 ml of 60% Conray.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6155**] was taken to the angiography suite on
     [**3163-7-24**] where MAC anesthesia was administered.  The patient's abdomen was
     prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.  A puncture site was localized
     by ultrasound due to the patient's body habitus and fluoroscopy was utilized
     to insure that the puncture site would be below the pleural reflection in the
     right mid-axillary line . After administration of 1% Lidocaine subcutaneously
     at the chosen puncture site located in the mid-axillary line, an Accu-Stick
     needle was advanced into the hepatic parenchyma to the hub of the needle.  The
     stylette was removed and administration of contrast while withdrawing the
     needle revealed filling of the proximal right hepatic duct.  Cholangiogram was
     performed at this time which revealed filling of the right and left hepatic
     ducts.  A right posterior duct was identified as a more distal location for
     drain placement.  Using a second Accu-Stick needle system, the needle was
     advanced under fluoroscopic guidance to the more distal right posterior duct.
     This required two to three passes before successful entry into the duct.  A
     micro-wire was then advanced through the needle passing into the common
     hepatic duct.  The wire was then exchanged for dilators and eventually a 7-
     French sheath.  With the sheath in the biliary system, the micro-wire was
                                                                 (Over)

     catheter were able to be advanced through a common bile duct stricture and
     into the duodenum.  The [**Location (un) 935**] wire was then exchanged for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] wire for
     additional stiffness and the Kumpe catheter and 7-French sheath were removed
     and a longer 7-French sheath was introduced over the wire to its tip at the
     level of the common bile duct stricture.  The [**Doctor Last Name **] wire was then removed and
     a Brush biopsy device was advanced through the sheath.  Brushings were taken
     of the area of common bile duct stricture and the biopsy tip was sent to
     pathology.  The [**Doctor Last Name **] wire was then re-introduced over the sheath into the
     duodenum.  The sheath was then removed and an 8-French biliary stent was
     advanced through the [**Doctor Last Name **] wire. The [**Doctor Last Name **] wire was subsequently removed.  A
     pigtail was formed with the tip of the biliary catheter in the duodenum.  Tube
     cholangiogram was performed which confirmed tip of the biliary stent in the
     duodenum and biliary tube side holes above the level of the common bile duct
     obstruction.  The right and left hepataic ducts demonstrated successful
     filling.  The catheter was then secured into place with an 0-silk suture and
     Stat-Lock.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate
     post-procedure complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram demonstrating distal common bile
     duct obstruction.
     2.  Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drain placement.  The drain is 8-French
     in size and drains internally and externally.
     3.  Brush biopsy taken from area of common bile duct obstruction.  Sent for

     exchanged for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 935**] wire.  A Kumpe catheter was then advanced through the
     sheath over the wire and using the [**Location (un) 935**] and Kumpe catheters, the wire and
     catheter were able to be advanced through a common bile duct stricture and
     into the duodenum.  The [**Location (un) 935**] wire was then exchanged for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] wire for
     additional stiffness and the Kumpe catheter and 7-French sheath were removed
     and a longer 7-French sheath was introduced over the wire to its tip at the
     level of the common bile duct stricture.  The [**Doctor Last Name **] wire was then removed and
     a Brush biopsy device was advanced through the sheath.  Brushings were taken
     of the area of common bile duct stricture and the biopsy tip was sent to
     pathology.  The [**Doctor Last Name **] wire was then re-introduced over the sheath into the
     duodenum.  The sheath was then removed and an 8-French biliary stent was
     advanced through the [**Doctor Last Name **] wire. The [**Doctor Last Name **] wire was subsequently removed.  A
     pigtail was formed with the tip of the biliary catheter in the duodenum.  Tube
     cholangiogram was performed which confirmed tip of the biliary stent in the
     duodenum and biliary tube side holes above the level of the common bile duct
     obstruction.  The right and left hepataic ducts demonstrated successful
     filling.  The catheter was then secured into place with an 0-silk suture and
     Stat-Lock.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate
     post-procedure complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram demonstrating distal common bile
     duct obstruction.
     2.  Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drain placement.  The drain is 8-French
     in size and drains internally and externally.
     3.  Brush biopsy taken from area of common bile duct obstruction.  Sent for

     CONTRAST:  120 ml of 60% Conray.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6155**] was taken to the angiography suite on
     [**3163-7-24**] where MAC anesthesia was administered.  The patient's abdomen was
     prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.  A puncture site was localized
     by ultrasound due to the patient's body habitus and fluoroscopy was utilized
     to insure that the puncture site would be below the pleural reflection in the
     right mid-axillary line . After administration of 1% Lidocaine subcutaneously
     at the chosen puncture site located in the mid-axillary line, an Accu-Stick
     needle was advanced into the hepatic parenchyma to the hub of the needle.  The
     stylette was removed and administration of contrast while withdrawing the
     needle revealed filling of the proximal right hepatic duct.  Cholangiogram was
     performed at this time which revealed filling of the right and left hepatic
     ducts.  A right posterior duct was identified as a more distal location for
     drain placement.  Using a second Accu-Stick needle system, the needle was
     advanced under fluoroscopic guidance to the more distal right posterior duct.
     This required two to three passes before successful entry into the duct.  A
     micro-wire was then advanced through the needle passing into the common
     hepatic duct.  The wire was then exchanged for dilators and eventually a 7-
     French sheath.  With the sheath in the biliary system, the micro-wire was
                                                                 (Over)

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Patient with hematoma after PTC placement, pre-op for pancreaticoduodenectomy. 
      Please check progression of hematoma. 
     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     REASON FOR EXAM: Hematoma after PTC placement follouwup hematoma pre-op.
     
     TECHNIQUE: CT of the abdomen with and without contrast.
     
     Comparison is made to study dated [**3163-7-24**].
     
     FINDINGS: At the base of the right lung there is a new moderate to large sized
     pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis as compared to the prior study.
     There are no focal consolidations. The left lung base is clear. There is a
     large subcapsular liver hematoma which is somewhat heterogeneous in
     attenuation.  The subcapsular hematoma also extends into the liver parenchyma
      in the region of the medial portion of segment 6. The main portal vein is
     patent. However, there appears to be mass effect from the intraparenchymal
     hematoma compressing the right portal vein. Left portal vein is not well
     visualized on this study.
     There is no intrahepatic ductal dilation. Again is noted the lesion within the
     caudate lobe which is not changed from the prior study and which is thought on
     liver MR to be an hemangioma. The lesion located peripherally within the
     segment 6 on the prior study is not visualized on this study. The pancreatic
     head mass measures 3.3 x 3.8 cm and is not changed from the prior study. A
     percutaneous catheter is again visualized within the region of the pancreatic
     head. The adrenals, spleen, kidneys, large and small bowel are otherwise
     unremarkable in appearance. There is no free fluid or significant
     lymphadenopathy within the abdomen. The remaining intraabdominal vessels are
     unremarkable in appearance.
     
     The visualized osseous structures demonstrate no suspicious lytic or blastic
     lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION: Large subcapsular right lobe hepatic hematoma with extension into
     the liver parenchyma. There appears to be some compression on the right portal
     vein due to mass effect from the intraparenchymal hematoma. The previously
     visualized intrahepatic ductal dilation has resolved. Percutaneous
     catheter remains in place. Since prior study of [**3163-7-24**] there has been
     development of a moderate to large sized right pleural effusion. It does not
     have Hounsfield units consistent with hemorrhage, but rather simple pleural
     effusion.
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION:  46 year old man with painless jaundice, pancreatic mass and
     suspected liver mets.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Examination is being compared with prior CT scan performed
     [**3163-7-30**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were acquired through the abdomen at 5-mm
     intervals before the administration of intravenous contrast.
     
     Then, contiguous axial images were acquired after the uneventful
     administration of 200 cc of Optiray contrast medium intravenously.  The images
     were acquired at 2.5-, 5.0- and 5.0-mm intervals, respectively, after rapid
     bolus injection.  These images were then reconstructed at 1.25-, 2.5- and 2.5-
     mm intervals, respectively.
     
     Delayed images through the abdomen and pelvis were then acquired at 5-mm
     intervals.
     
     IV CONTRAST: 2oo ml Optiray. Fast injection bolus.
     
     CTA OF THE ABDOMEN (PANCREAS) W&W/O CONTRAST:  There is no aortic aneurysm.
     The celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery and their branches are patent
     and demonstrate normal vascular anatomy.  The renal arteries are normal.
     
     The evaluation of the venous phase demonstrates patent splenic, superior
     mesenteric and main portal vein.  The left portal vein is likewise patent. The
     anterior branch of the right portal vein is not visualized.  The posterior
     branch of the right portal vein is patent.
     
     There is a waist at the SMV just distal to the confluence with the splenic
     vein, consistent with grade III encasement. This is a new finding since the
     previous CTA and the possibility of rapidly infiltrating tumor is susspected.
     Furthermore, this new finding changes the CT criteria for resectability from
     probable to highly unlikely.
     
     All three hepatic veins and their branches are patent.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is evidence of a
     large right-sided pleural effusion with associated compressive atelectasis.
                                                                 (Over)

     The size of this effusion appears to have increased when compared to the prior
     examination.  The left lung base is clear.  There are no nodules or masses.
     
     A large subcapsular hematoma displacing portions of the right liver lobe is
     again seen.  This is slightly smaller when compared to the prior scan.  It now
     measures 14.6 cm x 6.0 cm in diameter.  An area of hemorrhage medial to this
     large subcapsular hematoma is again seen and measures 3.3 x 3.1 cm in
     diameter.  It shows interval decrease in size when compared to the prior
     examination.
     
     A percutaneous biliary drainage tube is seen with tip at the duodenum.  A mass
     is seen at the caudate lobe measuring 5.4 x 5.0 cm in diameter and showing
     peripheral nodular enhancement and delayed contrast enhancement consistent
     with the previously-described hemangioma.
     
     A mass is seen at the head of the pancreas measuring 3.8 x 3.5 cm in diameter.
     It is unchanged when compared to the prior examination.  The bile duct and
     pancreatic duct are not dilated.
     
     The spleen and adrenal glands are normal.
     
     No significant mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is seen.  The
     kidneys demonstrate symmetric contrast enhancement and excretion.  There are
     no renal masses.  There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or hydroureter.
     
     There is no free intraperitoneal fluid.  There is no pneumothorax.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The bladder, prostate and rectum are
     unremarkable.  There is no evidence of intrapelvic or inguinal
     lymphadenopathy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Other than degenerative changes in the spine, no suspicious
     osseous lesions are seen.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Multiplanar and volume rendering reconstructions were
     performed at the workstation and significantly enhance the evaluation of this
     case.
     
     IMPRESSION:  The anterior segment of the right portal vein is not well
     visualized, suggesting occlusion.  The occlusion may be secondary to mass
     effect from a large subcapsular hematoma compressing the right lobe of the
     liver.  The size of this subcapsular hematoma has minimally decreased in size.
     A second hematoma is seen medial to the larger subcapsular hematoma and has
     grossly decreased in size.  Again seen is a hemangioma at the caudate lobe.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     A waist is seen at the SMV just distal to its confluence with the splenic vein
     consistent with grade III encasement. This new finding is very worrisome
     because it suggests that resectability may be unlikely. If resection is still
     conteplated suggest hasten the time of operation. Otherwise, repeat CTA just
     prior to surgery for re-assement of resectability is advised.
     
     The previously described pancreatic head mass is unchanged in terms of size
     and imaging characteristics when compared to the prior examination.  There is
     evidence of pneumobilia.

     (Cont)
     The size of this effusion appears to have increased when compared to the prior
     examination.  The left lung base is clear.  There are no nodules or masses.
     
     A large subcapsular hematoma displacing portions of the right liver lobe is
     again seen.  This is slightly smaller when compared to the prior scan.  It now
     measures 14.6 cm x 6.0 cm in diameter.  An area of hemorrhage medial to this
     large subcapsular hematoma is again seen and measures 3.3 x 3.1 cm in
     diameter.  It shows interval decrease in size when compared to the prior
     examination.
     
     A percutaneous biliary drainage tube is seen with tip at the duodenum.  A mass
     is seen at the caudate lobe measuring 5.4 x 5.0 cm in diameter and showing
     peripheral nodular enhancement and delayed contrast enhancement consistent
     with the previously-described hemangioma.
     
     A mass is seen at the head of the pancreas measuring 3.8 x 3.5 cm in diameter.
     It is unchanged when compared to the prior examination.  The bile duct and
     pancreatic duct are not dilated.
     
     The spleen and adrenal glands are normal.
     
     No significant mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is seen.  The
     kidneys demonstrate symmetric contrast enhancement and excretion.  There are
     no renal masses.  There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or hydroureter.
     
     There is no free intraperitoneal fluid.  There is no pneumothorax.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The bladder, prostate and rectum are
     unremarkable.  There is no evidence of intrapelvic or inguinal
     lymphadenopathy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Other than degenerative changes in the spine, no suspicious
     osseous lesions are seen.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Multiplanar and volume rendering reconstructions were
     performed at the workstation and significantly enhance the evaluation of this
     case.
     
     IMPRESSION:  The anterior segment of the right portal vein is not well
     visualized, suggesting occlusion.  The occlusion may be secondary to mass
     effect from a large subcapsular hematoma compressing the right lobe of the
     liver.  The size of this subcapsular hematoma has minimally decreased in size.
     A second hematoma is seen medial to the larger subcapsular hematoma and has
     grossly decreased in size.  Again seen is a hemangioma at the caudate lobe.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     A waist is seen at the SMV just distal to its confluence with the splenic vein
     consistent with grade III encasement. This new finding is very worrisome
     because it suggests that resectability may be unlikely. If resection is still
     conteplated suggest hasten the time of operation. Otherwise, repeat CTA just
     prior to surgery for re-assement of resectability is advised.
     
     The previously described pancreatic head mass is unchanged in terms of size
     and imaging characteristics when compared to the prior examination.  There is
     evidence of pneumobilia.

     unchanged. A PTC drain enters within the right intercostal space, traverses
     through the collection, then through the liver and into the biliary tree and
     duodenum.  Pneumobilia is again noted, as expected.  Hypodense focus just
     posterior to the PTC drain is within the right aspect of the liver is again
     noted, and is slightly smaller in the interval.  Low density focus within the
     caudate lobe has previously been characterized as a hematoma. Mass within the
     head of the pancreas is unchanged.  The spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys

     INDICATION:  History of pancreatic mass S/P PTC, re-admitted with fever to
     102.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung bases to the pubic symphysis following administration of 150 cc of
     Optiray contrast.
     
     Comparison is made to the prior CT on [**3163-8-26**].
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is again seen a large right-sided
     pleural effusion with associated compressive atelectasis.  The left lung base
     is again clear.  There has been interval placement of a pigtail catheter
     entering through the right intercostal space through the large subcapsular
     collection noted along segment 6 and 7 of the liver.  This heterogeneous
     collection significantly decreased in size but still contains areas of high
     density that likely represent retractile clot as well as liquid and gas
     components.  This is again concerning for an infected collection.  The
     previously seen PTC drain is unchanged in position entering through the right
     intercostal space and with its tip terminating in the duodenum.  There is
     again seen pneumobilia.  The hypodense focus which is posterior to the PTC
     drain in the right lobe of the liver is unchanged.  The low density lesion
     within the caudate lobe is again unchanged.  The previously described
     pancreatic head mass is unchanged.  The spleen, adrenal glands and kidneys are
     unremarkable. There is no free air or free fluid.  The intra-abdominal loops
     of large and small bowel are unremarkable.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The bladder, distal ureters, prostate and
     seminal vesicles are unremarkable.  Rectum and sigmoid are unremarkable. There
     is no inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.  There is no free fluid.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious sclerotic or lytic lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Large mixed attenuation subcapsular collection has decreased in
     size since placement of pigtail catheter still concerning for infected
     collected.

     HISTORY:  Status post whipple and previous subcapsular hematoma; please
     evaluate for interval change.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     PRE AND POST-CONTRAST CT ABDOMEN:  There is a right pleural effusion which is
     essentially stable relative to the prior study of [**3163-8-29**].  There is
     associated compressive atelectasis at the right lung base.  The left lung base
     is clear.
     
     Again seen is a percutaneous transhepatic biliary drain.  Since the prior
     study there has been interval decrease in biliary air and biliary ductal
     dilatation.  A rounded area of hypodensity just posterior to the right PTBD
     has decreased in size now measuring 1.7 x 1.6 cm having previously measured
     3.0 x 2.8 cm.  Either represents an improving biloma or hematoma within the
     liver.  No new hypodense lesion is seen within the liver.  The subcapsular
     hematoma seen laterally has also diminished in size.  It still contains fluid
     and air and now measures 4.9 x 1.3 cm having previously measured 14.6 x 5.1
     cm.  The pig-tail catheter remains in place.  The spleen, adrenals, and
     kidneys are normal and stable in their appearance.  There are post-operative
     changes in the region of the pancreatic head consistent with the history of a
     whipple procedure.  There is only a tiny amount of residual peritoneum again
     likely due to the prior surgery.
     
     POST-CONTRAST CT PELVIS:  The bladder contains a small focus of air.  This may
     be due to recent catheterization and can be correlated with the clinical
     history.  The bladder is otherwise normal in appearance.  There is no pelvic
     ascites or lymphadenopathy.
     
     No lytic or blastic destructive osseous lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Interval decrease in size of the patient's subcapsular hematoma.
     2)  Interval improvement of a small biloma or hematoma within the liver near
     the patient's right PCBD catheter.
     3)  Interval decrease in biliary air and ductal dilatation.
     4)  Small focus of air within the bladder may be due to recent catheterization
                                                                 (Over)

     HISTORY: Whipple with choledochojejunostomy, assess anastomosis.
     
     TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS: Patient currently has a catheter placed at the confluence
     of the left and right hepatic ducts. Under real-time fluoroscopic evaluation,
     this tube was injected with approximately 30 cc of contrast. The biliary tree
     was completely decompressed, normal-sized intrahepatic biliary radicle to the
     second order. Contrast flowed from secondary to biliary radicles through the
     left and right ducts, beyond the confluence, through the common duct and into
     the jejunum. Ducts were widely patent. There was no evidence of any leakage at
     the anastomosis. There is normal peristalsis of the seizing jejunum.
     
     IMPRESSION: Widely patent choledochojejunostomy and without evidence of leak
     after a Whipple procedure. Of note is a biliary catheter which is of the
     pigtail type. Though locked, the pigtail is not formed within the biliary
     tree.

     liver.  Three of the lesions are located along the dome of the liver.  The
     largest measures 17 x 11 mm.  Also are multiple smaller lesions around the
     right inferior liver, the largest measuring 21 x 18 mm.  There is a
     hypodensity in the caudate lobe, which does not appear significantly changed
     compared to the prior study.  The subcapsular hematoma has resolved.  There
     are two cutaneous transhepatic catheters in place.  There is no singificant
     biliary dilatation.
     
     Patient is status post Whipple procedure.  There are surgical clips in the
     gallbladder fossa and sutures seen in the surgical bed.  There is a small
     amount of edema seen around the region of the bed for the pancreatic head.
     These changes have decreased compared to the prior study.  The remaining
     portion of the pancreas is within normal limits.  The adrenals and kidneys are
     normal.  There is no free fluid or significant lymphadenopathy.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS W/CONTRAST:  The small and large bowels are normal in course
     and caliber.  There is no free air, free fluid or pelvic lymphadenopathy.  The
     bladder is collapsed and cannot be adequately evaluated.  There are vasectomy
     clips present and there is a high-riding left testicle.
     
     Bone windows:  There are no suspicious lytic lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:

     HISTORY:  46 y/o status post Whipple for head of pancreas mass.  Status post
     PTC with subcapsular hematoma, now with percutaneous drain.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiple helically acquired axial images were obtained from the
