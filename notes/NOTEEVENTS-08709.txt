History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y ear old female with advanced Alzheimer's Disease, asthma, 
and recent Right distal femur fracture s/p ORIF on [**1-11**] presents 
[**1-18**] from nursing home with hypoxia. There, she was found to be 
tachypneic with RR in 30s, O2 sat 87% RA, 90% on 2L. EMS was 
called, and she was given SL NTG and IV lasix.  Per her 
daughter, over the past 2 days, she has been more somnolent than 
usual. She had no complaints except leg pain and involuntary 
movements of her right arm. She denied cough, shortness of 
breath, chest pain, urinary symptoms, diarrhea. Her daughter 
also noted that her left arm was swollen but does not know for 
how long. In the ED, the patient was febrile to 104.8. Her 
respiratory rate was in the 30s. Her O2 sats were 85-90% RA, and 
she was placed on NRB. Due to continued respiratory distress, 
she was intubated. Following intubation, she was noted to have 
coffee grounds in her ET tube, which cleared with lavage. She 
was given IV protonix, in addition to IVF, levofloxacin, 
vancomycin, metronidazole, combivent, and Decadron prior to 
admission to the medical ICU. 
On arrival to the FICU, she was sedated from propofol. She was 
shivering and diaphoretic.

[**1-18**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia. Prior inferior myocardial 
infarction. Prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction. ST segment 
elevation in leads II, III, aVF and V2-V3 raising the question 
of active ischemia. Followup and clinical correlation are 
suggested. No previous tracing available for comparison.  

[**1-18**] Right Tib/fib:  Diagnostic quality is limited by overlying 
casting material and probable diffuse osteopenia. There is an 
angulated and impacted comminuted fracture involving the distal 
right femoral metadiaphysis. Vascular calcifications are 
present. No leg or ankle fracture is evident, although 
assessment is again limited by casting material and osteopenia. 
Talar dome contour is smooth. A right-sided dynamic hip screw is 
seen in the right femur, but is incompletely assessed as it 
extends off the superior aspect of the imaged field of view. No 
Previous studies are available for comparison.

[**1-18**] Abdominal ultrasound: COMPLETE ABDOMEN ULTRASOUND: The 
right kidney measures 7.1 cm in length. The left kidney measures 
7.1 cm in length. There is no hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis. 
No perirenal fluid collections or masses are seen. The liver 
appears unremarkable without focal or textural abnormalities. 
There is no intra- or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The 
common bile duct measures 4 mm. Hepatic veins are patent but 
appear prominent and note is made of reflux indicating probable 
right heart insufficiency. The gallbladder is distended 
measuring 5.5 x 6.7 cm in size. The gallbladder contains sludge, 
no stones are seen. The gallbladder wall is within normal limits 
and no pericholecystic fluid is seen. The main portal vein is 
patent with appropriate flow directionality. The aorta is normal 
in caliber throughout its visualized portion. Aorta and IVC are 
patent with appropriate waveforms. The visualized portions of 
the pancreas appear unremarkable. Pancreatic tail is not well 
seen due to overlying bowel gas. The spleen measures 7.7 cm and 
appears normal. No ascites is seen.

[**1-18**] left upper extremity ultrasound: Left internal jugular, 
subclavian, axillary and brachial veins was performed with ormal 
compressibility, waveforms, augmentation and Doppler flow 
demonstrated. There is no evidence of intraluminal clot.

[**1-19**] CT abdomen/chest/pelvis: CT OF THE CHEST: Small mediastinal 
lymph[**MD Number 65**] are seen which do not meet criteria for pathologic 
enlargement. The caliber of the thoracic aorta is normal. The 
heart is not enlarged. There is a small simple pericardial 
effusion. Extensive coronary artery calcifications are seen. The 
lungs do not demonstrate any regions of consolidation. There are 
small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, and 
associated minimal lower lobe atelectasis. Narrowing of the main 
stem bronchi, particularly on the left is consistent with 
bronchomalacia. The non-contrast study limits assessment of 
abdominal organs. The liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal 
glands appear unremarkable. The gallbladder is distended 
measuring up to 0.9 cm, as was seen on the ultrasound. Contrast 
reaches the proximal colon. No dilated loops of bowel are seen. 
There is no free intraperitoneal air or ascites. There is 
hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis. The abdominal aorta 
demonstrates extensive atherosclerotic calcifications but is of 
normal caliber. Artifact from a right femoral screw limits 
assessment. A Foley catheter is within the bladder lumen. The 
rectum appears unremarkable. There is diffuse body wall edema 
consistent with anasarca. Small foci of subcutaneous air in the 
anterior abdominal wall are consistent with injection sites

[**1-19**] TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular  hypertrophy with normal cavity size. 
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction 
with severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum and 
anterior walls, and distal inferior wall. The apex is akinetic 
and mildly aneurysmal. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left 
ventricle. The remaining left ventricular segments contract 
normally. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with focal 
hypokinesis of the apical free wall (clip #48). The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not 
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is 
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 
There is a small circumferential pericardial effusion without 
evidence of hemodynamic compromise.  

[**1-21**] CXR: Endotracheal tube again seen with tip approximately 
3.5 cm above the carina right-sided subclavian line seen with 
tip in the region of the cavoatrial junction. Nasogastric tube 
is again seen coiled within the stomach. Cardiac and mediastinal 
contours appear stable. Again seen are bilateral pleural 
effusions and retrocardiac opacity unchanged from prior allowing 
for technical differences and low lung volumes.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with advanced Alzheimer's Disease, HTN, and 
right femur fx repaird on [**1-11**] presents with hypoxia, fevers, and 
coffee ground emesis.  As mentioned above, she was intubated and 
empirically covered with broad-spectrum antibiotics for presumed 
pneumonia, although CXR/Chest CT did not show a clear 
infiltrate. ICU course was notable for NSTEMI (peak TnT 1.13), 
with an echocardiogram showing regional dysfunction consistent 
with mid-LAD distribution, in addition to acute renal failure 
and metabolic acidosis. Multiple attempts in the ICU was 
unsuccessful in weaning her from the ventilator. After extensive 
discusions with her health care proxy/family, given her poor 
prognosis, it was decided to focus on comfort oriented care. She 
was extubated and made DNR/DNI (comfort measures only). She was 
started on an IV morphine drip and transferred to the general 
floor on [**2928-1-23**]. She passed away on [**2928-1-24**] at 8:25 p.m. Her 
daughter was notified, who declined an autopsy. The coverage for 
her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 12109**] was also notified.

     process.
     
     COMPLETE ABDOMEN ULTRASOUND:  The right kidney measures 7.1 cm in length.  The
     left kidney measures 7.1 cm in length.  There is no hydronephrosis or
     nephrolithiasis.  No perirenal fluid collections or masses are seen.  The
     liver appears unremarkable without focal or textural abnormalities.  There is
     no intra- or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.  The common bile duct measures 4
     mm.  Hepatic veins are patent but appear prominent and note is made of reflux
     indicating probable right heart insufficiency.  The gallbladder is distended
     measuring 5.5 x 6.7 cm in size.  The gallbladder contains sludge, no stones
     are seen.  The gallbladder wall is within normal limits and no pericholecystic
     fluid is seen. The main portal vein is patent with appropriate flow
     directionality.  The aorta is normal in caliber throughout its visualized
     portion.  Aorta and IVC are patent with appropriate waveforms.  The visualized
     portions of the pancreas appear unremarkable.  Pancreatic tail is not well
     seen due to overlying bowel gas.  The spleen measures 7.7 cm and appears
     normal.  No ascites is seen.
     
     LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY DOPPLER ULTRASOUND:  Grayscale and Doppler examination of
     the left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary and brachial veins was
     performed.  Normal compressibility, waveforms, augmentation and Doppler flow
     are demonstrated.  There is no evidence of intraluminal clot.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Distended, sludge containing gallbladder.  No other signs of cholecystitis
     are seen.  However, acalculous cholecystitis cannot be excluded. 
     2.  Prominent hepatic veins and reflux from the SVC indicative of right heart
     insufficiency.
     3.  No evidence of left upper extremity DVT.

     SEMI-ERECT AP CHEST:  No prior studies available for comparison.  The
     radiograph is obtained in an antilordotic angle which makes evaluation of
     heart size difficult.  The lungs appear grossly clear, atelectasis or
     infiltrate at the left lung base is difficult to exclude on this radiograph.
     The aorta is tortuous and heavily calcified.  The patient is significantly
     rotated.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Limited study due to patient rotation. Lungs are grossly clear
     without pneumothorax.

     INDICATION:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with fevers, hypoxia, and abdominal pain.
     
     COMPARISON:  Abdominal ultrasound from one day prior.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT scanning of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was
     performed after the administration of oral contrast.  The patient's creatinine
     was 2.7.  Coronal and sagittal reformations were obtained.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST:  The patient is intubated, there is a right subclavian
     central venous line with its tip extending into the central superior vena
     cava.  An orogastric tube is within the esophagus.  Small mediastinal lymph
     nodes are seen which do not meet criteria for pathologic enlargement.  The
     caliber of the thoracic aorta is normal.  The heart is not enlarged.  There is
     a small simple pericardial effusion.  Extensive coronary artery calcifications
     are seen.  The lungs do not demonstrate any regions of consolidation.  There
     are small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, and associated
     minimal lower lobe atelectasis. Narrowing of the main stem bronchi,
     particularly on the left is consistent with bronchomalacia.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN:  The non-contrast study limits assessment of abdominal
     organs.  The liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.
     The gallbladder is distended measuring up to 0.9 cm, as was seen on the
     ultrasound.  Contrast reaches the proximal colon.  No dilated loops of bowel
     are seen.  There is no free intraperitoneal air or ascites.  There is
     hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis.  The abdominal aorta demonstrates extensive
     atherosclerotic calcifications but is of normal caliber.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS:  Artifact from a right femoral screw limits assessment.  A
     Foley catheter is within the bladder lumen.  The rectum appears unremarkable.
     There is diffuse body wall edema consistent with anasarca.  Small foci of
     subcutaneous air in the anterior abdominal wall are consistent with injection
     sites.
     
     OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There is diffuse bony demineralization.  11 mm of
     anterolisthesis of L4 on L5 is seen.  There are compression deformities at L2
     and T12, whose chronicity is unclear.  There are healing rib fractures of the
                                                                 (Over)

     SEMI UPRIGHT PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH
     
     A right-sided subclavian central venous catheter has been pulled back with its
     tip likely within the superior right atrium. Endotracheal tube tip is
     approximately 1.7 cm from the carina and the balloon appears slightly over
     inflated.  Nasogastric tube is noted to be coiled within the fundus.  Marked
     patient rotation limits evaluation of the lung parenchyma, however, no new
     focal parenchymal consolidations, large effusions, or pulmonary edema is
     noted.  Calcifications are again identified within a tortuous thoracic aorta.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Tip of right subclavian central venous catheter likely within superior
     right atrium. Further withdrawal of 1-2 cm will likely place tip in distal
     SVC.
     
     2.  Endotracheal tube approximately 1.7 cm from carina with balloon appearing

     HISTORY:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with hypoxia fevers status post repositioning of
     endotracheal tube and right subclavian line.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to prior radiograph from earlier in the day at
     approximately 14:44.
     
     SEMI UPRIGHT PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH
     
     A right-sided subclavian central venous catheter has been pulled back with its
     tip likely within the superior right atrium. Endotracheal tube tip is
     approximately 1.7 cm from the carina and the balloon appears slightly over
     inflated.  Nasogastric tube is noted to be coiled within the fundus.  Marked
     patient rotation limits evaluation of the lung parenchyma, however, no new
     focal parenchymal consolidations, large effusions, or pulmonary edema is
     noted.  Calcifications are again identified within a tortuous thoracic aorta.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Tip of right subclavian central venous catheter likely within superior
     right atrium. Further withdrawal of 1-2 cm will likely place tip in distal
     SVC.
     
     2.  Endotracheal tube approximately 1.7 cm from carina with balloon appearing
     slightly over inflated.

     INDICATION:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with fevers, hypoxia, and abdominal pain.
     
     COMPARISON:  Abdominal ultrasound from one day prior.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT scanning of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was
     performed after the administration of oral contrast.  The patient's creatinine
     was 2.7.  Coronal and sagittal reformations were obtained.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST:  The patient is intubated, there is a right subclavian
     central venous line with its tip extending into the central superior vena
     cava.  An orogastric tube is within the esophagus.  Small mediastinal lymph
     nodes are seen which do not meet criteria for pathologic enlargement.  The
     caliber of the thoracic aorta is normal.  The heart is not enlarged.  There is
     a small simple pericardial effusion.  Extensive coronary artery calcifications
     are seen.  The lungs do not demonstrate any regions of consolidation.  There
     are small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, and associated
     minimal lower lobe atelectasis. Narrowing of the main stem bronchi,
     particularly on the left is consistent with bronchomalacia.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN:  The non-contrast study limits assessment of abdominal
     organs.  The liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.
     The gallbladder is distended measuring up to 0.9 cm, as was seen on the
     ultrasound.  Contrast reaches the proximal colon.  No dilated loops of bowel
     are seen.  There is no free intraperitoneal air or ascites.  There is
     hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis.  The abdominal aorta demonstrates extensive
     atherosclerotic calcifications but is of normal caliber.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS:  Artifact from a right femoral screw limits assessment.  A
     Foley catheter is within the bladder lumen.  The rectum appears unremarkable.
     There is diffuse body wall edema consistent with anasarca.  Small foci of
     subcutaneous air in the anterior abdominal wall are consistent with injection
     sites.
     
     OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There is diffuse bony demineralization.  11 mm of
     anterolisthesis of L4 on L5 is seen.  There are compression deformities at L2
     and T12, whose chronicity is unclear.  There are healing rib fractures of the

Pt was brought down to CT for head chest and abdomen scan without incident.  Once back from CT venous gas still showed acidosis so RR was increased to 18, pt started to auto-peep on higher rate and PIPs increased into 40's so RR was decreased.

     HISTORY:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with fever and hypoxia, now referred for
     assessment of endotracheal tube position after readjustment.
     
     COMPARISON:  Study from two hours ago today.
     
     FINDINGS:  Single semi-upright portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval
     pull back of the endotracheal tube, which now terminates in a high
     position with tip just below the thoracic inlet and cuff in the region of the
     larynx.  Nasogastric tube tip remains in the stomach.  Right subclavian
     central catheter tip is at the cavoatrial junction. Otherwise there has been
     no short interval change in appearance of the chest.  Left lower lung zone
     opacity has not significantly changed.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. High position of the ET tube and repositioning suggested.

     HISTORY:  Check for ET tube placement which has been repositioned.
     
     CXR, SINGLE SEMI-UPRIGHT PORTABLE FILM
     
     ET tube tip is just 1 cm above the carina.  This should be withdrawn another
     2-3 cm.  The right subclavian line and the NG tube appear satisfactory,
     although the NG tube is coiled with its tip lying in the gastric fundus.  Note
     is made of left lower lobe atelectasis/infiltrate as on film done earlier
     today as well as yesterday.
     
     CONCLUSION:  ET tube should be withdrawn another 2-3 cm.  Findings
     discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10049**] [**Name (STitle) **].

     change and repositioning of lines and tubes.
     
     Comparison is made to prior radiographs dated [**2928-1-20**].
     
     SINGLE SEMIERECT AP PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
     
     Since prior film, the endotracheal tube has been repositioned and is now
     approximately 2.5 cm from the carina.  Nasogastric tube remains cioled within
     stomach and right subclavian central venous catheter is unchanged in standard
     position.
     
     Right hemidiaphragm is now obscured which may be related to low lung volumes
     and component of lower lobe atelectasis and perhaps a small pleural effusion.
     Left lower lobe consolidation likely consisting of combination of fluid and
     atelectasis/consolidation is slightly worse.  Marked patient rotation makes it
     difficult to evaluate for signs of volume loss. There is no evidence of
     pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Interval repositioning of endotracheal tube with tip now approximately 2.5
     cm from carina.
     
     2.  Increased left lower lobe opacity likely representing combination of
     consolidation and fluid with new opacity in right lower lobe likely
     representing atelectasis with small fluid component.
     
     3.  NG tube coiled within stomach, tip may be in GE jxn or posterior fundus.
