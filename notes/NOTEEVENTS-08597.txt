     Reason: r/o obstruction                                             
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      84 year old man with N/V since this AM, decreased colostomy output, no bowel 
      sounds
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      r/o obstruction

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Nausea and vomiting since this morning, decreased colostomy
     output, no bowel sounds.  Evaluate for obstruction. Additional history of
     pancreatic cancer provided by referring clinician at the time of
     interpretation.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Single AP portable supine view of the abdomen.
     
     FINDINGS: There is marked gaseous distention of the stomach, and a paucity of
     bowel gas throughout the remainder of the abdomen.  An ostomy appliance is
     seen in the right mid abdomen.  An IVC filter is in place. The visualized
     portions of the lung bases appear unremarkable.  The surrounding osseous
     structures appear unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION: Gaseous distention of the stomach with a paucity of bowel gas
     elsewhere in the abdomen, nonspecific findings which could indicate gastric
     outlet obstruction or bowel obstruction.  These findings were discussed with
     the surgical resident at the time of interpretation.

     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Patient with ?bowel obstruction. Patient known to have stage IV
     pancreatic carcinoma.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Axial multidetector CT acquisitions of the abdomen and pelvis were
     acquired. No IV contrast was used due to possible remote history of allergy.
     Oral contrast was administered.
     
     COMPARISON:[**3370-11-19**]
     
     CT OF LUNG BASES: At least three large pleural-based lesions are identified,
     worrisome for metastasis. Inflammatory changes are identified.
     
     Some epicardial lymph nodes are identified.
     
     CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: A loop colostomy is in situ. Patient's stomach is
     dilated. Contrast is seen to run from the stomach all the way through to the
     stoma meaning that there is no complete obstruction. There is an increase in
     soft tissue surrounding the duodenum and pancreas extending from T2 close to
     T3/T4. An air-filled focus here likely represents a duodenal diverticulum.
     Spleen appears normal in size. Note is made of massively enlarged
     gastroepiploic vein, indicating probably splenic vein thrombosis, although in
     this noncontrast study this is uncertain. Adrenal glands appear normal. Some
     vascular calcifications are identified in the kidneys. Kidneys otherwise
     appear normal. There is at least one filter if not two filters within the
     inferior vena cava. Vascular calcifications are seen.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: Prostatomegaly is seen. Contrast is identified within
     the redundant distal colon which probably related to remote study. A catheter
     is within the patient's bladder. Scattered ascites is seen. In addition, there
     is generalized evidence of some mesenteric stranding and thickening as well as
     some omental stranding and thickening, some of which is more confluent and
     solid looking suggestive of caking.
     
     When compared to previous examination, there has been little interval change.
     The amount of ascites has increased. The previous study had IV contrast on
     board and shows the omental lesions more convincingly to represent tumor
     deposit.
                                                                 (Over)

     No evidence of obstruction. Extensive intraperitoneal carcinomatosis as
     described. Of note, the patient has a dilated gastroepiploic vein and while
     this does not interfere with the upper part of the stomach, if percutaneous
     gastrostomy is being considered it should be noterd that this vein does run
     along the anteroinferior surface of the stomach. Please see image 23 and 24.

stool in his colostomy bag. 
He noted that he had been having loose bowel movements/diarrhea 
which were black in color.  At the time of admission, he denied 
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, shortness of 
breath, palpitations, dizziness or lightheadedness, or chest 
pain. He noted that he has had difficulty swallowing recently 
and had one episode of ""dry heaves"" on the morning of admission. 


In the ED, he was found to have guaiac positive black stool in 
his ostomy bag. An NG tube was placed and was lavaged resulting 
in  bright red blood that was unable to clear with saline.  He 
was admitted to the MICU for presumed upper GI bleed.

Brief Hospital Course:
1.Upper GI bleed: Shortly after admission, the gastroenterology 
service performed an EGD.  This showed gastric fundal variceal 
bleeding with large blood clot in the fundus and abnormal mucosa 
in the stomach. He was given 4U FFP, 2U PRBC, 10mg SC Vitamin K, 
started on IV octreotide, and BID IV PPI on arrival.  He 
remained on an octreotide drip for five days. His hematocrits 
were cycled roughly q8hours and were noted to be stable. He was 
maintained on a PPI bid.  He had no further episodes of melena.  
He was discharged on p.o. protonix b.i.d. and instructed to 
discontinue coumadin for fear of a repeat episode of 
gastrointestinal bleeding.

2. HTN: The pt's blood pressure was stable for the duration of 
the hospital stay.  He was restarted on metoprolol on hospital 
day four.

3. DM2: He was initially managed with a sliding scale of regular 
insulin.  Once he began to take p.o., glipizide was 
re-introduced.

4. Hypothyroidism: The pt. was maintained on levothyroxine.

 
Medications on Admission:
1. Levoxyl 25 mcg once a day.  
2. Glipizide 5 mg once a day.  
3. Coumadin 2.5 mg every other day.  
4. Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg Tablet BID.  
 
Discharge Medications:
1. Glipizide 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).  
2. Levothyroxine Sodium 25 mcg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO 
DAILY (Daily).  
3. Pantoprazole Sodium 40 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.) Sig: 
One (1) Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.) PO Q12H (every 12 hours).
Disp:*60 Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)(s)* Refills:*2*
4. Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice 
a day.  

 
Discharge Disposition:

Discharge Diagnosis:
-upper gastrointestinal bleed, likely from gastric varices
-pancreatic cancer
-hypertension
-hypothyroidism
-type 2 diabetes mellitus
 
Discharge Condition:
Stable.

     Grayscale, color, and pulsed Doppler examination of the right and left common
     femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins was performed.  There is
     thrombus extending from the right proximal superficial femoral vein to the
     right popliteal vein and into a right calf vein.  This right sided
     thrombus appears to be occlusive from the level of the mid superficial
     femoral vein to the right popliteal vein.  There is thrombus extending from
     the left distal superficial femoral vein to the left popliteal vein through to
     the left calf veins.  The left- sided thrombus appears to be partially
     occlusive from the level of the distal superficial femoral vein to the
     popliteal vein.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Bilateral lower extremity DVTs as described above.
