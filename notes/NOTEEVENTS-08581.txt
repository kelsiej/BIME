Admission Date:  [**2930-8-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**2930-9-7**]

Date of Birth:   [**2854-12-23**]     Sex:  M

Service:

ADDENDUM:  The patient's discharge on [**2930-9-6**] was postponed
as his creatinine was found to be increased from 1.3 to 2.8.
A stat repeat creatinine was obtained which showed it to be
3.0.  As the patient does have a history of benign prostatic
hyperplasia, it was felt that the patient might have
postrenal obstructive failure.  Thus, a Foley catheter was
placed with a return of approximately 1,400 cc of urine.
Urology was consulted and it was learned that the patient has
a urologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who has followed the patient
previously.  His prostate is known to be extremely large and
the patient is already on Proscar for his benign prostatic
hypertrophy.

Thus, upon Urology's recommendation, the Foley will be left
in for approximately two weeks.  He should continue on
Proscar and Flomax was also added to his medicine regimen.
The following day a repeat creatinine was checked and it was
then noted to be 1.6, from his increase of 3.0.  Thus the
patient's postobstructive renal failure had resolved with
placement of the Foley and thus now is stable to be
discharged to the rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient's Foley should remain in
place for approximately two weeks.  The patient should
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Urology, in approximately two to
three weeks, for assessment of his prostate.  He should not
get any elective surgery in the next four to six weeks, after
his coronary artery bypass graft, and his first surgery
should be his meningioma excision, after which he recovers,
he can have his prostate issue explored.  Thus he will be
discharged to rehabilitation on [**2930-9-7**].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Flomax 0.4 mg po q day.
