Admission Date:  [**3335-2-1**]     Discharge Date:  [**3335-2-3**]

Date of Birth:   [**3295-2-23**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 39 year-old
male with a history of known coronary artery disease status
post non Q wave myocardial infarction previously in [**3333-10-11**] status post cardiac catheterization over at [**Hospital1 84**], which
revealed disease in the left anterior descending coronary
artery, diagonal and the right coronary artery.  It was felt
at that time the patient would be best managed medically in
the interim.  However, he continued to experience substernal
chest pain, which had radiated to his neck and arms after
walking approximately 100 to 150 steps.  He underwent an ETT
on [**11-12**] where he exercised for 7.5 minutes on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1078**]
protocol with ST depressions along with MIBI showing moderate
to severe perfusion defects in the distal anterior wall and
apex.  He was seen by his cardiologist who had recommended a
relook catheterization.  The patient was admitted for cardiac
catheterization to the [**Hospital1 75**].


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction
in 9/02.
2.  History of HIV with last CD4 count of 15 in 11/03.
3.  History of pancreatitis.
4.  History of cryptococcal meningitis.
5.  History of elevated cholesterol.
6.  History of pancreatitis in [**3332-2-11**] secondary to
HAART.

ALLERGIES:  Status post desensitization to Bactrim.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with a history of hypertension.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife.  He has a
twenty pack year history of smoking.  He quit one year ago.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Abacavir 300 mg po b.i.d.
2.  Atorvastatin 10 mg po q day.
3.  Azithromycin 1200 mg po q week.
4.  Didanosine 400 mg q day.
5.  Fluconazole 400 mg q day.

11.  Tenofovir 30 mg po q day.
12.  Tricor 54 mg po q.d.
13.  Ursodiol 300 mg po b.i.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's temperature is 97.5.
Heart rate 93.  Blood pressure 107/52.  Respirations 22.
Sating 100% on room air.  In general, he is a tired appearing
male in no acute distress, thin, cachectic.  HEENT pupils are
equal, round and reactive to light.  Sclera anicteric.
Oropharynx is clear with moist mucous membranes.  Neck was
supple.  No JVD or bruits.  Heart was regular rate and
rhythm.  Normal S1 and S2.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Lungs clear bilaterally.  Abdomen soft, nontender,
nondistended with good bowel sounds.  Extremities no edema.
Alert and oriented times three.  Extraocular movements
intact.  Moving all extremities.  Sensation to light touch
intact in all four extremities.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  The patient's white blood cell
count was 3.1, hematocrit 27.1, hemoglobin 9.0, platelets 95.
INR 1.0, PTT 38.8, PT 12.4.  Urinalysis had a specific
gravity of greater then 1.035 with negative nitrate and
negative leukocyte esterase.  Chem 7 sodium was 133,
potassium 3.3, chloride 103, bicarb 22, creatinine 0.7, BUN
17, glucose 163, cholesterol 145, triglycerides of 180, HDL
29 and LDL of 80.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 39 year-old male with a
history of HIV/AIDS and coronary artery disease status post
cardiac catheterization.  The patient initially underwent a
cardiac catheterization, which was notable for the left main
with no significant obstructive coronary artery disease.  The
left anterior descending coronary artery had a mid to
proximal 95% vessel true bifurcation lesion and to a diagonal
branch.  The left circumflex had a serial 70% stenosis and
the right coronary artery had a proximal serial 40 to 50%
stenosis.  The initial hemodynamics revealed normal filling
pressures and a calculated ejection fraction of 65%.  The
patient on the following day had undergone interventional
cardiac catheterization where he underwent drug eluding stent
placement in the circumflex and left anterior descending
coronary artery.  This catheterization was notable for 20%
distal stenosis in the left main.  Left anterior descending
coronary artery had approximately 20% with 90% bifurcation
lesions involving diagonal branch along with a more distal
70% lesion and the left circumflex had a 70% serial lesion.
The procedure had been notable for successful percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting of the mid
left circumflex along with percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty and stenting of the mid left anterior descending
coronary artery with jailing of the D1.  However, during this
procedure the patient had dropped his blood pressure to the
70s initially.  This may have also been secondary to large
vagal maneuver as well.  He was transferred to the Coronary
Care Unit for further hemodynamic monitoring.

The patient had responded to dopamine.  The patient's
baseline blood pressures had been in the 90s.  He tolerated
his wean from Dopamine during this hospital course.
Otherwise the patient had an decrease in his hematocrit from
admission of 27.1 to 22.5.  He had been transfused 2 units of
packed red blood cells with an appropriate bump in his
hematocrit.  His other white blood cells and platelets were
at his baseline values.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction
in [**3333**].
2.  Status post cardiac catheterization with intervention to
the circumflex and left anterior descending coronary artery
with stent placement.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Same as those on admission.

     lung bases to the pubic symphysis following the administration of 120 cc of
     intravenous Optiray.
     
     CONTRAST:  Oral and intravenous nonionic contrast were administered due to the
     rapid rate of bolus injection required for this examination.
     
     COMPARISON:  No prior comparable examinations are available.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  At the base of the right lower
     lobe and within the left lower lobe are scattered areas of interstitial
     opacity.  The lung bases are otherwise free of nodules or masses, and there is
     no pleural effusion.  The liver demonstrates mild intrahepatic biliary ductal
     prominence, and the common bile duct measures 9 mm in greatest diameter.  The
     gallbladder is non-distended and there is no abnormal gallbladder thickening
     and no evidence of cholelithiasis.  The pancreas appears unremarkable.  The
     spleen is prominent, measuring 13.7 cm.  The adrenals appear unremarkable.
     There are symmetric nephrograms bilaterally.  Within the lateral lower pole of
     the right kidney is a tiny hypodense rounded lesion, too small to
     characterize.  The large and small bowel loops are normal in caliber and wall
     thickness.  There are multiple subcentimeter mesenteric lymph nodes.  Adjacent
     to the cecum is an area of stranding of the pericolonic fat without evidence
     of focal fluid collection or abscess.  The aorta is normal in caliber
     throughout.  There is no free fluid and no free air within the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The bladder, distal ureters,
     prostate and seminal vesicles, and rectum appear unremarkable.  There is no
     inguinal or pelvic lymph adenopathy.  A surgical clip is present in the left
     inguinal region.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate no evidence of suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony
     lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Mild uncomplicated mesenteritis without evidence of abscess.
     2.  Scattered foci of interstitial prominence at the lung bases.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      characterize b/l upper lobe infiltrates seen on CXR                             
     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Bilateral upper lobe infiltrates on chest x-ray.  Persistent
     fever without source, cough, and HIV with CD4 count of 15.
     
     COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray [**3335-2-10**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast chest CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymph adenopathy.  A
     small low-density focus is seen within the left lobe of the thyroid gland.
     Correlate clinically and with ultrasound.  Coronary artery stents are noted.
     There are no pleural effusions.  There is no pericardial effusion.  There are
     patchy bilateral infiltrates in an upper lobe and peripheral distribution.
     These infiltrates relatively spare the mid- and lower lung zones.  Within the
     left lower lobe posteriorly, there is a 1.5 cm cystic space without internal
     debris.
     
     Limited imaging of the upper abdomen does not demonstrate overt abnormality. A
     small hypodense foci at the dome of the liver may relate to the hepatic veins,
     but are not completed characterized on this unenhanced exam.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION: Bilateral patchy infiltrates, predominantly within the upper lobes
     peripherally.  Given the patient's fever and immuno-comprosimed status, an
     infectious source is likely, with PCP and viral pneumonias being diagnostic
     possibilities.  Given the patient's very low CD4 count, mycobacterial
     infection is also a diagnostic consideration.

     HISTORY:  Abdominal pain with advanced HIV disease.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired axial images were obtained from the lung bases
     to the pubic symphysis following the administration of oral and IV contrast.
     Coronal reformatted images were obtained.
     
     CONTRAST:  100 cc of Optiray was administered due to patient request.
     
     COMPARISON: [**3335-2-11**]
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH ORAL AND IV CONTRAST:  No pleural effusions or
     pulmonary nodules at the lung bases.  There is no significant change in the
     intrahepatic biliary ductal prominence.  No new focal hepatic lesions.  The
     common bile duct is not changed in appearance.  The gallbladder is normal in
     appearance.  The pancreas is unremarkable, without masses.  The spleen is
     unchanged.  The adrenal glands are within normal limits.  The kidneys are
     normal with an unchanged small hypodensity within the mid-pole of the right
     kidney, too small to characterize.  Again seen are multiple sub-cm mesenteric
     lymph nodes, but no pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal
     lymph nodes.  No free air or free fluid within the abdomen.  The aorta is
     normal in size.  Compared to prior study, the wall thickening within the
     ascending colon, cecum, and terminal ileum is more pronounced.  There is
     associated stranding of the fat in this region.  There is no fluid collection
     or abscess in this region.  The appendix is not definitively seen, but there
     are no findings to specifically suggest appendicitis.  The ureters are normal.
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH ORAL AND IV CONTRAST:  The bladder, distal ureters,
     prostate, rectum, and sigmoid colon are within normal limits.  No
     pathologically enlarged inguinal or pelvic lymph nodes.  No free fluid within

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: HIV positive patient with CMV colitis and recurrent fever.
     
     COMPARISON: [**3335-4-22**].
     
     TECHNIQUE: Helically aquired contiguous axial images of the abdomen and pelvis
     were obtained with oral contrast and IV Optiray.  Multiplanar reconstructions
     were performed.
     
     ABDOMEN CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are no opacities or pleural effusions at
     the visualized lung bases.  There is stable intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
     The common bile duct does not appear dilated.  There is no evidence of an
     hepatic abscess.  The spleen is enlarged. The gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal
     glands, and the left kidney are unremarkable.  There is a stable subcentimeter
     low attenuation lesion in the lower pole of the right kidney, which is too
     small to characterize but likely represents a cyst. There are stable
     mesenteric lymph nodes. There is no free air or free fluid.
     
     PELVIC CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a short segment of terminal ileum
     demonstrating wall thickening, without any adjacent stranding. There is no
     wall thickening in the remainder of the bowel.  There is no free fluid. The
     bladder, prostate and seminal vesicles are unremarkable.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  The visualized osseous structures do not demonstrate any
     evidence of bone destruction.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Multiplanar reconstructions are essential in delineating
     the bowel anatomy.  There is wall thickening in a short segment of terminal
     ileum.  Otherwise, the previously noted inflammatory changes in the right
     lower quadrant are markedly improved.
     
     IMPRESSION: Near complete resolution of CMV colitis/ileitis. No abscess.

     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The lung bases are clear without evidence
     of effusions, nodules or opacities.
     
     There is a stable intrahepatic biliary ductal dilataion.  No other hepatic
     abnormality is seen.  There is stable splenomegaly.  The gallbladder,
     pancreas, adrenals and the left kidney are unremarkable.  A stable
     subcentimeter low attenuation area is seen in the low part of the right kidney
     which is too small to characterize and likely represents a simple cyst.  The
     proximal ureters are normal.  A few scattered mesenteric lymph nodes are
     visuzlied.  There is no free-air or free-fluid.  The abdominal loops of small
     and large bowel appear unremarkable.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Again seen is a short segment of terminal
     ileum with mucosal thickening without evidence of any adjacent stranding.  The
     large bowel appears unremarkable.  There is no free-air or free-fluid.  The
     urinary bladder, distal ureters, prostate and seminal vessicles appear normal.
      The rectum has an air fluid level consistent with patient's diarrhea. The
     sigmoid colon is unremarkable. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
     
     No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified in the osseous
     structures.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Multiplanar reconstructions confirm the presence of
     mucosal thickening in the short segment of the terminal ileum.

     INDICATION:  40 y/o man with AIDS, fever and intermittent dizziness.
     
     MR OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT & WITH CONTRAST:
     
     COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with prior head CT performed [**3335-7-6**] and MR
     of the head performed [**3334-5-26**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 & T2W images are obtained through the brain pre and
     post-administration of gadolinium.
     
     MR OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT & WITH CONTRAST:  There is no intra or extraaxial
     mass, mass effect or shift of the normally midline structures.  There is
     normal [**Doctor Last Name 30**]-white matter differentiation.  Normal vascular flow patterns are
     preserved.  There are no major vascular territorial infarcts.  There are a few
     scattered small foci of increased FLAIR signal, predominantly within the
     subcortical and deep white matter, nonspecific in appearance.  There is no
     associated abnormal enhancement.  These are unchanged from prior study.  There
     is a rim of restricted diffusion along the margin of the left, and, to a less
     extent, occipital [**Doctor Last Name 234**] of the right lateral ventricle.  Signal abnormality
     appears to extend into the surface of the left corpus callosum.  No
     abnormalities are seen in this region on any other sequence.  No prior
     diffusion-weighted imaging is available for comparison.  There is no evidence
     of abnormally increased enhancement along the ventricular surface.  A small
     focal area of increased T2 signal is noted within the anterior aspect of the
     sphenoid sinus consistent with a retention cyst or polyp.  The visualized
     orbits and paranasal sinuses are otherwise unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Rim of restricted diffusion within the left lateral ventricle and possibly
     corpus callosum are of uncertain clinical significance, given the lack of
     findings on other pulse sequences.  Although this finding may be artifactual
     in origin, meningitis cannot be excluded and CSF sampling is suggested if
     there is clinical concern for meningitis.
