Admission Date:  [**3239-12-23**]       Discharge Date:  [**3240-1-3**]

Date of Birth:   [**3150-12-3**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CT Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 89 year old
female who was transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1294**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5**] [**First Name (Titles) 6**]
[**Last Name (Titles) 7**] on [**3239-12-23**] from [**Hospital3 1942**] Hospital,
where she was recently admitted and ruled in for a myocardial
infarction.  She was transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1294**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5**]
[**First Name (Titles) 6**] [**Last Name (Titles) 7**] for catheterization and evaluation for
possible coronary artery bypass grafting.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Known coronary artery disease,
status post stent to left anterior descending artery in [**3235**];
cardiac catheterization in [**3236**] revealed three vessel disease
as well as in-stent stenosis with a left ventricular ejection
fraction of 49% at that time.  2.  Left cerebral infarction
in [**3238-2-10**].  3.  History of ventral hernia.  4.
Gastrointestinal perforation, status post partial colectomy
in [**3236**] with subsequent colostomy reversal.  5.  History of
anxiety.  6.  History of lumbar disk disease.  7.  History of
arthritis, status post multiple fractures.  8.  Right hip
bursitis.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Norvasc 10 mg p.o.q.d., Captopril
75 mg p.o.t.i.d., Lopressor 75 mg p.o.t.i.d., enteric coated
aspirin 325 mg p.o.q.d.; the patient was transferred to
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1294**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5**] [**First Name (Titles) 6**] [**Last Name (Titles) 7**] receiving Lovenox
injections.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination on admission,
the patient had a blood pressure of 128/70, heart rate 82,
oxygen saturation 93% in room air and she was afebrile.
General:  Elderly female in no acute distress.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat:  Unremarkable.  Neck:  Without jugular
venous distention, supple.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and
rhythm with premature ventricular contractions, grade II/VI
apical systolic murmur, positive S3.  Pulmonary:  Crackles
one-half way up the left and one-third up the right lung
field.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, positive
bowel sounds, ventral hernia, well healed surgical scars.
Extremities:  Trace pedal edema bilaterally and warm to
touch.  Neurological:  Alert and oriented with no focal
deficits evident.

LABORATORY DATA:  Admission chest x-ray revealed
cardiomegaly, mild congestive heart failure with no pleural
effusions.  Electrocardiogram at [**Hospital3 1942**] Hospital
showed 1.[**Street Address 985**] elevations in V4 through V6.  Admission
laboratory were unremarkable.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the
catheterization laboratory on [**3239-12-26**], where
catheterization revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction
of 50% as well as significant three vessel coronary artery
disease and moderate mitral regurgitation.

Cardiothoracic surgery consultation was obtained at that time
by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  Also on [**3239-12-26**], the patient
underwent carotid duplex studies which ruled out any
hemodynamically significant lesion of either left or right
internal carotid artery.

The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**3239-12-27**], where she underwent coronary artery bypass grafting
times two with a saphenous vein graft to the ramus
intermedius and saphenous vein graft to the right posterior
descending artery.  Postoperatively, she was transported from
the Operating Room to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit on
Levophed, nitroglycerin and propofol intravenous drips.

The patient was weaned off of her Levophed and her blood
pressure was stable.  Her cardiac function remained good.
She was started on oral antihypertensive medications.  On
postoperative day number two, the patient was transferred
from the Intensive Care Unit to the telemetry floor and had
begun to be evaluated and treated from cardiac rehabilitation
and physical therapy standpoints.

On postoperative day number three, at approximately 9:30 in
the morning, the patient was noted to be in rapid atrial
fibrillation with a ventricular response in the 120s.  She
was treated with intravenous Lopressor, which controlled her
rate, and was started on oral amiodarone.

The patient continued to progression on the floor over the
next couple of days with cardiac rehabilitation, however, she
still remained somewhat unsteady on her feet and unable to
ambulate independently.  It was felt best at this point to
have her screened for a rehabilitation facility.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient remains hemodynamically
stable today, [**3240-1-3**], on postoperative day number
seven, and is ready to be transferred to a rehabilitation
facility.  Her temperature is 98.4, pulse 70, respiratory
rate 18 and blood pressure 136/66.  The most recent
laboratory values are from today, [**3240-1-3**], which
reveal a white blood cell count of 6,000, hematocrit 27.9,
platelet count 211,000, sodium 142, potassium 4.8, chloride
103, bicarbonate 33, BUN 23, creatinine 1 and glucose 107.
The most recent chest x-ray is from [**3239-12-30**] which
reveals small bilateral effusions with no pneumothorax.  The
patient's weight today is 75 kilograms, which is up slightly
from her preoperative weight of 72.8 kilograms.
Neurologically, the patient is alert and oriented without
apparent focal deficit.  Lungs are clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Heart has a regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen
is benign.  Sternum is stable without drainage.  Extremities
are warm.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Lasix 20 mg p.o.q.d. times one week.
Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o.q.d. times one week.
Colace 100 mg p.o.b.i.d.
Zantac 150 mg p.o.b.i.d.
Captopril 12.5 mg p.o.q.8h.
Lopressor 25 mg p.o.b.i.d.
Percocet 5/325 mg one to two tablets p.o.q.4-6h.p.r.n. pain.
Amiodarone 400 mg p.o.t.i.d. times two more days then 400 mg
p.o.b.i.d. times one week then 400 mg p.o.q.d.; remaining on
the amiodarone beyond that length of time will be left to the
discretion of the patient's primary care cardiologist.
Aspirin 325 mg p.o.q.d.
Benadryl 25 mg p.o.q.h.s.p.[**Initials (NamePattern5) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern5) 314**].
Ibuprofen 400 mg p.o.q.6h.p.r.n. pain.
Alphagan eye drops 0.2% one drop o.u.b.i.d.
Saline eye drops o.u.t.i.d. and p.r.n.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
    bypass grafting.
2.  Postoperative atrial fibrillation.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to follow up with her primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2172**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 611**], and primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11913**], in three to four weeks.  She is to follow up
with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of cardiothoracic surgery in four to
five weeks after discharge from the hospital.

     enlargement.  The pulmonary vessels show no definite evidence of cardiac
     failure at this time.  However, there is evidence of some
     collapse/consolidation of the left lower lobe behind the heart and some

     tip terminating in the mid SVC. Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal drain
     are noted. There is obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, possibly
     representing a combination of left lower lobe atelectasis and small effusion.
     Lungs are well aerated. There may be a small right pleural effusion. The
     skeleton is demineralized.

     loops or a pelvic mass. There are no abnormal calcifications.
