Admission Date:  [**2837-8-7**]       Discharge Date:  [**2837-8-21**]

Date of Birth:   [**2759-1-23**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CT [**Doctor First Name **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78-year-old gentleman
who presented to the cardiac catheterization laboratory after
being referred for approximately three episodes of chest pain
while walking followed by a positive exercise tolerance test.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history was
significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,
noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus, a positive family
history, bilateral claudication, carotid stenosis, prostatic
cancer treated with radiation therapy, glaucoma and a right
inguinal hernia repair.  The patient also stated that he had
a transient ischemic attack with one episode of loss of
speech; however, this resolved spontaneously after two
minutes with no further symptoms following this episode.

ALLERGIES:  There were no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Glucovance 1.25 mg/250 mg p.o. q.d.
Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
Xanax 0.5 mg p.o. p.r.n. for anxiety.
Pravachol 40 mg p.o. q.d.
Toprol XL 50 mg p.o. q.d.
Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Laboratory values on admission
to the hospital were unremarkable with the exception of a
blood glucose level of 259.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient's physical
examination on admission was also unremarkable with stable
vital signs.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory and underwent a cardiac
catheterization, which revealed a left ventricular ejection
fraction of 55% and a left main coronary artery occlusion of
90% as well as three vessel coronary artery disease.  He was
taken to the operating room as a result of these
catheterization findings on [**2837-8-7**], where underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting times four with a left
internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending
artery, a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal artery,
a saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery and
a saphenous vein graft to the first branch of the diagonal
artery.

Postoperatively, the patient was transported from the
operating room to the cardiac surgery recovery unit on
intravenous nitroglycerin and propofol drip.  He remained
intubated until postoperative day #1 due to slightly excess
amounts of postoperative bleeding and coagulopathy, which
were corrected over the first 12 to 18 hours.

On postoperative day #1, the patient was weaned from the
mechanical ventilator and extubated.  He was noted to be in
atrial fibrillation and was started on intravenous amiodarone
drip and Lopressor.  As he became to become more awake, the
patient was noted to be extremely confused, agitated and
occasionally combative, requiring sedation at times.
Diuresis was initiated.

On postoperative day #3, there was a concern for aspiration
due to excessive coughing noted when the patient was given
any oral medication.  The patient was evaluated by the speech
therapist, who felt that the patient was at high risk for
aspiration and a nasogastric tube was inserted to initiate
nutritional support during this time.

There was a question of an aspiration pneumonia.  Although
this was not evident by chest x-ray, the patient had a lot of
respiratory secretions with a significant cough and a bit of
an elevated white blood cell count and it was felt prudent to
place him on empiric antibiotic therapy of levofloxacin and
Flagyl to cover him for possible aspiration pneumonia.  The
only significant chest x-ray finding over the few days were
bilateral pleural effusions.

The patient remained in the cardiothoracic intensive care
unit over the next few days essentially for close monitoring,
pulmonary toilet issues and control of atrial fibrillation.
He was transferred to the telemetry floor out of the
intensive care unit on postoperative day #5.  The patient was
noted to be very agitated and combative at that time and he
was also back in rapid atrial fibrillation.  This was treated
with intravenous Lopressor.  The patient was given some
sedation as well as soft restraints for the patient's safety.

Over the next few days, the patient remained hemodynamically
stable in atrial fibrillation.  His pulmonary status was
marginal, partly due to his mental status and inability to
cooperate with pulmonary toilet efforts.  He was begun on low
dose Coumadin for anticoagulation for his atrial
fibrillation.  The patient was slow to progress over the next
few days with physical therapy.

The patient's other concern over these few days was his blood
sugar, which was very difficult to control.  The [**Hospital **]
Clinic was consulted and assisted with glucose control.

The patient was maintained with nasogastric tube feedings
over the time that he continued to be an aspiration risk.
The speech therapy service continued to follow the patient
regularly.  The patient went for a video swallow study on
postoperative day #7, which revealed no aspiration at that
time, simply delayed swallowing.  It was the speech
therapist's recommendation to begin an oral diet with a
pureed diet and honey-thick liquids and avoidance of thin
liquids.  This was initiated and the patient tolerated this
without problems.

On [**2837-8-18**], postoperative day #11, the patient continued to
have marginal respiratory status with intermittent episodes
of tachypnea and hypoxia.  A chest x-ray was obtained that
showed bilateral effusions, left greater than right, and a
left thoracentesis was performed.  The patient improved
clinically and his followup chest x-ray revealed no
pneumothorax and significant resolution of the pleural
effusion.

On postoperative day #13, [**2837-8-20**], the patient remained
hemodynamically stable.  He was in atrial fibrillation with a
controlled ventricular rate.  His pulmonary status was much
more stable than it had been.  He had a good, strong cough.
Another chest x-ray was obtained for surveillance purposes
and this revealed small bilateral pleural effusions without
other significant x-ray findings.  The patient's mental
status had completely cleared and he was alert and oriented
and it was felt appropriate to screen him for rehabilitation
placement at this time.  It was also noted at this time that
the patient was somewhat dehydrated by laboratory values with
a sodium of 147 and a BUN of 50 and the patient was given
more fluids at that time.

Today, [**2837-8-21**], postoperative day #14, the patient remains
hemodynamically stable.  He is stable from a pulmonary
standpoint and is ready to be discharged to a rehabilitation
facility.

VITAL SIGNS ON DISCHARGE:  The patient has a temperature of
95.5��F, a pulse of 66 in atrial fibrillation, a respiratory
rate of 22, a blood pressure of 130/60 and a room air oxygen
saturation of 95%.

LABORATORY DATA ON DISCHARGE:  The most recent laboratory
values today are as follows:  a white blood cell count of
11,900, hematocrit of 26.3 and platelet count of 379,000.
The prothrombin time is 19.9 and the INR is 2.6.  There is a
sodium of 146 (which is down from 147 on [**2837-8-20**]), potassium
of 4.2, chloride of 107, bicarbonate of 29, BUN of 44 (which
was down from 50 yesterday), creatinine of 1.1 and blood
glucose of 55 this morning (which has come up with oral
juice.)

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  Neurologically, the
patient is alert and oriented, without apparent neurologic
deficit.  On pulmonary examination, the patient has coarse
rhonchi bilaterally with a few bibasilar crackles, left
greater than right.  The patient has a productive cough.  His
room air oxygen saturation is 95%.  The patient is in atrial
fibrillation, S1 and S2, without murmur.  The sternum is
stable.  The incision is intact with no drainage.  The
staples to the incision show no drainage or erythema.  The
abdominal examination is benign.  The patient is tolerating
his oral intake without problem.  He is urinating
spontaneously.  Peripherally, the patient has warm
extremities with palpable pulses.  The left leg incision has
a small amount of serosanguinous drainage around the
incision.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Coumadin for atrial fibrillation with the patient to
receive 1 mg today with a target INR of 2.0
2.  Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Atrovent metered dose inhaler with spacer two puffs
q.i.d.
4.  NPH insulin 20 units subcutaneous q.a.m.:  The patient
had been on b.i.d. NPH insulin.  However, since he had been
on b.i.d. insulin and his tube feeds were discontinued, his
blood sugars in the morning had been on the low side and it
was felt more appropriate to simply give him NPH in the
morning only and to follow the rest of his blood sugars
q.i.d. with sliding scale insulin until the patient is eating
normally and then readjust his insulin dose at that time.
5.  Calcium carbonate 750 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6.  Pravachol 40 mg p.o. h.s.
7.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
8.  Sliding scale regular insulin before meals and at
bedtime:  for a blood sugar of 150 to 200, three units; for
201 to 250, six units; for 251 to 300, nine units; and, for
301 to 400, 12x units.
9.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. times five days and then
p.o. q.d. times seven days, then 200 mg p.o. q.d.
10. Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. times three more days.
11. Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. times three more days.
12. Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
13. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
14. Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass
grafting.
Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Hypertension.

     FINDINGS: There is bilateral increased density in both lung fields,
     predominantly in both lung bases consistent with bilateral pleural effusions
     and bilateral atelectasis of the lower lobes. The cardiac silhouette is within
     normal limits. There is a mild widening of the mediastinum although is
     probably related to the supine possition of the patient and AP projection. A
     right jugular line is demonstrate with its distal tip at the level of the
     right atrium. ETT is noted approximately 4 cm above the carina. A chest tube
     is also noted in the left hemithorax although the inferrior aspect is not seen
     as the laung bases were not included i the film. A repeat chest X- ray is
     recomended for evaluation of this region.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1. Bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis of the lower lobes

     CLINICAL INDICATION:  78 year old man status post CABG.  Increased shortness
     of breath.
     
     A single AP upright portable radiograph of the chest was obtained and compared
     to the next-prior study of [**2837-8-9**].
     
     Again identified is an introducer sheath entering from a right IJ approach.
     Its tip is unchanged in position since the prior study.  There are sternotomy
     sutures and staples overlying the mid chest, consistent with recent CABG.
     In the interval since the prior study, the overall heart size has remained
     stable.  There has been an interval decrease in the prominence of the
     pulmonary vascularity, consistent with improving left heart failure.
     Bilateral pleural effusions persist.  There has been perhaps slight interval
     increase in the left pleural effusion with an interval decrease in the right
     pleural effusion.  No focal areas of consolidation are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Improving left heart failure status post CABG.

     The cardiac silhouette is stable.  Ill-defined left upper lobe opacity is

     for a new site of infection.  Improving left upper lobe opacity, which
     probably represents resolving infection.

     HISTORY:  78 year old male with known right internal jugular and subclavian
     thrombosis, now off of heparin due to a GI bleed.  Evaluate for progression of
     thrombus.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to a previous exam of [**2837-11-6**].  [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and
     Doppler sonograms of the right internal jugular and subclavian veins again
     show extensive thrombus within the visualized portion of the internal jugular
     vein.  The visualized subclavian vein demonstrates normal compressibility,
     flow and augmentation.  No intraluminal thrombus is identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Limited right upper extremity ultrasound shows persistence of the
     previously-described right internal jugular vein thrombus.  The previously-
     seen thrombus within the subclavian vein is no longer appreciated.

     with fever.
     
     Endotracheal tube is 6 cm above carina. NG tube extends below diaphragm. Heart
     size is normal. There is flattening of the diaphragms consistent with COPD.
     Small bilateral pleural effusions with some upper zone redistribution
     consistent with CHF superadded to COPD. In addition there is ill-defined
     opacity in the right upper lobe which could be due to area of consolidation.
     There is obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm likely due to a combination of
     left pleural effusion and atelectasis and/or consolidation in the left lower
     lobe. Overall appearances are unchanged since the prior study of [**2837-11-19**].
     
     IMPRESSION: COPD with probable CHF, small bilateral pleural effusions and

     Reason: f/u infiltrate/chf
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      78 year old man with s/p CABG, NIDDM, HTN, diastolic dysfunction, s/p sternal
      debridement and flap closure. Now s/p tracheostomy.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Follow-up infiltrate, status post sternal debridement and flap
     closure, now with tracheostomy.
     
     AP radiograph dated [**2837-11-24**] is compared with the AP radiograph dated
     [**2837-11-21**].  The tracheostomy is in proper position.  The NG tube extends below
     the level of the diaphragm.  The heart size is normal.  There is diffuse
     infiltrate involving the left lung and right upper lobe.  This appears
     slightly worse compared with [**2837-11-21**].  There are small bilateral pleural
     effusions.
     
     IMPRESSION:  With the sparing of the right lower lobe and right middle lobe
     there is air trapping or decreased pulmonary vascular flow.  This is an
     atypical pattern for heart failure.

SOCIAL WORK NOTE:
     Received RN referral to meet with pt's wife to introduce self and offer support.  Met with pt's wife at bedside.  Her name is [**Name (NI) **] and they have been married for 32 years.  They live in an apt in [**Location (un) 3239**] and she has been taking a taxi back and forth to visit pt here because she does not drive and does not feel comfortable using public transportation.  Pt is intubated and was resting during visit with wife.
     Pt's wife reports that pt had a quadruple bypass in August and then went to rehab and then had several ED visits and a hospitalization and then came here when his chest incision opened.  She states that he has been here for 3-4 weeks which makes her feel ""lousy"" because she misses him being at home and is worried about his condition.  They do not have any children and she reports receiving some support from his family including nieces and nephews.  She had been friendly with a woman in their apt building but is feeling estranged from her at this time due to this woman's husband's own illness and her involvement with him.
     Pt's wife raised the issue of ""how long do [**Doctor First Name **] allow this to go on?"" with regards to pt's long hospital course.  It seems that she is getting some input from pt's family that this is ""going on too long"".  However, pt's wife was then able to articulate quite clearly that in many conversations with pt, he stated when they would see an ""unfortunate person"" and she would state that she would not want to be alive in such situations, he would then state ""I would want to live.""  She feels strongly informed and guided by these conversations.  Notified SICU attending of this aspect of conversation with wife.
     This SW will remain involved as needed.  Pager [**Pager number 169**].

Family given update about pt's condition.  He remains on ventilator and continues to have a lower GI bleed.  He is having feeding issues and is receiving TPN.  Team has recommended a colonoscopy to try to isolate the site of the bleeding.  Pt's wife is in favor of this.  She reiterated her prior comments re: conversations throughout her 32 year marriage with pt which indicate to her that he would want to ""keep fighting"" and moving forwards with medical intervention.  Pt's nieces seem concerned about the long-term picture for pt but seemed reassured that there are opportunities for further conversation as pt does or does not progress.  There does seem to be a slight disconnect between pt's wife and his other family members but they were pleasant towards each other during the meeting and all seemed satisfied with the information that they received and the opportunity for discussion with medical team.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      long term iv access for medications
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  78 y/o man status post CABG, sternal wound infection/debridement,
     pneumonia, acute renal failure.  Needs IV access for long term medications and
     nutrition.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5088**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1865**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1845**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5346**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1865**], the
     staff radiologist, was present throughout the entire procedure.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:  1% Lidocaine for local anesthesia.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE:  The patient was placed in a supine position on the
     angiographic table. A right upper extremity ultrasound was performed in order
     to find an accessible vein as none could be palpated on physical examination.
     After administration of 1% Lidocaine for local anesthesia, the right brachial
     vein was accessed under sonographic guidance using a 21 gauge needle. A .018
     guide wire was advanced through the needle to the level of the lower SVC under
     continuous fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was exchanged for a 5 FR dilator
     and peelaway sheath.  After removing the dilator, a 5 FR dual lumen PICC,
     trimmed to 45 cm, was advanced over the wire. The peelaway sheath was
     simultaneously removed.  A spot radiograph was obtained to confirm PICC
     position.  The skin entry site was cleansed and the PICC was affixed to the
     skin with a stat lock and transparent dressing.  The patient tolerated the
     procedure well.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     FINDINGS:  A preprocedural right upper extremity sonogram shows a widely
     patent and compressible right brachial vein. Post procedure radiograph shows
     the tip of the PICC within the lower SVC.  There is no pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Technically successful placement of a 45 cm, 5 FR dual lumen PICC
     via the right brachial vein with the tip in the lower SVC.  The line is ready
     for immediate use.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     debridement.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2837-11-29**].
     
     PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST at 16:25:  The left CPA and extreme left lateral lung is
     not entirely included on this film and therefore cannot be evaluated.  The ETT
     has been replaced by a tracheostomy tube.  There may be slight overdistension
     of the tracheostomy cuff. There is an NG tube in place, the tip of which is
     difficult to visualize.
     
     There continues to be increased hazy opacity over both lungs consistent with
     bilateral pleural effusions. The pulmonary vascularity remains indistinct,
     consistent with a moderate degree of CHF, worse since the previous exam.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Worsening CHF.  Layering bilateral pleural effusions.  There is increased
     lucency around the tracheostomy tube, which suggests that the cuff may be
     overdistended.

     seen beyond the Ligaments of Treitz.  A small amount of contrast material was
     injected and a spot radiograph obtained to confirm the position of the tip.
     The pre-existing orogastric tube was then removed.  The patient tolerated the
     procedure well.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     FINDINGS:  A post-procedure spot radiograph shows the tip of the N-J tube
     beyond the Ligament of Treitz.  Contrast material is seen filling the proximal
     jejunum.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      long term iv access for medications
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  78 y/o man status post CABG, sternal wound infection/debridement,
     pneumonia, acute renal failure.  Needs IV access for long term medications and
     nutrition.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5088**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1865**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1845**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5346**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1865**], the
     staff radiologist, was present throughout the entire procedure.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:  1% Lidocaine for local anesthesia.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE:  The patient was placed in a supine position on the
     angiographic table. A right upper extremity ultrasound was performed in order
     to find an accessible vein as none could be palpated on physical examination.
     After administration of 1% Lidocaine for local anesthesia, the right brachial
     vein was accessed under sonographic guidance using a 21 gauge needle. A .018
     guide wire was advanced through the needle to the level of the lower SVC under
     continuous fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was exchanged for a 5 FR dilator
     and peelaway sheath.  After removing the dilator, a 5 FR dual lumen PICC,
     trimmed to 45 cm, was advanced over the wire. The peelaway sheath was
     simultaneously removed.  A spot radiograph was obtained to confirm PICC
     position.  The skin entry site was cleansed and the PICC was affixed to the
     skin with a stat lock and transparent dressing.  The patient tolerated the
     procedure well.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     FINDINGS:  A preprocedural right upper extremity sonogram shows a widely
     patent and compressible right brachial vein. Post procedure radiograph shows
     the tip of the PICC within the lower SVC.  There is no pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Technically successful placement of a 45 cm, 5 FR dual lumen PICC
     via the right brachial vein with the tip in the lower SVC.  The line is ready
     for immediate use.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:
     78-year-old male status post CABG with complicated postoperative course
     requiring long-term feeding.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:
     Drs. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5088**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1865**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 513**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1865**], Staff Radiologist,
     was present throughout the procedure.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:
     30 ml of Optiray 320 at 60%; 100 mcg fentanyl and 1mg versed in divided doses
     under continued hemodynamic monitoring.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:
     The procedure was described to the patient's family and informed consent was
     obtained. The stomach was insufflated with air, and two T-fasteners were
     placed to secure the anterior stomach to the anterior abdominal wall
     following puncture of the anterior wall of the stomach using a 19 gage needle.
     The 19 gauge needle from the T- fastenter kit was then advanced into the
     stomach a third time, and an 0.035 [**Last Name (STitle) 223**] guidewire was inserted through the
     needle. A 7 French sheath was then exchanged for the needle, and a small
     amount of contrast material was injected subsequently and confirmed a gastric
     access. A 4 French multipurpose catheter was then advanced through the sheath,
     and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 223**] wire was exchanged for an 0.035 Stiff glidewire. Both the Stiff
     glidewire and multipurpose catheter were manipulated through the pylorous
     and duodenal bulb and well beyond the ligament of Treitz. The Stiff glidewire
     was exchanged for an Amplatz Superstiff 0.035 glidewire, and the multipurpose
     catheter and 7 French sheath were removed. The tract was then dilated up to 14
     French, and a 14 French dilator/peelaway sheath was advanced over the Amplatz
     wire under fluoroscopic guidance. The inner dilator was removed, and a 14
     French [**Doctor Last Name 936**] gastroduodenostomy catheter was advanced over the guidewire and
     through the peelaway sheath which was simultaneously removed. Traction was
     placed on the suture material, forming the loop in the second portion of the
     duodenum. The catheter was then sutured to the patient's skin using 0 Prolene
     material.
     
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:
     78-year-old male status post CABG with complicated postoperative course
     requiring long-term feeding.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:
     Drs. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5088**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1865**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 513**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1865**], Staff Radiologist,
     was present throughout the procedure.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:
     30 ml of Optiray 320 at 60%; 100 mcg fentanyl and 1mg versed in divided doses
     under continued hemodynamic monitoring.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:
     The procedure was described to the patient's family and informed consent was
     obtained. The stomach was insufflated with air, and two T-fasteners were
     placed to secure the anterior stomach to the anterior abdominal wall
     following puncture of the anterior wall of the stomach using a 19 gage needle.
     The 19 gauge needle from the T- fastenter kit was then advanced into the
     stomach a third time, and an 0.035 [**Last Name (STitle) 223**] guidewire was inserted through the
     needle. A 7 French sheath was then exchanged for the needle, and a small
     amount of contrast material was injected subsequently and confirmed a gastric
     access. A 4 French multipurpose catheter was then advanced through the sheath,
     and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 223**] wire was exchanged for an 0.035 Stiff glidewire. Both the Stiff
     glidewire and multipurpose catheter were manipulated through the pylorous
     and duodenal bulb and well beyond the ligament of Treitz. The Stiff glidewire
     was exchanged for an Amplatz Superstiff 0.035 glidewire, and the multipurpose
     catheter and 7 French sheath were removed. The tract was then dilated up to 14
     French, and a 14 French dilator/peelaway sheath was advanced over the Amplatz
     wire under fluoroscopic guidance. The inner dilator was removed, and a 14
     French [**Doctor Last Name 936**] gastroduodenostomy catheter was advanced over the guidewire and

SOCIAL WORK NOTE:
     Family meeting held this afternoon with pt's wife, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known patient lastname 5455**], this SW, RN [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 197**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5452**], Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 869**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1691**].  The latter two are from the MICU team to which pt's care has been transferred.  Pt remains on the CTIC/SICU at this time.
     Medical team asked pt's wife for her perspective on pt's condition from what she has been told by team previously and from her own impressions of her interactions with him.  She reported that she has ""noticed a change in the last few days... he looks past me, through me.""  Medical team gave her an update about pt's lack of alertness and his increased level of neurologic injury.  Pt has not made progress towards being removed from the ventilator.  The question was raised of whether it would be best to shift focus of pt's care towards comfort and pt's wife said that she has been thinking this same thing over the past week.  She said, ""I don't want him to hurt anymore, I don't want him to be invaded anymore...""  She did not want to consent to a lumbar puncture because she believed that it would be unnecessarily uncomfortable for pt without long-term gain towards a meaningful recovery.  She plans to think about possible shift towards comfort measures overnight and will talk with staff further tomorrow.  Staff offered assistance in communicating the above to pt's sister and nieces and nephew to help take the burden off of his wife but she seemed determined to talk with them on her own by telephone tonight.
     This SW met at length with Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 5455**] before meeting and she reports that she is having an on-going struggle with the noisiness of her upstairs neighbors and she seems to feel threatened by them in some way.  She is having great difficulty sleeping.  She has made attempts to reach their building manager.  This SW offered assistance with this effort but she declined.  This SW also suggested police intervention and perhaps a reprieve of a couple nights by securing a hotel room nearby the hospital to increase [**Doctor Last Name 5**] and decrease her efforts in getting here.  She declined these options as well.  Staff encouraged her to talk with her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]: [**Doctor Last Name 5**] issues which she says she has done before and RN assisted her to call PCP from the unit after family meeting.  PCP wanted pt to go to [**Hospital1 275**] to be evaluated by him but she chose against this.  It seems likely that she will try to move to a new apt. soon but she was holding off to see the results of pt's long-term condition.  We also spoke at length about the ways in which her husband's decline is echoing her first husband's death from a prolonged brain tumor when she was 30.  She seems to be doing some anticipatory grieving for her husband but is also feeling her grief for her first husband renewed as pt's hospitalization goes on.  Pt's wife is unfortunately isolated in many ways although she mentioned that she might try to reach her sister whose husband died in August.  Staff encouraged this during this meeting.
