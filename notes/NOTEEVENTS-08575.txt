Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to medicine for treatment of her pain 
and management of her COPD in conjection with orthopedic 
attention to her fx.

1 bilateral supracondylar fracture
The patient was placed in bilateral air casts while in the ED.  
Her pain was controlled with narcotics and she underwent initial 
closed reduction of her posterior 90% angulated comminuted R 
supracondylar fracture while in the ED.  She was also noted to 
be hypotensive with a Hct that had dropped from 30.9 to 26.3.  
She was transfused and given IVF.  Abdominal CT was negative for 
intraabdominal / retroperitoneal bleed.  Post transfusion, she 
remained hemodynamically stable with stable serial Hct b/w 
30-33.8. guiaic (-) and no obvious source of bleed found.
Because of her severe osteoporosis and COPD, it was determined 
that the risk of ORIF was too high, and that conservative 
management of her fx's with bilateral leg casts for 6 wks would 
provide greater benefit than surgery.  She will need 
anticoagulation during this time for DVT prophylaxis and 
extensive rehab afterwards.  Her pain is currently being 
controlled with tylenol q6h and 5-10 mg of oxycodone Q4 hours 
prn. However, pt often forgets to ask for the pain medicine so 
it is important to remind her to ask for medicine for pain 
relief. She lives in a home that is accessable only by stairs 
and would not be able to enter her home while in bilateral leg 
casts. Pt on aggressive bowel regimen with adequate BM's. She 
will f/u with orthopedics service on [**10-16**].
2. Respiratory distress-Patient with tachypnea (up to RR of 36), 
inc wob, tachycardia, and diaphoresis on hospital day 7. Her 
decline in respiratory status was most likely due to combination 
of very poor baseline pulmonary function (restrictive and 
obstructive disease), (aspiration) pneumonia, and derecruitment 
from being in bed so much. EKG with no significant changes and 
CTA with no evidence CTA did show evidence of emphysema, b/l pl 
effusions, and LLL pneumonia-likely aspiration. Mrs.[**Known patient lastname 11926**] was 
started on levofloxacin and vanc as her respiratory status 
continued to deteriorate. On [**9-27**] pt was transferred to the MICU 
for evaluation/initiation of BIPAP. Vanc d/ced and flagyl added 
to cover ? aspiration PNA.  Echo to r/o CHF in unit revealed: 
EF>55% and mild symmetric LV hypertrophy. Pt respiratory status 
improved and tachypnea resolved with BIPAP during 2 days in 
unit. Transferred back to floor [**9-29**] on 4LO2 with intermittent 
BIPAP. However, on floor despite multiple attempts at 
administering BIPAP, pt repeatedly refused stating she 
understood the importance of it but felt that the mask was too 
suffocating. Despite this, pts respiratory status continued to 
improve, breathing comfortably, and her sats remained >92% on 
4LO2. She was discharged to rehab on 4L02(her home requirements 
prior to admission). She is to continue her abx regimen 
(levofloxacin 500mg QD and Flagyl 500mg TID) until [**10-10**].
3. COPD - On admission, pt was placed on inhaled steroids and 
bronchodilators.  O2 was continued at her baseline requirement 
of 4L.  She remained >94% as long as NC in place until hosp day 
7 when she became tachypneic,tachy, inc wob and occasional 
desats to mid 80's. Her decline in respiratory status was 
attributed to COPD exacerbation in setting of PNA requiring 
BIPAP. IV steroids were started in the MICU and pt was switched 
to oral prednisone on [**9-29**] with 2 week taper. ON discharge ([**10-3**]) 
she was on 40 mg of prednisone. Taper as follows: 30mg X3 days 
([**Date range (1) 1891**]), 20mgX3 days([**Date range (1) 11927**]), 10mgX3days([**3204-10-9**]), and 
5mgX3days([**Date range (1) 11928**]).Pt should cont. atrovent, flovent, and prn 
albuterol MDI's. 
4. Cardiac: pt presented with HTN(177/108) which improved with 
lopressor. pt was continued on lopressor during admission and 
started on asa. HR remained 90-120's during admission. Pt with 
occassional(1-2Xper week) substernal chest pain which is typcial 
for her for months. Relieved spontaneously or with sublingual 
nitro. R/o for MI on admission. Repeat EKG's with no significant 
changes when compared to old ekg's. Some concern for ? afib on 
admission - paramedics noted ""atrial fibrillation"" at the scene. 
 No prior history of afib.  In the ED, EKG was sinus rhythm and 
she remained in sinus rhythm throughout admission. 
5.Anemia: Most recent hct levels found from [**3288**] at which time 
baseline b/w 33-36. Pt required transfusion on admission with 
hct 30-33 s/p transfusion. Iron studies within normal limits 
with iron 65, ferriten 18, TIBC 355. Guiaic negative. NO obvious 
bleed. Pt transferred total of 6 units PRBCs, although she 
remained hemodynamically stable throughout admission. Hct on d/c 
was 32.7
5. Osteoperosis-cont calcitonin, calcium, vitamin D. Fosamax 
restated prior to discharge. Pt is to be in straight UPRIGHT 
position for 30 minutes after fosamax is given to avoid GI 
upset. Pt on fall precautions given fragile body frame and h/o 
falls.
6.Depression - Pt seen by social worker while in ICU, no SSRI 
was started during admission as contraindicated in patient 
taking ultram. Was on risperidone prn during admission.
7. FEN - On admission pt was started on QID fingersticks with 
SSRI to cover if blood glucose >200. Pt required no insulin 
during admission even while on steroids. Cont replacement of 
calcium/phosphorus at rehab.
8. PPx: pt on protonix, lovenox 30mg SC for at least 6 weeks 
while b/l casts in place. may consider stopping lovenox once 
patient ambulating again.aggresive bowel regimen; 
fall/aspiration precautions.

     HISTORY: 66 year-old-female with COPD and need for intravenous medications.
     Please place single lumen PICC line.
     
     PHYSICIANS: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1165**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1558**], Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1559**]
     [**Name (STitle) 1129**], and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 79**] [**Name (STitle) 43**] d'Othee. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 43**] [**Name (STitle) 44**], the staff
     radiologist was present and supervising throughout the entire procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE: The patient was placed supine on the angiography table. Her left
     upper extremity was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion. Since
     no suitable superficial vein was visible, ultrasound was used for localization
     of an appropriate vein. The left basilic vein was patent and compressible. The
     skin was anesthetized with 3 cc of 1% Lidocaine. Under ultrasonographic
     guidance, the left basilic vein was accessed using a 21-gauge micropuncture
     needle. A 0.018 guidewire was advanced through the access needle into the
     superior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance. The skin entry site was
     incised with a #11 blade scalpel. The access needle was exchanged for a 4-
     French micropunture sheath with inner dilator. The inner dilator was removed.
     Based on the markers on the guidewire, it was determined that a length of 31
     cm would be appropriate. The PICC line was then trimmed to length and advanced
     over the guidewire through the peel-away sheath into the superior vena cava.
     The guidewire and peel-away sheath were removed. The catheter was flushed,
     capped, and heplocked. It was secured to the skin using a Stat-Lock device.
     
     FINDINGS: A final AP chest x-ray was obtained, demonstrating the tip of the
     catheter to be present in the superior vena cava just above the right atrium.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: None.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 31 c long, 4-French single lumen PICC
     line via the left basilic vein. The tip of the catheter is present in the
     superior vena cava. The line is ready for immediate use.

If foley continues to leak I have asked MD if we can give pt a trial without foley to see if she can use bedpan without getting cast wet. We will do this if needed.  Her UO remains low and few NS boluses have been given to improve UO.

Access: Pt has one peripheral IV and I was not able to get in another. She is on antibiotics for the pneumonia as well as fluids. PICC line scheduled to be done this eve.

ID: Afebrile on flagyl/levo.

Endo: Pt is on steroids and glucose has been a little high requiring sliding scale coverage at times.

Skin: Pt's coccyx has two small stage two ulcers. uoderm replaced due to it falling off. Pt does not turn well and is at risk for further skin breakdown so Kinaire bed ordered and obtained. Ortho came by and trimmed back the cast on her right thigh due to it getting soiled with stool. They said it is a temporary fix and may need to be recasted next week. Call ortho tech coverage over the WE with any problems.

MICU NPN 7PM-11PM:
Breif Update to previous note written earlier. Pt has had stable mental status and vital signs. She went down to IR and had PICC placed without incident. Pt was assisted on/off the bedpan for mod sized stool. Ortho tech came by to cut off the soiled portion of the cast on her right leg.  The foley has also  stopped leaking after more NS was added to the balloon. She continues to have marginal UO but has not required further boluses. Her resp status is stable on the four liters NC and the p[[**Doctor First Name **] is to try either nasal c-pap or mask ventillation tonight.

Of note at 10PM pt called me to tell me that her right leg was throbbing with increased pain since her last turning in the bed. I inspected the top portion of the cast and no skin breakdown is noted. I have called the team, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5981**]  [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] has been notified and will come up to examine and talk to pt avout the new pain. Pt isvery distraught about being NPO and so immobile and now with the increased pain is unhappy and stating she would rather die than go through any more of this. I have given her a dose of fiorinal and team will asses when they are able.
