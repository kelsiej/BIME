     INDICATION:  Bilateral swelling and edema.  Charcot changes on radiographs,
     history of right ankle fracture.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained through both ankles and feet
     without intravenous contrast.  Sagittal and coronal reformations were
     performed.
     
     COMPARISON:  Radiographs of both ankles and feet from [**2878-8-10**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There is evidence for a prior fracture of the distal fibula.  There
     is also a deformity of the distal tibia, likely secondary to a fracture of the
     medial malleolus, which extends posteriorly along the tibial plafond. There is
     slight varus angulation at the right ankle mortise.  The talar dome is smooth,
     without evidence for collapse.  No acute fractures are identified on the
     right.  There is no evidence for acute fracture, dislocation, or bony
     proliferative or destructive changes.
     
     On the left, there is moderate anterior tilt of the talus.  There are
     neuropathic changes within the left midfoot, with fragmentation, destruction,
     and disorganization of the midfoot.
     
     There is diffuse osteopenia bilaterally.  Also noted is diffuse edema within
     the soft tissues bilaterally, consistent with anasarca.  There is a ghost
     track within the right calcaneus, likely from prior external fixation device.
     There are diffuse vascular calcifications.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Neuropathic changes within the left midfoot.  Infection is not excluded.
     2. Remote fractures of the medial and lateral malleolus on the right.
     3. Osteopenia.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Bilateral swelling and edema.  Charcot changes on radiographs,
     history of right ankle fracture.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained through both ankles and feet
     without intravenous contrast.  Sagittal and coronal reformations were
     performed.
     
     COMPARISON:  Radiographs of both ankles and feet from [**2878-8-10**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There is evidence for a prior fracture of the distal fibula.  There
     is also a deformity of the distal tibia, likely secondary to a fracture of the
     medial malleolus, which extends posteriorly along the tibial plafond. There is
     slight varus angulation at the right ankle mortise.  The talar dome is smooth,
     without evidence for collapse.  No acute fractures are identified on the
     right.  There is no evidence for acute fracture, dislocation, or bony
     proliferative or destructive changes.
     
     On the left, there is moderate anterior tilt of the talus.  There are
     neuropathic changes within the left midfoot, with fragmentation, destruction,
     and disorganization of the midfoot.
     
     There is diffuse osteopenia bilaterally.  Also noted is diffuse edema within
     the soft tissues bilaterally, consistent with anasarca.  There is a ghost
     track within the right calcaneus, likely from prior external fixation device.
     There are diffuse vascular calcifications.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Forty-six year old man with diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency and
     NSTEMI one week ago. 
      
     SUMMARY OF EXERCISE DATA FROM THE REPORT OF THE EXERCISE LAB: 
     Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142  
     mg/kg/min. Two minutes after the cessation of infusion, Tc-99m sestamibi was
     administered IV. 
      
     INTERPRETATION:  
     Image Protocol: Gated SPECT. 
     Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium-201. 
     Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images. 
      
     Stress images show enlargement of the LV cavity.  At stress, there are no
     myocardial perfusion defects identified.  Resting perfusion images show slight
     enlargement of LV cavity, but less prominent than at stress.  At rest, there are
     no myocardial perfusion defects identified. 
      
     Ejection fraction calculated from gated wall motion images obtained after
     Dipyridamole administration is 55%.  Wall motion is normal. 
      
     As compared to prior exercise MIBI dated [**2878-8-2**], the enlargement of the LV
     cavity is slightly more prominent today. 
      
     IMPRESSION:  1) No myocardial perfusion defects.  EF of 55%.  2) Enlargement of
     the LV cavity is worse at stress than at rest and may represent balanced three
     vessel ischemia or other type of cardiomyopathy.  Enlargement of the LV cavity
     during stress is slightly more pronounced than on the prior study.

     Evaluate for pulmonary edema.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2878-9-12**].
     
     CHEST, 2 VIEWS:
     
     FINDINGS:  The heart size is within normal limits.  The mediastinal and hilar
     contours are normal, there is no significant change from the prior study of
     [**2878-9-12**].  The pulmonary vascularity is normal without redistribution.
     There is no focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion seen.
     The stomach appears distended with air and particulate material (food). If
     the patient has not had a recent meal, this finding is suggestive of diabetic
     gastropathy, and clinical correlation is recommended.
     IMPRESSION:  No CHF or pneumonia.

     INDICATION:  46 year old male with end stage renal disease requiring catheter
     for hemodialysis.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the
     patient and informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the
     angiographic room and placed in supine position.
     
     The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7261**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6**], the
     attending radiologist, was present during the entire procedure.
     
     The neck was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.  At this
     point a time out was performed and proper identification of the patient and
     the procedure was performed.  Ultrasound was used to localize the right
     internal jugular vein.  This vein was found to be patent and compressible.
     Under ultrasound guidance, local anesthesia was achieved with approximately 4
     cc of 1% lidocaine.  The right internal jugular vein was entered under
     ultrasonographic guidance with a micropuncture needle.  A 0.018 guidewire was
     then advanced into the IVC using flouroscopic guidance.  A skin incision was
     made and a 4 French micropuncture catheter sheath was advanced.  At this
     point, the anterior chest wall was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine and a tunnel
     was created.  A 19 cm dialysis catheter was then introduced through the
     tunnel. At this point the 0.018 guidewire was exchanged for a 0.035 guidewire
     and the tract and the vein were dilated successfully up to 14.5 French.  The
     dialysis catheter sheath was introduced under the guidance of the wire.  The
     14.5 French dialysis catheter was then introduced through this sheath which
     was peeled away.  The position of the dialysis catheter was confirmed to be in
     the right atrium.  A final chest radiograph was obtained, demonstrating the
     tip of the catheter in the right atrium.  The incision in the right neck was
     closed with Dermabond and the catheter was secured to the skin using 0 silk
     sutures. A sterile dressing was then placed over the catheter exit site and
     the neck incision.  The catheter was flushed with heparin.  The patient
     tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of an 18 cm tip-to-cuff right IJ
     hemodialysis catheter.  The tip of the dialysis catheter is located in the
     right atrium.  The catheter is ready for use.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     laceration.  Rule out foreign body.  Rule out osteomyelitis.
     
     THREE VIEWS, LEFT FOOT:  When compared with prior study dated [**2879-2-13**],
     there has been no significant interval change.  Diffuse osteopenia, limiting
     evaluation for an acute fracture.  No acute fracture is identified.  There are
     destructive and proliferative changes within the mid foot, with increased
     density and disorganization in this region.  These findings are consistent
     with neuropathic osteoarthropathy.  Within the plantar surface of the heel,
     there is a soft tissue irregularity consistent with an ulcer.  The overlying
     bone is free of sinus tracts, or osteopenia.  These vascular calcifications
     are seen throughout the foot, consistent with diabetes.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Neuropathic changes of the left mid foot.  No evidence of acute
     fracture.  Vascular calcifications.
     
     These findings were discussed with the referring physician at the time of

     RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 9302**] [**Name (STitle) 9303**] with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6**] being present and supervising.
     
     CONSENT:  Risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient
     and written consent was obtained.
     
     PROCEDURE:  10 mL of 1% lidocaine was injected in the area around the right IJ
     tunneled catheter.  A 0.035 Amplatz wire was advanced through the existing
     hemodialysis catheter into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.
     With help of blunt dissection, the existing hemodialysis catheter was removed
     over the Amplatz wire.  A new 14 French 24-cm dialysis catheter was advanced
     over the guide wire through the right IJ into the proximal right atrium using
     fluoroscopic guidance. A final chest x-ray demonstrated the tip of the
     hemodialysis catheter to be in the proximal right atrium.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful exchange of a hemodialysis catheter with a 14 French
     24-cm cuff-to-tip length through the right IJ with tip in the proximal right
     atrium.  The line is ready for use.

     AP & LATERAL RADIOGRAPHS THE LEFT FOOT:  Comparison is made to [**2879-5-13**].
     Study is limited due to patient positioning ability.  No true lateral
     radiograph was able to be obtained.  A focal lucency is seen within the region
     of the calcaneal fat pad, which likely represents the patient's known ulcer.
     The ulcer tract does not appear to extend to bone radiographically.  No
     definite periosteal reaction is seen within the bone.  There is no osseous
     destruction.  Appearance of the neuropathic fragmentation and sclerosis in the
     mid foot is unchanged.  Again seen is diffuse vascular calcification.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Ulcer seen along the plantar fat pad.  No definite evidence of
     osteomyelitis.
