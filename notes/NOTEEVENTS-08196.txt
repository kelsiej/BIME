     INDICATION:  70-year-old man with constipation, change in mental status, for
     evaluation for sigmoid volvulus.
     
     COMPARISON:  Abdominal radiograph from [**2770-3-22**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung
     bases to the pubic symphysis with multiplanar reformatted images.
     
     CONTRAST:  Images were obtained with oral contrast only.  No intravenous
     contrast was administered secondary to worsening renal function.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN:  No pleural effusions, parenchymal consolidation, or
     pulmonary nodules are identified at the lung bases.  Minimal dependent
     atelectasis is seen bilaterally.  There are scattered coronary artery and
     aortic root/valve calcifications.
     
     There is limited evaluation of solid organs without intravenous contrast.
     Several coarse calcifications are seen within the liver and spleen from prior
     granulomatous infection.  The remainder of the non-contrast enhanced liver and
     spleen are normal in appearance.  The gallbladder is located in a ventral
     position, but is otherwise normal in appearance. The adrenal glands are
     normal. The pancreas is atrophic. Several densities are seen within the renal
     hila bilaterally, which likely reflect vascular calcifications, though small
     non- obstructing stones cannot be excluded.  There is heavy aortic
     calcification, without any evidence of aneurysmal dilatation. There is a small
     fat-containing umbilical hernia.
     
     No free air or free fluid is identified within the abdomen.  The bowel is
     normal, without any evidence of bowel wall thickening or dilatation.
     Specifically, the colon demonstrates normal caliber and contour throughout its
     course.  There is no evidence of pericolonic stranding. There is a very long
     redundant sigmoid colon, which likely explains the radiographic appearance.
                                                                 (Over)

     is decompressed.  No free fluid or pelvic lymphadenopathy seen.  The appendix
     is normal in appearance.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
     Degenerative changes are seen throughout the visualized lumbar and lower
     thoracic spine.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Multiplanar reconstructions were essential in delineating
     the anatomy and pathology.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No evidence of sigmoid volvulus.  The colon demonstrates normal caliber
     and wall thickness throughout its course.  There is a very long redundant
     sigmoid colon, which may explain the radiographic appearance.
     2.  Liver and splenic calcifications suggest prior granulomatous infection.
     3.  Densities within the renal hila bilaterally likely represent vascular
     calcifications, though small non-obstructing stones cannot be entirely
     excluded.

BKA (Right [**2770-2-25**]) and ESRD s/p LUE fistula [**2770-3-6**], recent 
admission for altered mental status presents with intermittent 
CP and SOB x 3 days. The patient is a poor historian. He 
describes the onset of palpitations 3 days ago, which on further 
history reports as substernal chest pain. Denies any radiation, 
SOB, nausea, or diaphoresis. The episode lasted 30-60 min and 
resolved. He had repeat episodes yesterday and then today when 
he was brought into the ED by his son. No cough, fever, chills, 
SOB, HA, nausea/vomiting. Continues to make urine, perhaps 
slightly increased amount recently but no dysuria.  
.  
Of note, the patient was recently admitted ([**Date range (1) 11311**]) for 
altered mental status thought to be multifactorial from 
medication confusion/noncompliance, severe hypertension at 
presentation, and vomiting/minimal po intake; his confusion 
improved prior to discharge. He also had bilious nausea/vomiting 
with KUB and CT abdomen/pelvis negative for obstruction that 
then resolved, hypertensive urgency, and isolated leukocytosis 
(WBC 17) without obvious signs for infection and therefore not 
treated.  
.  
In the ED, vitals: T 96.0 HR 84 BP 136/58 RR 16 SaO2 86 on RA -> 
97% on 4.5L. Noted to be tachypnea intermittently to RR 32. ECG 
nondiagnostic with LVH with repol changes, worsening ST 
depressions laterally and positive troponin but normal CK. ABG 
7.53/27/58; lactate 1.6; WBC 15.3; BNP[**MD Number 11312**]. CXR with ?left

Brief Hospital Course:
70 y/o M with PMHx of DM, CRI, CAD, PVD s/p b/l BKA who was 
initially admitted on [**2770-4-2**] for NSTEMI and CHF that was later 
felt to be due to demand ischemia from CHF rather than plaque 
rupture. While on the floor was refusing lab draws and 
echocardiogram to assess resolution of NSTEMI. His hospital 
course was then complicated by 2 embolic strokes on [**4-6**] (R 
parietal and L frontal lesion) which caused him to become 
aphasic and develop R sided weakness. He did not receive any 
thrombolysis, and coumadin was held as felt risk on 
anticoagulation outwayed the benefits. He has ESRD but not 
getting dialysis yet as making urine, has a working fistula on R 
arm. On [**4-12**] he was intubated and transfered to the ICU for 
Urosepsis. He was treated with Meropenem, extubated, and 
transfered out of the ICU and back to the medical floor. While 
in the ICU a double lumen PICC was placed.  
.  
On the medical floor a PEG tube was placed and dispo planning 
was in process until [**2770-4-25**] AM when he was found to be grunting 
and coughing. At that time Lasix was given for fluid overload 
and enzymes were cycled. His EKG showed suggestion of anterior 
STEMI with no reciprocal changes, cardiology evaluated this and 
felt it was most likely a NSTEMI. They felt that no further 
intervention was warented. His troponin bumped to 1.49 and then 
2.75 without an increase in his MB fraction. He was started on 
Heparin for anticoagulation.  
.  
At 6:30 AM on [**2770-4-26**] a trigger was called for hypoxia and 
tachypnia. Per the vitals sheet her O2 sat had dropped at 4:30AM 
to 80s however he was due for transfusion which was started and 
respiratory status worsened. The blood transfusion was stopped 
and he was placed on 100% on shovel mask with sats recorded at 
86%, he was then placed on NRB with sats up to 97%. He was given 
100mg Lasix and 500mg Diurel. He was then transfered to FICU for 
management of pulmonary edema.  
.
On the evening of [**2770-4-26**] he again developed acute respiratory 
failure.  He was intubated.  A family meeting was held [**4-27**], and 
the decision was made to make the patient DNR, and to not pursue 
any further escalation of care (no pressors, no dialysis).  A 
seconde family meeting was held on [**4-29**], and the decision was 
made to make the patient comfort measures only.  He was 
extubated in the evening of 6/6.  He died at 0600 on [**2770-4-30**].  
His son, [**Doctor Last Name **], was contacted at the time of death.

     INDICATION:  Plavix.  Fall.  Mental status changes.  Inability to speak. Right
     upper extremity weakness.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  A non-contrast head CT was performed.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no intracranial hemorrhage.  There is no midline shift,
     mass effect or hydrocephalus.  There are periventricular white matter
     hypodensities, most consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
     More wedge-like region of hypodensity in the region of the right parietal lobe
     is felt to represent a subacute infarct.  A small, more subtle area of
     hypodensity is noted in the left frontal lobe.  This could represent a more
     acute infarct.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3499**] was contacted with these findings at the time of
     dictation. MRI is recommended if further evaluation is clinically warranted.
     
     There is no intracranial hemorrhage.
     
     No fractures are noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:  
     
     Subacute infarct in the right parietal lobe.  There is also a subtle hypodense
     region in the posterior left frontal lobe, which could be better evaluated at
     that time also, as it may indicate an early infarct.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE.
     
     REASON:  Stroke.
     
     FINDINGS:  Duplex evaluation was performed of both carotid arteries.  Minimal
     plaque is identified.
     
     On the right, peak systolic velocities are 100, 112, 109 in the ICA, CCA, ECA
     respectively.  The ICA/CCA ratio is 0.9.  This is consistent with less than
     40% stenosis.
     
     On the left, peak systolic velocities are 90, 99, 106 in the ICA, CCA, and ECA
     respectively.  The ICA/CCA ratio is 0.9.  This is consistent with less than
     40% stenosis.  Antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.
     
     Although there are no elevated velocities in the carotid artery, both sides
     show diminished diastolic flow, especially on the left.  This may be
     consistent with intracranial carotid disease.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40% cervical internal
     carotid artery stenosis.  However, waveforms as described above may indicate
     more distal intracranial carotid disease.  Clinical correlation and potential
     further evaluation is warranted.

     The right PICC line was  repositioned with its tip now terminating at least 1
     cm below the cavoatrial junction at the level of eighth thoracic vertebra. The
     NG tube tip is still terminating to proximal at the gastroesophageal junction.
     The ETT tube position is also unchanged, 6.3 cm above the carina with neck
     in partly flexed position, and might be advanced 2 cm for more standard
     positioning. The left retrocardiac consolidation has been slightly improved.
     These findings were discussed with the IV nurse at the time of dictation.

     Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed.  The right PICC line continues into
     the right internal jugular vein, going up with its tip terminating above the
     upper limit of the chest film most likely within the skull.  The ET tube tip
     is 6 cm above the carina but given the flexion of the neck, might be advanced
     for at least 2 cm.  The NG tube tip terminates proximal at the cavoatrial
     junction with the sidehole situated in the mid esophagus.  The left
     retrocardiac consolidation is grossly unchanged.  No sizeable pleural effusion
     is identified.

     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  Study is limited by motion.  The areas of infarction in the left
     frontal and right parietal lobes are slightly more hypodense compared to the
     previous study, consistent with continued evolution of infarction.  The
     ventricles are stable in size and configuration.  There is no evidence of
     acute intracranial hemorrhage.  There is opacification of right posterior
     ethmoid air cells, also noted on the previous CT scan.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Continued evolution of left frontal and right parietal
     infarction, with no evidence of hemorrhage.

     A single AP view of the chest was obtained [**2770-4-19**] at 17:10 hours and compared
     with the prior radiograph performed the prior day.  The Dobbhoff tube has been
     advanced and its tip now projects over the expected location of the gastric
     body.  Minimal subsegmental atelectasis seen at the left base.  There is a
     right-sided PICC line with its tip unchanged in position from the prior
     examination and likely in the mid SVC.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Further advancement of Dobbhoff tube with the tip in the gastric body.  It
     still needs to be advanced for optimal placement.

     HISTORY:  Status post CVA with increasing somnolence.  Rule out intracranial
     hemorrhage.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT scan.
     
     PRELIMINARY REPORT:  ""No bleed or other acute process.  No significant
     interval change.""  This report was issued by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 5064**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3928**] at 2:30 a.m.,
     on [**2770-4-22**].
     
     PRIOR REPORT:  ""Continued evolution of left frontal and right parietal
     infarction, with no evidence of hemorrhage"", reported by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 5684**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 322**]
     on [**2770-4-17**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There has been no definite interval change in the appearance of the
     brain compared to the prior study.  Specifically, the left frontal-temporal
     and right temporal-parietal infarcts are redemonstrated, without evidence of
     hemorrhagic transformation.  There is no other new intracranial abnormality
     discerned.  There is continued demonstration of focal opacification by soft
     tissue density of the most posterior right ethmoid sinus air cell, with a
     slight amount of marginal sclerosis suggesting that the abnormality could be a
     reflection of chronic inflammatory sinus disease in this locale.
     
     CONCLUSION:  No evidence of hemorrhagic transformation of previously
     identified infarcts, as noted above.

     This is a 70-year-old gentleman who is status post non-ST-segment elevation
     myocardial infarction with an acute CVA and urosepsis.  The patient is aphasic
     and cannot swallow.  He is unable to tolerate a nasogastric tube for long-term
     therefore the request was made to place a gastrojejunostomy tube.
     
     Informed consent was obtained from the wife.  The patient was brought to the
     interventional suite and the abdomen prepped.  The nasogastric tube was
     insufflated with air and three punctures were made for tie tacks to secure the
     stomach to the internal abdominal wall.  The stomach was then entered and a
     guidewire passed into the ampullary area followed by an Omni Sos catheter to
     access the pyloric canal.  The wire was passed into the duodenum past the
     ligament of Treitz over which a 14-French [**Doctor Last Name 936**] was passed through a peel-
     away sheath.  The pigtail was coiled in the duodenum in excellent position.
     There was no immediate complication.
     
     MODERATE SEDATION was provided by administering divided doses of 50 mcg of
     Fentanyl and 1 mg of Versed throughout the intraservice time of 30 minutes
     during which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Status post gastrojejunostomy with tip of the feeding tube distal
     to the ligament of Treitz.

70y.o. portuguese speaking male transferred from 11R today for increased resp distress, new NSTEMI, possible intubation.

PMH: CAD, CVA, IDDM, MI, PVD s/p bilateral BKA, ESRD with left AV fistula in place but has not received dialysis as yet, This admission has had CVA and MI already. Pt has PEG in place. Pt also has PICC right upper extremity

Allergies: NKA

Pt has had increased Resp distress noted in past 24hrs while on 11R and CPK/troponins indicated new NSTEMI. CXR showed worsening pulmonary edema and possible aspiration PNA. Pt's urine output low and he has not responded well to lasix/diuril doses on floor. Transfers to MICU for possible intubation/possible dialysis. Cardiology does not have any intervention to offer him at this time. He transfers to MICU on heparin drip at 910u/hr and NTG drip at 3 drops.

Arrives moaning in bed slightly distressed resp status. Good sat on 100% NRB. Weaning down at present. He has large sacral decubitus ulcer which is black and unstagable. Kinaire bed ordered. Family aware of transfer.

Neuro: Pt non-verbal at baseline. Stiff to move in bed. Moans at times.

CV: BP 110-120/50. HR 90's NSR with APC's. Labs sent are pnd. Initial PTT was 101 so heparing drip dropped to 700u/hr and repeat PTT needs to be drawn at 5PM. Getting BP in lower right arm. NTG on. Pt received 100mg lasix and 500mg IV diuril prior to transfer to MICU and will hopefully respond to this. Renal may opt for dialysis later today.

Resp: Lungs clear w/deminished sounds at bases. RR 24-36 ABG pnd. 

GI: Has PEG in place and is having diarrhea. Pt is getting banana flakes via PEG TID. Tube feeds full strength renal goal is 40cc/hr.

GU: Foley in place draining small amts yellow urine with sediment.

ID: afebrile on transfer.

Skin: Needs Kinaire bed. Has large sacral decubitus. Needs to be seen by skin care/wound nurse.

Social: Pt's family is Portuguese speaking. Son [**Name (NI) **] is proxy [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5498**]

Access: PICC in right upper extemity is double lumen. Working well.

MICU NPN Addendum to admit note:
Still awaiting arrival of Kinaire bed to unit. Renalk has come by and decision to use lasix/diuris tonight and hold of dialysis for now. UO ranging 40-60/hr. May need another large lasix dose followed by diuril this evening.

BP 100-120/50 HR 80's after getting dose of lopressor 50mg PO. His dose ordered is 100mg but since BP boarderline I gave him only 50mg and BP dropped from 110-90's. The rest of the dose of lopressor held. Continue on NTG drip increased to 6gtt. Heparin drip rate dropped to 700u/hr at 11AM. Please send repeat labs at 5PM along with his PM labs ordered.

ABG on 40% cool neb was 75/20/7.50 showing a combined resp alkalosis and metabolic acidosis. FIO2 increased to 70% CN and will watch closely. RR continues to be 30's.

Team is watching his temp curse as his WBC has climbed up to 22.3 today. Pt is ordered for echo to check for endocarditis. No antibiotics for now.

Plan: Continue diuresis. Follow resp status, he still looks tenuous and may need intubation if family wants to continue aggressive care. Follow temp closely and notify team of any spike. Please send PM labs as ordered. Follow PTT Q6hr while on heparin.

     Pt is a 70 yo male, who arrived in the MICU earlier in the day after having respiratory distress on the floor.  

Review of systems:

Resp:  Received pt on 100% CN with RR in the low 20's.  LS were course, NT sxn'd ~1600, for thick tan secretions.  Approx 1845, pt having increasing resp distress after a drop in BP required the NTG to be turned off.  LS coarse with scattered rales at that time.  Ordered and received 100mg IV lasix followed by 500 mg IV Diuril.  Fair urine response.   Placed on masked ventilation, with noted improvement.

CV:  CPK's resent at 1900, increased to 1462 with MB 23.  HR has been in the 70's-90's, 100's with distress.  Difficulty with monitoring BP acurately.  Had been monitoring BP on right wrist, becoming bypotensive to the 70's/, Rechecked in the left arm:  125/, unable to con't monitoring BP in this extremity due to A-V fistula.  Right upper arm has a PICC line and BLE a BP was undetectable.  Team notified, and A-line placed for continued monitoring.  NTG restarted ~2000 after being shut off for hypotension, currently infusing at 6gtts/hr, .56 mcg/kg/hr.  Heparin infusing at 700units/hr.  PTT checked ~51, no changes made.

GU:  Fair response to the lasix and diuril.  Amts recorded in carevue. Foley intact, draining clear yellow urine.

GI:  +BS, 3 stools this shift.  Sent off for C-Diff culture.  TF's stopped during resp distress episode.  Con'ts off during masked ventilation.  Will need to reassess later prior to restarting.  Had been infusing at 20cc/hr.  Goal is 40cc/hr.

Skin:  BUE edema.  Sacral decub cleansed per protocol.  Awaiting skin care consult tomorrow.  Incontinent of stool times 3.  Difficult to keep area clean.  Checked and turned frequently.

Social:  No contact from family this shift.

Neuro:  Pt responds to tactile stimuli, but does not visually track.  He will squeeze left hand, but not on command.  Does not appear to move RUE, moves RLE and LLE.

ID:  Afeb at present.  No antibiotic coverage at this time.  Sputum and stool sent this shift.

Lines:  new A-line in right radial, PICC in RUE.

NPN

Neuro:  Pt sometimes found with his eyes open, does not appear to track, at times he is lethargic, remains on a fent gtt, this has not been increased and remains at 75 mcg/hr.

CV:  Conts on the hep gtt at 700 units/hr, last PTT was 39.5 and his rate was not increased because he has repeatedly needed to have his gtt rate decreased or stopped on the same rate.  His BP has been stable 110-120s, off of pressures and NTG gtt, his BP has not been high enough to tolerate the lopressor.

Resp:  Remains vented, no changes were made on the vent, LS coarse.

GI:  TF were restarted at 10cc/hr with a goal rate of 40cc/hr, babnanaflakes cont, he has not had any stool this shift.

GU:  His urine remains light in color, u/o has been 20-40cc/hr, no further diuretics have been given.  Renal saw him today and said that he is not a cadidate for dialysis.

Skin:  He remains on a kinair matress for his unstagable decube.  it conts to have some areas of blackened skin as well as red raw area that tend to bleed.  Conts with the skin care oint and turning.

Soc:  His wife and son were in this morning, they were told that he was not doing very well overall, a family meeting occured with ethics, an interpreter, MICU attending, nursing and his wife and son.  It was decided that comfort would be our primary goal, that we would not escalate care, would not add back pressures, his son was ready to withdraw the vent but his wife was not and asked for a little more time.
