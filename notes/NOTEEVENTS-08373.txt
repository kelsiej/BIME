None

 
History of Present Illness:
This is an 83 y/o female with moderate AS, s/p MVR [**39**] years ago, 
s/p PPM, DM, CHF, p/w dsypnea and increased work of breathing x 
4-5 days. Per family, the patient has had worsening CHF/volume 
overload over the last several weeks, requiring supplemental O2 
at rehab. Over the last few days, she has been noted to be more 
short of breath and having sats to 60% on RA. Her lasix was 
increased to 60 mg bid. Beginning today, she was noted to be in 
hypoxic respiratory distress, 87-91% on 2L/NC. She was increased 
to 5L, with her sats going up to 97%. She was also noted to be 
more confused over the last few days and especially today. She 
was given lasix and 2 mg IV morphine at [**Hospital 67**] Rehab, and sent 
to [**Hospital1 83**] for further evaluation. En route, she was given 
additional lasix of 60 mg IV and nitro spray x 2.  
.  
In the ED, her VS were Tc 97.2, BP 146/25, HR 70, RR 27, SaO2 
95%/NRB. Foley was placed in ED. She was given 40 mg IV lasix 
and 325 mg ASA. She was placed on BiPAP for comfort at 30% FiO2, 
5 PEEP, 12 PS. Admitted to the MICU for further management.  
.  
Per family, besides the dyspnea and SOB, the patient has had no 
other symptoms, including f/c/s, CP, palpitations, abd pain, 
n/v/diarrhea. She has had decreased appetite over the last few 
days in the context of increasing confusion.

.
Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric 
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size 
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal 
(LVEF 70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right 
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular 
cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic function appears 
depressed. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are focal 
calcifications in the aortic arch. There are three aortic valve 
leaflets. The aortic valve  leaflets are moderately thickened. 
There is at least moderate aortic valve  stenosis. A bileaflet 
mitral valve prosthesis is present. The gradients are higher 
than expected for this type of prosthesis. The tricuspid valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic pulmonic 
regurgitation velocity is increased  suggesting pulmonary artery 
diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial  
effusion. Compared with the findings of the prior study (images 
reviewed) of [**3026-3-21**], the pressure gradient across the 
mitral valve prosthesis is increased.  
.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**5-2**] through 26: Mild 
pulmonary edema is unchanged. Bilateral pleural effusion small 
on the right and moderate on the left is stable. Severe 
cardiomegaly and left lower lobe atelectasis unchanged. No 
pneumothorax. Transvenous right ventricular pacer lead in 
standard placement.
.
ECG: Ventricular paced rhythm. Compared to the previous tracing 
of [**3027-5-2**] no significant change.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P - 83yo F with valvular disorder, AF, and h/o CAD a/w 
hypercarbic respiratory failure. 
.
# Respiratory failure- She was admitted to the MICU for her 
repiratory failure which was thought to be secondary to CHF.  Pt 
was diuresed with iv lasix/acetazolamide and given iv 
morphine/prn for respiratory distress and BIPAP was tried.  
However, hypercarbia ([**1-12**] metabolic alkalosis) remained in the 
90s.  Pt was mentating okay, having conversations with 
intermittent somnolence despite hypercarbia.  TTE showed 
preserved EF with moderate AS and moderate MS and mod pulm HTN.  
Cardiology was consulted and thought MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 11605**] to her 
pulm edema and pulm HTN.  Cardiology recommended d/cing digoxin 
and starting amiodarone.  Family declined valvuloplasty.  For 
possible COPD, pt was started on steroids and nebs on [**5-6**].  Pt 
is currently satting 90s on 1 L NC while sitting in a chair but 
needs more O2 when supine.  Pt is a mouth breather and 
occasionally needs a face mask.  Pt will need I/Os monitored to 
goal even to slightly negative as she was diursed 4.8 L during 
her MICU stay.  Depending on her I/O, lasix and acetazolamide 
can be decreased or discontinued.  If she were to decompensate 
at the rehab, goals of care will need to be readdressed.  
.
# h/o CAD - There were new changes on EKG but pt was ruled out 
with 3 sets of negative cardiac enzymes.  Pt was continued on 
BB, ASA, and nitrates. 
.
# Acid/base status - Respiratory acidosis with metabolic 
compensation. Appears to be chronic in nature given degree of 
metabolic compensation with acute component earlier today.  Pt 
failed BIPAP and pCO2 remained in the 90s but maintaining 
mentation.   
.
# Renal insufficiency - baseline Cr unknown, may have CRI from 
DM.  Creatinine stayed stable from 1.3-1.5.  Will need to 
renally dose all medications. 
.
# A fib - continued BB.  Per cardiology consult recs, 
discontinued digoxin and started amiodarone.  Due to elevated 
INR, coumadin was held.  Pt is also paced.  Pt needs to be on 
amiodarone 400mg BID x 7 days (loading dose) and then 400mg 
daily for maintenance. 
.
# DM - insulin standing + HISS, FS qid
.
# Depression - continuedhome regimen
.
# F/E/N - NPO initially while on BIPAP and now low sodium 
cardiac diet. 
.
# PPx - supratherpeutic INR
.
# Access - PIV
.
# Code - DNR/DNI. No pressors or central line per HCP. If she 
were to decompensate at the rehab, goals of care will need to be 
readressed.
