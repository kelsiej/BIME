Admission Date:  [**3226-2-5**]       Discharge Date:

Date of Birth:                    Sex:  M

Service:  Trauma Surgery.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79-year-old male who
fell 15 feet off a ladder.  He presented as a trauma alert as
part of a trauma transfer from an outside facility.  At the
scene, reportedly, he was unresponsive.  The patient was
intubated and presented to an outside hospital.  A CT at the
outside hospital demonstrated a depressed skull fracture and
a large subdural hematoma.  The patient was transferred to
[**Hospital1 75**] for definitive
treatment.  The patient was hemodynamically stable throughout
transfer.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient's past medical history is
significant for hypercholesterolemia and prostate cancer.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  The patient has no known past
surgical history.

MEDICATIONS:  His only medication is Lipitor.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon arrival, the patient was
hypothermic with a temperature of 96.2, blood pressure
123/65, heart rate 54.  He was intubated and saturating 100
percent.  On exam, his left pupil was 4 mm and nonreactive.
The right pupil was 2 mm and sluggishly reactive.  On exam,
the patient was intubated, collared.  Chest exam revealed no
obvious sign of injury, no stepoff, no crepitus.  He had
equal breath sounds bilaterally.  The trachea was in the
midline.  Cardiovascularly, his rate and rhythm were regular.
His abdomen was soft, nontender.  The pelvis was stable.  The
extremities demonstrated no obvious bony injuries, and he had
bilaterally palpable pulses in all extremities.  The rectal
exam demonstrated weak tone.  On log roll, the patient
demonstrated no stepoffs or hematomas of the back.

LABORATORY DATA:  CT scan from the outside hospital
demonstrated a large subdural hematoma, frontal contusion,
and a large occipital skull fracture.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  An urgent neurosurgical consultation was
obtained at which point the neurosurgeons determined that the
patient's status was critical, and he should transferred
immediately to the operating room.  The patient underwent an
emergent left craniotomy with evacuation of a subdural
hematoma and release of intracranial pressure.
Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit.

Upon transfer, the patient was noted to be completely
unresponsive with fixed and dilated pupils.  An urgent family
meeting was undertaken with the neurosurgical team and the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit team along with the trauma
surgeons, and the patient was given a ""Do Not Resuscitate""
order.  Neurologically, at that time, he had fixed and
dilated pupils and no gag or corneal reflexes.  His apnea
test was negative for any spontaneous respiratory activity.

A second family meeting was undertaken in the presence of the
neurosurgical team, the trauma team, and the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit team, at which time the patient's grim
diagnosis was discussed, and the mutual decision was made to
withdraw care.  Care was withdrawn, and the patient expired
at 01:00 on [**3226-2-16**].
