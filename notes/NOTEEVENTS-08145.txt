IMAGING:

Admission CXR [**1-30**]: IMPRESSION: Resolving right lower lobe 
pneumonia. Persistent left lower lobe opacity.

Repeat CXR [**2-1**]: FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been 
obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Apparently a 
very poor inspirational effort accounts for the high positioned 
diaphragms resulting in markedly crowded appearance of the 
pulmonary vasculature on the bases. In the accessible mid lung 
fields in apical areas, there is no evidence of any vascular 
congestion nor is there any acute infiltrate or pneumothorax. 
Available for comparison is a previous similar portable 
examination of [**2721-1-30**] at which time the patient makes 
a significant better inspiration with clear diaphragms but a 
persistent left lower lobe opacity unchanged since the next 
previous examination of [**12-30**]. It was also felt that there 
existed some densities in the right lower lobe which were 
interpreted as resolving opacities.

The present examination cannot make any statements regarding 
these basal findings because of the patient's poor inspirational 
effort. It is recommended the portable examination is repeated 
if possible by adding also a lateral view.

EGD [**1-30**]:
Findings: Esophagus:  
 Lumen: A large size hiatal hernia was seen.  
 Protruding Lesions There were 2 cords of grade II varices at 
the gastroesophageal junction and lower third of the esophagus. 
They were not actively bleeding. There was no stigmata of recent 
bleeding, however due to the patient's hypotension and Hct of 18 
on presentation, ligation was performed. 2 bands were 
successfully placed.  
Stomach:  
 Mucosa: Mosaic appearance of the mucosa with no bleeding was 
noted in the whole stomach. These findings are compatible with 
portal gastropathy. There was no active bleeding in the stomach. 
 
Duodenum: Normal duodenum. 
Impression: Large hiatal hernia
Mosaic appearance in the whole stomach compatible with portal 
gastropathy
Varices at the gastroesophageal junction and lower third of the 
esophagus. 

No active bleeding in stomach or esophagus.

Due to Hct drop and hypotension on admission, 2 bands were 
placed on the esophageal variceal cords.
 
Recommendations: Can take sips of clears for dinner tonight. If 
Hct remains stable on next blood draw, OK to leave ICU to floor.
Continue pantoprazole, octreotide. Hold nadolol for now.
Follow serial Hct.
Repeat EGD in 2 weeks with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3885**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] 
[**Name (STitle) 8641**]. Call ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 6413**] to schedule. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
55 yo F with h/o cirrhosis secondary to EtOH abuse c/b varices,  

no h/o SBP, h/o recurrent C. Diff colitis, and depression/PTSD 
presented with melena.
.  
# GI bleed. The patient was scoped in the ED by the liver 
service. Received 5 units PRBC's and 2 units FFP.  She was 
banded in the ED and sent to the ICU for monitoring.  Octreotide 
drip was initiated and continued for 5 days.  PPI IV was given 
(GTT -> BID -> QD).  Nadolol was initiated in setting of 
hypertension and GIB.  The pt initially had a groin cordis 
placed in the ED for volume as access was difficult.  EJ was 
placed and the cordis was removed.  HCT remained stable 
thereafter.  The patient no longer required ICU level care after 
HD #2, however no floor beds were available.  The pt remained in 
the ICU for the remainder of her hospitalization and was 
discharged home with stable HCT in stable condition with no sign 
of bleeding with VNA and f/u instructions.
.  
# EtOH cirrhosis. Received 2 units of FFP on arrival.  
Thereafter she received no more.  She was started on CIWA 
precautions, but received no PRN benzos because she showed no 
signs of withdrawal.
.  
# Hypercholemic metabolic acidosis likely secondary to 4 liters 
of NS.  
- This resolved once pt was fluid resuscitated and IVF was 
d/c'd.
.  
# Recurrent C. diff  
- Pt positive for c-diff at this hospitalization.  Outpt 
physician stated that pt did not tolerate PO vanc in past 
(recurrant C dif has been a difficult problem).  Pt was started 
on Flagyl.  
.  
# MRSA in Urine culture  
- No need for treatment as it is 10,000 to 100,000 colonies.  At 
the time of discharge, there was a repeat Urine Culture PENDING. 

.
# NO h/o SBP. Levoflox x5 days, then no prophylaxis was 
continued.
.  
# Depression. Continued Paxil  
.  
# FEN. The patient was NPO until 2 days after her EGD.  She was 
then advanced to clears and advanced to full diet.
.  
# PPX. No SC heparin was given, pneumoboots were used, as was a 
PPI bid.  IV access was difficult.  The pt was given and EJ 
temporarily as peripheral access was too difficult.
.  
# Code: Full Code at this hospital stay.

     DUPLEX ULTRASOUND OF THE LIVER AND ITS VASCULATURE.
     
     INDICATION:  Patient with cirrhosis.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Grayscale, color flow and pulse wave Doppler insonation of the
     liver and its vasculature was performed.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2721-2-15**].
     
     REPORT:
     The liver appears somewhat cirrhotic in appearance.  Color flow and pulse wave
     Doppler insonation of the liver and its vessels show evidence of hepatopetal
     flow within the liver, with reversal within the main and left portal vein. The
     portal vein remains patent.  The main hepatic artery, right hepatic artery,
     right hepatic vein, middle hepatic vein, left hepatic vein and left portal
     vein are also all shown to be patent.
     
     Again demonstrated is a moderate amount of ascites.
     
     The IVC is patent.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     Appearances are consistent with hepatopetal flow secondary to portal
     hypertension in a cirrhotic liver.

     INDICATION:  Patient with cirrhosis, poor IV access, needing occasional blood

     PROCEDURE:  This procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 525**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 41**], with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 6**], the Attending Radiologist, being present and supervising throughout.
     The left upper arm was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  As a
     suitable vein was not found on visual inspection, ultrasound was used to
     identify the left brachial vein, which was patent and compressible.  After
     administration of approximately 5 ml of subcutaneous lidocaine for anesthesia,
     the left brachial vein was accessed via a 21-gauge needle and a 0.018
     guidewire advanced through it.  Hard copy ultrasound images document the vein
     before and after establishing access.  The guidewire was advanced under
     fluoroscopic guidance into the superior vena cava.  The needle was exchanged
     for a 4-French introducer sheath.  Based on the markers on the guidewire, a 40
     cm length was deemed appropriate.  The PICC was trimmed to length and advanced
     over the wire and introducer sheath into the superior vena cava.  The wire and
     sheath were removed and the line flushed, heplocked, and statlocked.  A final
     fluoroscopic image demonstrates the tip of the catheter at the SVC/RA
     junction.  The line is ready for use.

     The previously identified left lung atelectasis has been markedly improved. 
     There is continued minimal patchy atelectasis in the left lung base.  The
     possibility of pneumonia cannot be excluded.
     
     The lung volume is small.  There is continued mild pulmonary edema.  The heart
     is normal in size.  The tip of the endotracheal tube is identified 3 cm above
     the carina.  The left-sided PICC line is terminating in the right innominate
     vein, which has to be corrected.
     
     The nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
         55 year old woman with cirrhosis and increasing LFTs Please do US  c doppler 
      to look for thrombus in kidneys and liver
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      R/o thrombus in hepatic portal system and renal vascualture                     
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     STUDY:  Duplex ultrasound of liver.
     
     INDICATION:  Patient with advanced cirrhosis and elevated LFTs.  Rule out
     thrombus in kidney or portal vein.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Grayscale, color flow and pulse wave Doppler insonation of the
     hepatic parenchyma and vasculature was performed.
     
     COMPARISON:  Reference is made to examination from [**2721-2-17**].
     
     REPORT:
     
     Again the liver parenchyma is somewhat coarsened consistent with cirrhosis.
     The gallbladder is relaxed, but there is gallbladder wall thickening and
     sludge within the gallbladder, both likely reflecting background chronic liver
     disease.  The patient has moderate ascites.  No intra- or extra-hepatic
     biliary dilatation.  The portal vein is patent, but again demonstrates
     hepatopetal flow.  This is identified in the anterior branch of the right
     portal vein and the left portal vein also.  The hepatic veins are patent and
     normal waveforms are returned from right middle and left hepatic veins.  The
     hepatic arteries are similarly patent.  Kidneys are normal size, shape, and
     echogenicity.  Symmetrical flow is identified to both kidneys.  No evidence of
     renal vein thrombus identified on either side.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Cirrhosis with portal hypertension as described.  No evidence of
     renal or hepatic vein thrombus.

     PORTABLE CHEST:  Comparison with examination of the same day, 12:36 p.m.  The
     endotracheal tube is in good position.  A right-sided IJ central venous line
     is seen with its tip at the cavoatrial junction.  The left PICC is again seen
     with its tip in the right brachiocephalic vein.  There is unchanged
     cardiomegaly and low lung volumes, with fluffy opacities at both lung bases,
     suggesting pneumonia versus aspiration pneumonia.  There is a nasogastric tube
     with its tip in the stomach.  Bony structures are unchanged.

     INDICATION:  55-year-old woman with PICC line malposition.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: This procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1931**] with
     Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 79**] [**Name (STitle) 43**] d'Othee, the Attending Radiologist, being present and
     supervising throughout. The left upper extremity was prepped and draped in the
     usual sterile fashion. Fluoroscopy was used to confirm that the PICC line tip
     had flipped superiorly likely within the innominate vein.  Under fluoroscopic
     guidance, a 0.018 Nitinol wire was advanced and used to reposition the PICC
     line placing its tip at the atriocaval junction. Due to the somewhat tortuous
     and anomalous course of the central veins and possibility of the PICC line tip
     again flipping superiorly, the tip was placed deep at the atriocaval junction.
     The guide wire was removed and a single final fluoroscopic image was used to
     confirm and document tip placement.  PICC line was flushed, stat locked, and
     heplocked. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate
     complications.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful repositioning of left-sided PICC line with its tip now
     at the atriocaval junction; line is ready for use.
