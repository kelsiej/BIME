History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6044**] is a 77 year old male with depressed LV function and 
ESRD on dialysis who presented to [**Hospital3 341**] on [**5-24**] with 
witnessed syncope at dialysis. CPR was administered; from vague 
report, it sounds as though he had an AED placed but was not in 
shockable rhythm. He was admitted to [**Hospital3 1942**] and 
continued to have runs of VT so transferred here for ICD. On 
[**5-26**], he was noted to have a 12 beat run of NSVT. He has been 
referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for ICD placement. Of note, he was 
dialyzed on Tues and WED this week so did not have dialysis 
today, Thurs, one of his normal dialysis days. He was 
transferred for ICD placement. On arrival to [**Hospital1 83**], he was noted 
to be hypoxic with RA sats in low 80's, pleural effusion on 
right crackles on left, JVP up.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2838-5-31**] demonstrated:  
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is  
11-15mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy 
with normal cavity size with moderate global hypokinesis. 
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.The right 
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Right ventricular systolic 
function is normal. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic 
function is likely more depressed given the severity of 
tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets are 
moderately thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient 
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid 
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  
.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
moderate global hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin, 
metabolic; cannot fully exclude multivessel CAD but less 
likely). Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 
Minimal aortic valve stenosis.  
Compared with the prior report (images unavailable for review) 
of [**2830-9-30**], minimal aortic valve stenosis, symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy, and pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension are now identified. Global left ventricular 
systolic function appears similar. In the absence of a history 
of hypertension, the presence of symmetric hypertrophy raises 
the possibility of an infiltrative process (e.g., amyloid).  
.
CHEST CT ([**2838-5-31**]):  
1. Multiple dense masses within complex large right effusion are 
atypical in appearance for pleural tumor, more likely hematoma, 
but malignancy is still the top diagnostic consideration. A 
change in position with prone imaging would favor hematoma. If 
not, transthoracic needle aspiration is indicated, and should be 
feasible, for presumed mass.  
2. Right middle and lower bronchial occlusion with possible 
occlusive mass. Evaluation with contrast by CT (or MR if patient 
cannot tolerate iodinated contrast) would be helpful.  
3. Bilateral airspace consolidation, pneumonia or atelectasis.  
4. Small volume of ascites.  
.
CAROTID U/S ([**2838-5-31**]):  
1. Left ICA - 100% occlusion  
2. Right ICA - 40-59% occlusion  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 77 year old male with CAD s/p 5v CABG, ICM with 
depressed LV function EF 30%, ESRD on HD, atrial fibrillation, 
CHB s/p PPM, initially transferred for ? ICD placement, found to 
be in pulseless arrest and transferred to the CCU 
post-resuscitation. Patient remains intubated and workup of 
intrapulmonary issues are underway. Patient has collapsed right 
lung with possible mass vs. hematoma, now s/p VATS and chest 
tube placement.  
.  
1. PEA Arrest:  Initially presented to [**Hospital1 83**] for possible ICD 
placement.  While in-house, had PEA arrest with possible 
respiratory etiology. Telemetry showed inability of PPM to 
capture during code possibly due to metabolic derangement vs. 
pacer lead dislodgement. EP interrogated pacer and believes lead 
is in place - increased voltage that pacer lead is putting out.  
During the code, the patient was intubated. Patient remained 
intubated for a prolonged period but with improved mental status 
when off sedation. Neurology signed off. He was continued on 
amiodarone for h/o VT. He will continue on 400 mg of amiodarone 
for 1 more week then decrease to 200 mg daily thereafter.  
.  
2. Hypotension: This was initially felt likely secondary to 
aspiration pneumonia/hospital acquired pneumonia for he 
completed a course of antibiotics.  Over the course of his 
hospital stay, he had persistent pressor requirements.  
Ultimately this was felt to be due to a combination of poor 
inotropy from his cardiomyopathy and from poor peripheral 
vascular tone from his diabetes and renal failure.  For this 
combination, he was started on digoxin and midodrine with 
adequate stablization of his blood pressures.
.  
3. Respiratory failure:  
Admitted s/p respiratory arrest c/b PEA. Unclear whether initial 
respiratory event precipitated his cardiac arrest. Etiology 
likely multifactorial including baseline COPD, large R pleural 
effusion, collapsed R lung due to possible lung mass. 
Bronchoscopy unable to obtain tissue for diagnosis. Now s/p 
VATS, tissue biopsy on [**6-8**]. VATS revealed thickened parietal 
pleura and dense fibrothorax. Within dense fibrothorax there was 
400cc of old blood which was evacuated. Gram stain negative, 
biopsies sent to path, cytology and micro. He completed rx with 
Vanco/Zosyn x 14 days for post obstructive/aspiration pneumonia. 
He was kept intubated for a prolonged period because of 
overbreathing each time an SBT has been performed. After the 
VATS, he was tolerating PS 18/5. Pulmonary was also consulted at 
this point and performed another SBT which the patient tolerated 
with improvement in his ABG.  At this point a decision was made 
to extubate the patient on [**6-10**].  He tolerated the extubation 
initially, however after 2 hours he became progressively more 
tachypneic and hypoxic with Os sats 90% on 100% oxygen.  ABG at 
this time revealed a significant respiratory acidosis and the 
patient required reintubation.  Given his primary medical issues 
were pulmonary in nature it was felt that transfering the 
patient to the MICU service would be more appropriate. The 
patient underwent tracheostomy and was able to begin gradually 
weaning from the ventilator. On discharge he was comfortable on 
pressure support ventilation with 8 of PS, 8 of PEEP, FIO2 of 
0.4.  The patient's respiratory alkalosis was felt likely 
secondary to a central drive as he was without fever, pain, or 
hypoxia as alternative explanations.
.  

4. Anemia: This was felt secondary to intermittent phlebotomy, 
the bleeding from the chest tube and VATS in a patient with 
underlying low EPO state from his renal failure. He continued on 
epoetin with his HD sessions.  There was no evidence of iron 
deficiency. 
.  
5. CAD: No evidence of ACS per EKG or biomarkers. In evaluation 
of his hypotension as above, he was found to have a new anterior 
septal wall motion abnormality. The change in his LV function 
could be related to a peri-VATS MI although this could not be 
confirmed.  Given his lack of chest pain and his overall 
co-morbidities, proceeding to cardiac cath was deferred.  His LV 
apex was found to be akinetic but without thrombus.  He will be 
anticoagulated for this indication as well.  Beta-blockers and 
ACEi were discontinued secondary to the hypotension.  As he 
recovers from his acute illness and his midodrine can be weaned, 
an ACE inhibitor can be restarted.

.  
6. Rhythm:  
a) Afib. Was on Heparin gtt for anticoagulation which was held 
b/o Hct drop after VATS procedure and significant serosanquinous 
fluid drainage from chest tube. He remained pacer dependent at 
~70 bpm.  He will be discharged on a heparin drip which will be 
used to bridge him to therapeutic INR with coumadin.
.
b) H/o VT. Continued Amiodarone as above.
c) CHB, s/p PPM. V-paced rhythm.  
.  
7. Head CT finding: On presentation a head CT was notable for a 
potential subacute infarct.  There was no clear evidence of 
neurologic compromise.  He will continue anti-coagulation as 
above. 
.  
8. ESRD:  
Patient is anuric, HD schedule was changed from M/W/F to T/Th/Sa 
schedule. Continued Nephrocaps. Renally dosed meds.  He should 
continue to receive his EPO with his HD. 
.  
9. DM II: glucoses under moderate control. He will continue 
regular insulin sliding scale.
.  
10. Hyperlipidemia:  Continued statin  
.  
11. FEN: tube feeds 
.
12. PPX: anti-coagulated, PPI
.
13. Code: FULL
.
14. Dispo: the patient was discharged to LTAC for vent weaning, 
INR titration, and rehab.

     WET READ: JRCi MON [**2838-5-31**] 8:29 PM
      Large right pleural effusion with high density regions within worrisome for
      malignant effusion.  There are areas of airspace opacity with air bronchograms
      which may represent atelectasis vs consolidation.  Pulmonary hypertension is
      suggested by enlargement of the main pulmonary artery.  Substantial coronary
      artery calcifications.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  End-stage renal disease, CHF, presents with large exudative
     pleural effusion, rule out malignancy.
     
     COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, [**2838-5-28**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT imaging of the chest without intravenous contrast
     was displayed in 5 and 1.25 mm axial collimation.  Coronal reformatted images
     were also obtained.
     
     CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST:  Bilateral airspace consolidation--a large area in
     the right upper lobe and smaller in the left lower lobe--are either pneumonia
     or atelectasis.  A complex, large, layering right pleural effusion is encased
     by a high-density rim and contains multiple large hyperdense masses which
     could be hematomas or neoplasm. A tiny focus of pleural gas reflects
     thoracentesis. Bilateral pleural plaques are chronic. Fat stranding and edema
     is present in the subcutaneous tissues of the right chest wall.
     
     The bronchus intermedius and right middle and lower bronchi are occluded and
     there is the suggestion of a right hilar mass which would require contrast-
     enhanced CT or MRI for assessment.
     
     There is multichamber cardiomegaly with dense coronary artery calcifications,
     moderate aortic valvular and mitral annular calcifications.  Dual-chamber
     pacemaker leads course through the anticipated paths.  A right jugular central
     venous line tip terminates in the right atrium.  Ascites is small, and the
     left kidney is mildly atrophied.  Small retroperitoneal lymph and mesenteric
     lymph nodes do not meet size criteria for pathologic enlargement. Dense
     atherosclerotic disease includes the aorta and celiac branches.  There are no
     bone lesions suspicious for malignancy.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Multiple dense masses within complex large right effusion are atypical in
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     appearance for pleural tumor, more likely hematoma, but malignancy is still
     the top diagnostic consideration. A change in position with prone imaging
     would favor hematoma. If not, transthoracic needle aspiration is indicated,
     and should be feasible, for presumed mass.
     
     2.  Right middle and lower bronchial occlusion with possible occlusive mass.
     Evaluation with contrast by CT (or MR if patient cannot tolerate
     iodinated contrast) would be helpful.
     
     3.  Bilateral airspace consolidation, pneumonia or atelectasis.
     
     4.  Small volume of ascites.

     lung is clear.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  ET tube in the appropriate position.
     
     2.  Interval increase in size of pleural effusion/masses when compared to most
     recent radiographs of [**5-28**], probably unchanged in extent when compared to
     the scout view on recent chest CT.  Large pleural masses, better described on
     recent CT.

     INDICATION OF EXAM:  This is a 77-year-old man with end-stage disease, who
     needs central venous access for pressors.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 388**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 42**], the
     attending radiologist who was present and supervising throughout the
     procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  After informed consent was obtained from the patient
     explaining the risks and benefits of the procedure, the patient was placed
     supine on the angiographic table and the left neck was prepped and draped in
     standard sterile fashion.  After injection of 5 cc of 1% lidocaine, and using
     a 21-gauge needle, access was gained into the left internal jugular vein under
     ultrasonographic guidance.  Hard copies of the images before and after the
     venipuncture were obtained.  A 0.018 guide wire was then placed through the
     needle up to the level of the distal part of the SVC under fluoroscopic
     guidance.  The needle was then exchanged for 4.5 French micropuncture sheath.
     The wire was exchanged for a 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name **] wire.  The neck incision was then
     progressively dilated with 12 and 14 French dilators and a triple-lumen
     central line was placed over the wire with tip in the distal part of the SVC.
     The wire was removed and the lumens were flushed and heplocked.  The line was
     secured to the skin with 0 silk sutures and a standard transparent dressing
     was applied.  A final fluoroscopic image of the chest demonstrates the tip of
     the catheter to be located in the distal part of the SVC.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a triple-lumen central line via the left
     internal jugular vein with tip in the distal part of the SVC.  The line is
     ready for use.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION OF EXAM:  This is a 77-year-old man with end-stage disease, who
     needs central venous access for pressors.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 388**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 42**], the
     attending radiologist who was present and supervising throughout the
     procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  After informed consent was obtained from the patient
     explaining the risks and benefits of the procedure, the patient was placed
     supine on the angiographic table and the left neck was prepped and draped in
     standard sterile fashion.  After injection of 5 cc of 1% lidocaine, and using
     a 21-gauge needle, access was gained into the left internal jugular vein under
     ultrasonographic guidance.  Hard copies of the images before and after the
     venipuncture were obtained.  A 0.018 guide wire was then placed through the
     needle up to the level of the distal part of the SVC under fluoroscopic
     guidance.  The needle was then exchanged for 4.5 French micropuncture sheath.
     The wire was exchanged for a 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name **] wire.  The neck incision was then
     progressively dilated with 12 and 14 French dilators and a triple-lumen
     central line was placed over the wire with tip in the distal part of the SVC.
     The wire was removed and the lumens were flushed and heplocked.  The line was
     secured to the skin with 0 silk sutures and a standard transparent dressing
     was applied.  A final fluoroscopic image of the chest demonstrates the tip of
     the catheter to be located in the distal part of the SVC.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a triple-lumen central line via the left
     internal jugular vein with tip in the distal part of the SVC.  The line is
     ready for use.

     CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST OF [**2838-6-4**].
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2838-5-31**] chest CT.
     
     INDICATION:  Enlarged exudative pleural effusion.  Pleural-based mass on prior
     chest CT.
     
     Multidetector CT of the chest was performed following intravenous
     administration of 80 cc of Optiray.  Images are presented for display in the
     axial plane at 5 mm and 1.25 mm collimation.
     
     Large complex right pleural effusion is again demonstrated with elliptical
     configuration of loculated fluid surrounded by enhancing pleura (split pleura
     sign).  Within the lower right hemithorax, the majority of the pleural
     collection appears high attenuation measuring up to 70 Hounsfield units, with
     a similar attenuation although lower in Hounsfield units, compared to the
     spleen.  Similar Hounsfield unit values were obtained on the unenhanced CT of
     four days earlier, but the amount of high attenuation within the pleural
     collection has increased.  Within the nondependent portion of the loculated
     collection, Hounsfield units are approximately 23, slightly greater than those
     expected for simple fluid.  By comparison, small dependent left pleural
     effusion has Hounsfield units closer to 10 Hounsfield units.  Numerous
     mediastinal lymph nodes are present, most measuring under a centimeter but
     overall increased in number.  A lower right paratracheal node is enlarged
     measuring 1.3 cm in short axis dimension.  Right hilar and subcarinal nodes
     are also noted, which are mildly enlarged.  Heart is mildly enlarged.  No
     pericardial effusion is seen.
     
     In the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, mild ascites is present, and note
     is also made of diffuse anasarca.  Adrenal glands are incompletely imaged on
     this study were completely imaged on the prior CT.
     
     There has been interval intubation, with apparent overdistention of the
     endotracheal tube cuff.  Lung volumes are low related to imaging during the
     expiratory phase of respiration.  Right lung is partially atelectatic
     predominantly the middle and lower lobes adjacent to the loculated fluid
     collection.  Dependent atelectasis is also present in the left lower lobe.
     Right upper lobe confluent opacity is slightly improved, and note is made of
                                                                 (Over)

     thickened septal lines in the apex, probably reflecting mild interstitial
     edema.
     
     Skeletal structures demonstrate prior sternotomy.  Degenerative changes are
     present within the spine.
     
     Finally, bilateral calcified pleural plaques are noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Increasing high attenuation component of loculated right pleural effusion,
     consistent with a hemorrhagic effusion.  It is difficult to exclude an
     underlying pleural malignancy.
     
     2.  Right lung remains markedly atelectatic but lower lobe and middle lobe
     bronchi show improved patency compared to prior CT scan.  Peribronchiolar
     right hilar nodal disease is present, but no definite obstructing mass is
     identified. Once the right pleural effusion has been evacuated, repeat CT
     imaging may be helpful to assess for complete expansion of the right lung and
     to exclude underlying mass.
     
     3.  Small left pleural effusion with adjacent basilar atelectasis.
     
     4.  Persistent small amount of ascites and diffuse anasarca.
     
     5.  Improving aeration within the right upper lobe, which may be due to
     ismproving pneumonia and/or atelectasis.
     
     6.  Overdistention of endotracheal tube cuff.
     
     7.  Malalignment of sternal wires, a chronic finding dating back to [**2831-5-10**]
     without frank sternal dehiscence.

     SEMIERECT PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
     
     FINDINGS:  There has been no significant change in size of right-sided pleural
     effusion, and pleural masses better delineated on recent CT.  Right mid-to-
     lower hemithorax opacity reflective of atelectasis versus pneumonia is also
     stable in appearance.  There has been interval improvement of left basilar
     atelectasis with better visualization of the left hemidiaphragm. Endotracheal
     tube, pacemaker device, and central lines remain unchanged in position and
     there has been interval placement of a left-sided internal jugular central
     venous line with its distal tip within the mid SVC.  There is no evidence of
     pneumothorax.  Cardiac enlargement with a biatrial enlargement remains
     unchanged and coarse calcifications within the splenic vessels are noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No significant change in right-sided pleural effusion, pleural masses, and
     right mid-to-lower hemithorax opacity.
     
     2.  Decreased left basilar atelectasis.
     
     3.  Interval placement of a left-sided central venous line with no evidence of
     pneumothorax.

     HISTORY:  77-year-old man with possible lung malignancy status post
     respiratory arrest requiring intubation.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is hypodensity and loss of [**Doctor Last Name 30**]-white differentiation
     involving both occipital lobes as well as the left posterior parietal lobe.
     An old lacune is identified in the left basal ganglia.  There are also focal
     areas of hypodensity in the periventricular white matter, more prominent on
     the left. There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, or
     shift of normally midline structures.  Surrounding osseous and soft tissue
     structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Diffuse hypodensity and loss of [**Doctor Last Name 30**]-white differentiation in the
     occipital lobes and left posterior parietal lobe suggestive of a subacute
     infarction involving the posterior cerebral arteries bilaterally. On non
     contrast CT, no abnormal density is noted in the basilar artery, but this does
     not exclude thrombosis at the basilar bifurcation. MRI/MRA may be helpful for
     further evaluation. MRI would also be more sensitive for the detection of
     metastatic lesions.  No evidence of hemorrhage.

     INDICATION:  Evaluate endotracheal tube placement.
     
     Endotracheal tube tip terminates about 5 cm above the carina with slight over-
     distention of the tube cuff.  Vascular catheter and permanent pacemaker are
     unchanged in position.  There has been slight improved aeration within the
     right upper lung, but there is persistent diffuse opacification in the right
     mid and lower lung, which appears to be due to a combination of a moderate-to-
     large right effusion and adjacent atelectasis and/or pneumonia. Motion
     artifact results in blurring of the left vascular structures and diaphragm,
     limiting assessment of this region.

     CT CHEST [**6-7**]:
     
     HISTORY:  Large lymphocytic exudate of right pleural effusion.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector helical scanning of the chest was coordinated with
     intravenous infusion of 90 cc Optiray non-ionic iodinated contrast [**Doctor Last Name 74**]
     reconstructed as contiguous 5 and 1.25 mm thick axial and 5 mm thick coronal
     images compared to chest CTs on [**5-31**] and 27, 2007:
     
     FINDINGS:  The technical quality of today's study is severely compromised by
     patient positioning with the arms down and by patient motion.
     
     There has been a slight increase in the volume of the moderate to large right
     pleural effusion demonstrated by shift of the mediastinum back toward the
     midline.  The radiodensity of the material in the right pleural space is
     altered by severe artifact, but there is no reason to doubt the interpretation
     of the [**6-4**] study which diagnosed an increase in hematoma, large enough to
      obscure any pleural nodules that might be present. A much smaller, layering
     left pleural effusion has increased in volume and possibly in radiodensity.
     There is no pericardial effusion. Mediastinal lymph nodes are stable ranging
     up to 12 mm in size in the right lower paratracheal station, unchanged from
     prior studies.
     
     Severe consolidation persists in the right lung, predominantly in the lower
     lobe, probably relaxation atelectasis; a much smaller volume of atelectasis at
     the left lung base posteriorly has increased mildly.  The bronchial tree is
     currently patent, unchanged from [**6-4**], substantially cleared of secretions
     since [**5-31**]. There are no longer any radiographic findings to suggest a
     right hilar mass.  There is considerable volume of retained secretions in the
     lower trachea.
     
     Moderate global cardiomegaly is unchanged, heavy calcification in the aortic
     valve suggest stenosis, and mitral annular calcification could be contributing
     to mitral regurgitation.  A transvenous pacemaker lead ends in the apex of the
     right ventricle.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1)  Large hemorrhagic right pleural effusion increased slightly in
     volume since [**6-4**].  Any small pleural nodules might well be obscured, but
                                                                 (Over)

     no target for transthoracic needle aspiration is demonstrated either in the
     pleural space or in the largely atelectatic right lower lobe.  Smaller left
     pleural effusion and basal atelectasis have both increased slightly. 2) Global
     cardiomegaly.  Calcific aortic stenosis.  Possible mitral regurgitation. Heavy
     atherosclerotic calcification of native coronary arteries.  Status post CABG.

     arterial hypertension.  The patient has had median sternotomy.  Dual channels
     of the right central venous catheter end in the SVC and at the superior
     cavoatrial junction.  Left supraclavicular central line ends at the origin of
     the SVC.  Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are
     continuous from the left axillary pacer pack.  Lungs show mild vascular
     engorgement but no edema.  There is no left pleural effusion.  Misalignment of
     the fourth sternal wire has been present without change since [**2831-5-13**]. 
     No pneumothorax.

     Portable chest radiograph was compared to seven hours prior and demonstrates
     no significant interval change with ETT at the level of the clavicles,
     probable tracheal secretions, NG tube in stomach, large-bore right subclavian
     line terminating at the cavoatrial junction, and dual-chamber pacemaker. Right
     basilar chest tube is unchanged.  There is a moderate complex right pleural
     effusion with associated opacity, left lower lobe atelectasis/collapse, and
     cardiomegaly.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change allowing for differences in
     technique.

     HISTORY:  77-year-old with end-stage renal disease, right pleural effusion,
     status post right VATS with chest tube to suction.  Evaluate for change.
     
     FINDINGS:  Supine portable AP, comparison [**2838-6-8**], demonstrates interval
     increase in the airspace opacity which silhouettes the right heart border and
     the diaphragm.  The retrocardiac opacity has also increased since prior study.
     Endotracheal tube is 4.7 cm above carina.  The hemodialysis catheter, left
     subclavian venous catheter, right chest tube, pacemaker leads and sternal
     wires appear to be unchanged.  A new feeding tube terminates off of the scope
     of study but below left hemidiaphragm.  A small, partially loculated right
     pleural effusion is unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Worsening right lower, right middle, and possible left lower lobe
     pneumonias.

Nursing Progress Note: 1900-2300

Events: Pt. required re-intubation, restart of Dopamine gtt, and initiation of Fentanyl and Versed.

Neuro: Pt. initially alert, mouthing words but hard to interpret, moving all extremities, following commands, and interacting with family. Pt. became tired with increased work of breathing and then became lethargic prior to re-intubation.

CV: HR 70s V-paced with occ. PVCs, ABP 90s-130s/40s-50s. Dopamine turned off at 1900 with BP maintained. BP started to drop into 80s and then 70s systolic prior to re-intubation requiring restarting of Dopamine gtt@5mcg/kg/min with ABP now in 120s/60s. L SC TLC is patent and WNL, dressing changed. R radial arterial line is positional but works well for blood draws.

Resp: Pt. initially on 50% face tent but 02 sats started dropping so 02 eventually needed to be raised to 100% to maintain 02 sats in low 90s and then fell into 80s. Pt. also became fatigued with increased work of breathing. Team notified, resp and anesthesia called for re-intubation. Pt.placed on vent settings AC 500X14/100%/5, ABG 7.38/42/306. Fi02 dropped to 60% with goal to wean pt. to 40% overnight if possible. Lungs are course to all lobes with diminished RLL. Pt. has chest tube to H20 seal which has put out minimal serosanguinous fluid since [**2731**]. Pt. suctioned for bloody secretions.

GI: BSX4, two soft stool on shift. Tube feeds on hold since 1700.

GU: Pt. dialyzed with 4 litres taken off. Pt. received 2u PRBCs during dialysis.

Endo: BG coverd by sliding scale.

Skin: Coccyx is broken down with redness around perianal area. Dressing changed with wound gel applied. Ecchymotic areas to  abdomen.

Social: Family in to see pt.while extubated, called later and told of re-intubation.

     HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease status post right VATS.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**6-10**] through 4:
     
     Combination of atelectasis and pleural thickening and retained pleural fluid
     obscuring the right lung base is essentially stable since [**6-10**].  Respiratory
     motion obscures some of the detail in the lungs but there is probably no
     change in the left lower lobe consolidation due to pneumonia or atelectasis. 
     Upper lungs are relatively clear.  Severe cardiac enlargement is stable.  Tip
     of the ET tube at the upper margin of the clavicles is at least 6 cm from the
     carina and should be advanced 3 cm for optimal placement given the elevation
     of the chin.  Tip of the left supraclavicular line projects over the junction
     of brachiocephalic veins, a right supraclavicular dialysis catheter ends at
     the superior cavoatrial junction and in the lower SVC.  Nasogastric tube ends
     in the upper stomach.  Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer
     leads are unchanged in their respective positions.  No pneumothorax.

Renal:  decision made to start CVVHD d/t fluid overload (due for dialysis today) in the setting of hypotension/dopamine dependence.  CVVHD begun @ 1500, receiving replacement fluid @ 1500 cc/hour, Dialysate @ 500cc/hour, with goal of (-) 300 cc/hour.  PFR ^ each hour in attempt to reach goal of -300cc/hour without compromising BP--currently attaining goal of -200cc/hour without hypotension.  Calcium and KCl replacement gtts running according to protocol.  Heparin @ 350 units/hour, via CVVH machine as per protocol. (team aware and ok with restarting of heparin). Labs due @ 1800 and midnight.  T decreased from 96.9 to 94.7 with dialysis--^ blankets--will recheck and place pt. on bare hugger if persistantly low.

CV:  remains in V-paced rhythm (? underlying rhythm CHB), occassional intrinsic beat.  Dopamine @ 2 mcg/kg/min--attempted to wean earlier today, but BP labile (esp when repositioned).  No attempts to wean dopamine during initiation of CVVHD.  A-line with slight leak @ insertion site.  To have [**Last Name (un) **] stim test done this evening--will obtain baseline with 1800 [**Last Name (LF) 860**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need cosyntropin dose given with cortisol level one hour later.  Will also need PTT drawn with cortisol level.

Resp:  pt placed on CPAP (15 PS/ 5PEEP) @ 1230, breathing @ a rate of 36-40, TV ~ 300 cc's, MV [**11-18**].  ABG followed frequently--maintaining good oxygentation, without ^CO2.  Had a brief epsiode of apnea, with vent kicking into apnea mode.  Resolved within 1 minute--pt began breathing at rate of high 30's.  ABG obtained at the onset of apnea:  7.37/40/159/24/-1.  Lungs clear except for greatly diminished breath sounds at R base.  Scant ETS secrtions.  Started on atrovent/albuterol MDI's. 

Neuro:  pt. less alert today, arouses when name is called,falls asleep easily, squeezes hand when asked, but not as vigorous.  MAE.  does make attempts to reach for ETT, therefore hands remain restrained.  Versed gtt decreased from 2 mg/hour down to 0.75 mg/hour.

GI:  TF ^ to 40 cc/hour (goal), residuals had been 0-10cc's but @ 1600 ^ to 80 cc's.  Therefore TF on hold. Free water boluses given.  Abdomen obese, +BS, incon of liq brown OB- stool.  

Skin:  dressing from R VATS site changed, no drainage from site.  Dressing over CT site changed X1 d/t large amount of serous drainage.  Allevyn dressing over coccyx changed--serous drainage.  site cleansed with wound cleanser, pat dry.  No sting barrier wipe to skin in peri-anal area.

S: pt orally intubated, sedated. Able to nod to simple questions.

O: please see careview for vitals and other objective data

Pt somewhat unstable overnight, required increased dose  dopamine
to keep MAP greater than 60. BP dropped initially when pt turned, Down to 79/40, dopamine increased and UFR on CVVHDF decreased as well,
sedation decreased. pt responded to measures but later dropped BP again, low 80's when turned and 90/44 x 2 hours. MD [**First Name (Titles) 231**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5695**] with fair effect. Dopamine now running at 5.5 UG /kg/min, and UFR was decreased to zero, overnight, and now increased up to 80 cc fluid removal per hour, and pt appears to be tolerating that. CVP overnight [**1-21**]. Other issues overnight, pt was overbreathing the ventilator and Co2 was increased somewhat and PH up to 7.48, Team decided to decrease rate, from 8 to 6, and PH back down to 7.43 Co2 40. Abg remains the same this AM, but o2 down slightly and pt did not pass RSBI this AM, rapid breathing immediately when placed on 5 and 0. Will discuss with team this AM. Pt also had a brief period of frequent pvc, every fourth beat pvc. this resolved on its own, team aware. Pt Also not tolerating tube feeding overnight. Checked residual at midnight, over 200 cc in stomach, undigested tube feeding. Four hours later, 200 cc of yellow/clearish fluid. Tube feedings remain off. Pt may need reglan to help peristalsis. Hypoactive BS, will discuss with team this morning.
CVVHDF continues overnight, no incidence of clotting although some clots in filter. As mentioned above BP somewhat low overnight so UF was decreased and now we are increasing UF this morning and pt appears to be tolerating. Current fluid removal goal is net even fluid balance.

A: Pt tol CVVHDF but may not tolerate any increased fluid off, dopamine increased overnight. decreased GI motility, tube feeding on hold. Pt failed RSBI, but ABG is good on CMV. Lytes WNL , P was low and replaced overnight. CVP 12-14.

P: continue monitor lytes, ph, while on CVVHDF, follow K and ca replacemnet protocols. Discuss fluid goals with team in light of BP 
droipping overnight. Continue monitoe CV and resp status, ? adding reglan to help with GUt motility.

Renal:  remains on CVVHD, 500cc/hour dialysate, 1500cc/hour replacement fluid.  Goal per team/Renal Fellow this am was to get pt 0.5-1 L negative for day.  Renal attending in to examine pt this afternoon--thought pt. was on the dry side and suggested that if pt's BP dropped, to decrease PFR to keep pt. even rather than going up on dopamine.  Info communicated to team.  Ca/K/Heparin adjusted according to protocol.

CV:  received pt. on dopamine @ 1.5 mcg/kg/min--slowly weaned down to 0.6 Mcg/kg/min.  SBP drifting down to high 70's with CVP 10-11 ( had been 15-16).  PFR reduced to 0, with SBP trending up to 80's.  Spoke with intern and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]:  pt to receive 250cc NS, Keep PFR @ zero for now and reassess CVP/BP.  Probably needs CVP closer to 15 than to 10. HR 70 V-paced.

Resp:  lungs clear with greatly diminished breath sounds R base.  ETS-->scant tan secretions.  Placed on CPAP:  25PS/5PEEP--MV increasing to 16-21L and pt. developing resp alkalosis (pH 7.6).  CPAP changed to 15PS/5PEEP, MV [**1-22**] with RR high 30's, pH 7.52.  Placed back on AC:  40%-400-X6, 5 PEEP, pH 7.44.

GI: TF off this am d/t high residuals, restarted @ 1200 (20cc/hour) with reglan dose given.  Residuals high again @ 1600, TF off.  Abdomen soft.  One loose OB (-) stool.  Oral mucous membranes dry--very little oral secretions.

Neuro:  pt. awakens easily.  Shaking head yes/no to quesions.  Squeezes with left hand and wiggles toes on command.  Moves right hand but not on command.  Had to restrain both hands today for attempting to reach for tube.  Very agitated around 12noon--removing johhnny, sheets, reaching for IV tubings.  Given tylenol--settled down and has remained calm since then. Spoke with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], to keep on tylenol ATC for pain. 

Skin:  buttocks excoriated.  Cleansed with wound cleanser, pat dry.  Barrier cream and miconazole powder applied, but powder caked up--changed to anti-fungal cream/barrier cream.  Miconazole powder applied to groin (pink on left side).  Old CT dressing changed--small amount dried blood.  Site looks like it's healing--tissue better approximated than over the weekend.  

Social: daughter and son called to inquire re: pt's condition.  Plan is for family meeting Friday afternoon with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

A:  Pt appears dry with episodes of hypotension, CVP 10-11, dry mucous membranes.  Impaired skin integrity d/t poor nutrition /immobility/decreased perfusion. Agitation related to pain. Continues to have ^ residuals despite reglan and moving bowels ok.

P:  NS bolus to get SBP/CVP up, adjust PFR to keep SBP >90.  Skin care as above.  Monitor ABG's, lung sounds. Tylenol ATC.  Check with nutrition re:  TF recommendations

     EXAMINATION:  AP chest.
     
     INDICATION:  Right pleural effusion.  Right VATS.
     
     A single AP view of the chest is obtained on [**2838-6-19**] at 0814 hours and
     compared with the prior radiograph performed approximately 24 hours
     previously.  Tubes and lines are unchanged.  The patient is developing linear
     atelectasis at the left base but the left lung is otherwise unchanged. 
     Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm together with subtle opacities in the
     right lower and mid lung fields likely represent atelectasis.  Mild increase
     in the opacity of the right hemithorax compared with the left may represent
     some fluid layering posteriorly.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Linear atelectasis developing at the left base.  Otherwise no significant

     middle and lower lobe atelectasis and/or consolidation.  Retrocardiac opacity
     also likely represents atelectasis.  Left IJ line terminates at the confluence
     of the brachiocephalic veins, right IJ tunneled catheter terminates at
     approximately the cavoatrial junction, and dual chamber pacemaker is in
     unchanged position.

 NEURO:  Alert, follows commands inconsistently. PERRL, 3mm. Right arm weakness, right BKA.  Angry/slight agitation in am, trying to communicate what is uncomfortable but unable to interpret- did mouth words ""I want to eat"" and  ""[**Doctor First Name **] are confusing me""  Explained hospital course to pt in simple terms and reasons for unable to eat normally. Several comfort maneuvers attemtped today to ease agitation, pt finally comfortable and breathing effectively on CPAP w/ PS after TF suspended for abd pain, flexi-seal removed for thick stool and dilaudid IV given- MICU team aware of acute discomfort today and TF residual of 150ml. 

RESP: Unable to trial trach mask today secondary to tachypnea and increased WOB, low tidal volumes on CPAP w/ PS needing titration and recruitment. Pt not always agitated when tachypnic, RR increased progressively and pt appeared ""tired"" CXR taken for poor bs on right.  Was OOB to chair for 2 hrs, returned to bed to r/o new activity as variable for tachypnea- continued RR 40 when in bed though SPO2 98% and ABGs wnl. Due to agonal appearing WOB, pt returned to CMV ventilation, repositioned, Dilaudid IV, removed flexi-seal as well as suspending TF. Within an hour pt appeared significantly more comfortable and returned to CPAP w/ PS 8 PEEP 10. ABG wnl. 

HEMODYNAMICS: V-paced rhythm 100% at 70. Arterial SBP range 98-140s, MAP > 60 off pressors. Midodrine dose decreased to 5m TID by MICU team. HD pt, no u.o. Edematous upper body, abdomen distended/large. 
Heparin gtt goal PTT 60-80, titrated up at 1730 for PTT 49.1. No sx bleeding. 

GI/METABOLIC: NPO. TF at goal 55ml/hr, residuals became high (150ml) in afternoon correlating with acute abdominal discomfort, belly large, + bs. TF held, flexi-seal removed for formed stool ?unable to pass. Appeared more comfortable immediately after these measures. Phosphate low 1.1, repleted with neutra-phos. Ion Ca 1.08 repleted. Glucoses acceptable, on RISS. 

PSYSCHOSOCIAL: Pts daughter at bedside, supportive to father. Distressed by his discomfor and slow vent wean- she understands ""big picture"" and understands recognizing ""good days and bad days"" to evaluate which is outweighing the other- Currently, she hopes he will recover as he has in the past. 

PLAN OF CARE: Continue to wean vent while maintaining pts comfort- ?trial trach mask tonight.  Pulmonary hygiene. neuro assessments as indicated. Heparin gtt, draw PTT due 2330. Phos/calcium repletions, f/u labs 2000. Aggressive skin care, OOB to chair daily. Emotional support to pt and family, education re: palliative options appropriate. D/C to Rehab tomorrow if no compliations o/n- screening complete.
