Intubation.
Cardiac Catherization with stent placement.
Swan-Ganz hemodynamic monitoring through the right internal

History of Present Illness:
   This is an 87 year-old male with history of 3 vessel coronary 
disease, congestive heart failure, aortic stenosis, diabetes, 
end-stage renal disease not on dialysis who presents with ST 
elevation infarction.  He was recently admitted with unstable 
angina and was discharged 2 days prior to this presentation.  He 
had been having intermittent chest pain with exertion that 
resolved with rest for the past month.  The morning of 
admission, he had [**7-29**] burning substernal chest pain with 
intermittent radiation to the left chest.  He came into the 
emergency department and was found to have ST elecations 
inferiorly.  It was felt that he had collateral insufficiency 
given inferior ST elevations in the setting of a known occluded 
right coronary.  Given prior plans for medical management, he 
received aspirin, sublinqual nitro x 3, Plavix 600 mg, heparin 
srip, lopressor, morphine and ativan.  His chest pain resolved 
in the emergency department, and he was transferedd to the CCU.  
Upon arrival to the CCU, he complained of persistent burning 
substernal chest pain, and he EKG had persistent ST elevations 
inferiorly with ST elevations in V4 with right-sided leads.  He 
became acutely hypoxic to the 80s on a non-rebreather.  A 
bedside echocardiogram showed severely depressed left 
ventricular function with preserved right ventricular function.  
After discussions with his outpatient nephrologist, covering 
cardiologist, and daughters, he was taken emergently to the 
catherization lab for a diagnostic and potentially therapeutic 
catherization despite the risk of needing dialysis after the dye 
load.  He was emergently intubated.  He was started on pressors 
for cardiogenic shock.  Catherization revealed severe stenosis 
at the left main trifucation.  A stent was placed to the 
proximal LAD.  He was transfered to the CCU for further 
management.
 
Past Medical History:
1. Coronary artery disease status post an MI [**86**] years ago.  A 
catherization in [**3254**] showed severe 3 vessel disease.  A 
decision was made then not to pursue bypass surgery.  
Persantine-MIBI on [**4-3**] showed fixed inferior and inferiolateral 
perfusion defect.
2. Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 19% on 
persantine-MIBI [**3263-4-3**].
3. Aortic Stenosis with a gradient of 41 mmHg in 6/05.
4. Diabetes that is diet controlled.
5. End stage renal disease not on dialysis.
6. Hypertension.
7. Hyperlipidemia.
8. Hypothyroidism.
9. Hiatal hernia with gastroesophageal reflux.
10. Status post ressection of the sigmoid colon and rectum for 
colon cancer.
11. Prostate cancer with watchful waiting.
 
Social History:
He is widowed and lives alone.  He is independent at baseline.  
He is a former smoker and he occasionally drinks alcohol.
 
Family History:
Non-contributory.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 87 year-old gentleman with known 3 vessel coronary 
artery disease, congestive heart failure EF 25%, aortic stenosis 
([**Location (un) **] 0.9 cm2), diabetes who presented with an inferior 
ST-elevation myocardial infarction secondary to collateral 
insufficiency.  He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 83**] with 
complaints of chest pain and found to have significant CAD based 
on a Persantine MIBI test, however a cardiac catheterization 
could not be performed given the severe acute on chronic renal 
failure.  This particular hospitalizations was complicated by 
multiple factors including cardiogenic shock, septic shock, 
repeated episodes of aspiration PNA, and flash pulmonary edema.  
After his last episode of hypoxic respiratory failure and 
intubation/extubation, the pt was made DNR/DNI after long 
discussions with the patient and his family.  Soon after he was 
medically stabilized and transferred to out of the CCU.  However 
he suffered another episode of respiratory distress during which 
time he was made CMO after discussion with the patient and the 
HCP.  The details of the hospital course are summarized below.
.
.
CODE STATUS: Prior to admission, the pt was living independently 
with intact ADL and IADLS.  However, this hospitalization for 
STEMI was complicated by episodes of shock and hypoxic 
respiratory distress requiring intubation/extubation after which 
point the patient was made DNR/DNI.  He was stabilized medically 
and called out of the ICU on [**3263-4-23**].  However he experienced 
another episode of respiratory distress from pulmonary edema on 
the evening of [**3263-4-25**].  The following day, a family meeting was 
held with the patient and both the patient and the HCP agreed to 
become CMO.  He was subsequently transitioned off medical 
therapy and instead started on a morphine drip through a 
pre-existing PICC line for comfort measures.  In addition, the 
pt was written for PRN nebulizers and promethazine.  If needed, 
the pt should also receive a Scopolamine patch.
.
.
1. STEMI: His inferior infarction was attributed to collateral 
insufficiency.  Initially, there was concern for right 
ventricular involvement.  However the right ventricle had 
preserved function on a bedside echocardiogram.  Catherization 
confirmed severe 3 vessel disease.  At the time of 
catherization, CT surgery felt that he was not a surgical 
candidate given his multiple comorbidities.  Therefore, he 
underwent stenting to the origin of the LAD.  His CKs peaked at 
1351 and trended down post-intervention.  He was maintained on 
aspirin, Plavix, and Lipitor.  When he was weaned from pressors, 
he was started on a beta-blocker.  This was discontinued upon 
commencement of amiodarone.  After catheterization, the patient 
did not have any complaint of chest pain, nor did he have 
concerning EKG changes.   
.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: His initial respiratory failure 
was likely secondary to cardiogenic shock in the setting of his 
ST elevation myocardial infarction.  He required intubation 
prior to his catherization.  Post-procedure, he developed 
copious amounts of dark thick sputum.  At that time, he 
developed a fever and a white count.  He was presumed to have an 
aspiration pneumonia as below.  He was maintained on the 
ventilator while he was on pressors for shock.  As his shock 
resolved, he became more hypertensive with elevated pulmonary 
artery pressures.  At that time, he had evidence of pulmonary 
edema.  He was diuresed prior to extubation.  He was 
successfully extubated on hospital day 7.  On hospital day 9, he 
had an episode of hypoxia in the setting of hypertension that 
was consistent with flash pulmonary edema.  A chest x-ray showed 
marked increased in bilateral pulmonary edema.  He received 
Lasix and metolazone.  His symptoms improved with diuresis.  On 
[**4-20**] he developed respiratory failure secondary to pulmonary 
edema and likely aspiration pneumonia, which was treated with 
triple antibiotics. His pulmonary edema responded poorly to 
attempted diuresis. Mental status waxed and waned but was 
generally declining and urine output poor in setting of 
aggressive diuresis. Patient and family did not want to pursue 
dialysis. Given poor prognosis decision was made with the family 
to move toward comfort care/hospice.
.
3. Shock: Initially, he had evidence of cardiogenic shock with a 
low cardiac index on dopamine.  A balloon pump was placed at the 
time of catheterization and he was continued on dopamine.  A 
Swan-Ganz catheter was placed for hemodynamic monitoring.  On 
hospital day 3, he had evidence of septic shock give and 
elevated cardiac index with a low systemic vascular resistance.  
He had developed a fever to 101.3 and a white count of 22.  He 
did not respond to a cortisol stimulation test and was started 
on stress dose steroids.  He was started empirically of 
vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl for a presumed aspiration 
pneumonia and completed a 10 day course.  All cultures remained 
negative.  Since his cardiac output had improved, the balloon 
pump was removed.  With the onset of the septic shock, he became 
more hypotensive.  Therefore, Levophed was started in addition 
to the dopamine.  Over the next few days, he became afebrile, 
his white count trended down, and he was weaned from all 
pressors.  The Swan-Ganz catheter was subsequently removed.  He 
has remained hemodynamically stable since that time.
.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: He intermittently went into atrial 
fibrillation.  On hospital day 9, he had atrial fibrillation 
with rapid ventricular rate with associated hypotension.  He was 
loaded with IV amiodarone.  Subsequently, he dropped his 
pressures and became bradycardic.  He was transitioned to oral 
amiodarone and received 2 days of 400 bid followed by 400 daily 
which at this point will be continued indefinitely. Amiodarone 
was discontinued prior to discharge when decision was made to 
transition to comfort care.
.
5. Congestive heart failure: A post-intervention echocardiogram 
showed an ejection fraction of 15%.  He initially had a balloon 
pump for support.  In the setting of septic shock, he became 
total body fluid overloaded and required diuresis with Lasix.  
With improvement in his perfusion pressures, he began to 
autodiuresis.  He did go into flash pulmonary edema on [**4-20**] 
which eventually resolved. He has been difficult to diurese 
despite multiple attempts with agressive high dose diuretics.  
He continues to be total volume overloaded. He will be 
discharged on furosemide 60 mg po qd and with morphine for 
symptomatic control of dyspnea.
.
6. End-stage renal disease: His renal function had been 
deteriorating prior to admission.  Discussions were held with 
his nephrologist prior to taking him to the catherization lab.  
It was felt that the benefit of angiography with possible 
intervention outweighed the risk of contrast nephropathy.  
Post-procedure, his creatinine trended down with adequate urine 
output.  On hospital day 3 with the onset of septic shock, his 
creatine began to rise.  This rise was likely from decreased 
renal perfusion.  As he was weaned off of the pressors and as 
his blood pressure improved, his urine output increased with a 
subsequent decrease in his creatinine.  Dialysis was discussed 
with patient and family but this was not consistent with his 
known wishes. 
.
7. Ileus: On admission, he had not had a bowel movement in 10 
days.  Plain films confirmed that his intestines were full of 
stool.  He received an aggressive bowel regimen.  After several 
days, a abdominal plain film showed dilated colonic loops.  An 
abdominal CT confirmed the dilated loops of bowel and showed no 
signs of obstruction.  Surgery was consulted and felt that this 
was consisted with ileus likely secondary to the fentanyl during 
sedation.  He was decompressed with an NG tube to low suction 
and rectal tube.  Repeat abdominal plain films showed no further 
dilatation.  Once he was off of fentanyl sedation, his bowel 
sounds improved and he began to move his bowels.  He was 
maintained on bisacodyl suppositories.
.
8. Aortic stenosis: He has severe aortic stenosis with a 
gradient of 64 mmHg and a valve area of 0.9. Volume status was 
carefully monitored given this setting.
.
9. Diabetes: His blood glucose was slightly elevated during the 
initial periods of septic shock.  At that time, he was 
maintained on an insulin sliding scale.  He was later well 
controlled and did not require any additional insulin.
.
10. Prophylaxis: He was maintained on subcutaneous heparin.  He 
was on a bowel regimen as above.  He was maintained on 
pantoprazole.
.
11. Access: He initially had a Swan-Ganz through his right 
femoral vein.  This was resited to the right internal jugular.  
The balloon pump was in the left femoral artery.  A radial 
arterial line was placed when the balloon pump was removed.  
Once he was stable off of pressors, the swan and the central 
line were removed.  He had peripheral IVs. He will be discharged 
with PICC line to facilitate morphine administration.
.
12. FEN: He was started on tube feeds on hospital day 3 as he 
was still intubated.  These were held in the setting of ileus.  
He was diuresed as above.  He was maintained on tube feeds.  As 
his mental status improved, he was evaluated for PO intake.  
Eventually he underwent video speech and swallow evaluation 
which revealed delayed laryngeal closure; it was recommended 
that he try ground solids and thickened liquids.  Soon after 
beginning this, he had likely aspiration event leading to PNA 
(see above).  After recovering from this, he was maintained on 
cautious PO diet.  Per family request, he was allowed to have 
thin liquids as well.  He continues to be at high risk for 
aspiration.
