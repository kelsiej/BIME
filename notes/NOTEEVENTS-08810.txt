CXR: 
UPRIGHT AP CHEST: The patient is post-median sternotomy. The 
heart is 
probably enlarged. The aorta is tortuous. There is a double 
contour in the region of the right atrium, which may reflect 
left atrial enlargement. No definite consolidation is present. 
No evidence of CHF. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax 
detected. The osseous structures are unremarkable.  IMPRESSION: 
No definite consolidation or CHF. 
LATERAL VIEW OF THE CHEST: The patient is post median 
sternotomy. There are no definite consolidations seen on the 
lateral view. No pleural effusions.  When viewed in conjunction 
with the prior AP radiograph, there is prominence of the right 
hilum. This may represent early congestion. There is no evidence 
of overt failure, however. Degenerative changes of the spine are 
noted. 
. 
EKG:  Sinus rhythm, inferior Q waves consistent with prior 
inferior infarction. Right bundle branch block (old).  T wave 
inversion V1-4. ? old. 
. 
STRESS TEST 2002:
EKG stress: exercised for 6 minutes of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1078**] protocol and 
asked the test be stopped for fatigue. No arm, neck, back or 
chest discomfort was reported by the patient throughout the 
study. The ST segments are uninterpretable for ischemia in the 
setting of the baseline inverted T waves. The rhythm was sinus 
with several isolated vpbs. Appropriate sytolic BP response to 
exercise. IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or interpretable 
EKG changes. Nuclear report sent separately.

MIBI images: Neither resting nor stress images reveal any 
myocardial wall perfusion abnormalities. Ejection fraction 
calculated from gated wall motion images obtained after exercise 
shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of approximately 67%. 
Regional wall motion appears grossly normal. IMPRESSION: No 
evidence of myocardial wall perfusion abnormalities at the level 
of exercise achieved.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
1. Dyspnea : Etiology initially unclear, but he reported chronic 
dyspnea that acutely worsened. He ruled out for MI by enzymes 
and EKG-- (trop leak but has ARF on CRI; CKs flat). Had a 
persantine mibi which showed normal EF and perfusion, no 
symptoms. A chest xray was w/o infiltrate or effusion. Echo was 
performed which showed EF 70% and essentially normal study w/o 
wall motion abnormalities or valvular regurgitaton/stenosis. 
Despite these normal studies, patient continued to have dyspnea 
at rest, often with resp rates in the 40's, but with normal 
oxgyen saturations. He was extremely anxious, agitated at times, 
often not allowing his housestaff examine him and speak with 
him. He was a very difficult historian. A chest CT was performed 
to further evaluate the lung parenchyma which showed bilateral 
peripheral ground glass opacities in the absence of pleural 
effusions or septal thickening. Given the elevated white blood 
cell count and clinical picture, a multifocal pneumonia was 
thought most likely. He was treated with ceftriaxone and 
azithromycin, but he refused these treatments for approximately 
24 hours. He was extremely anxious that we were trying to hurt 
him and that we didn't understand what was wrong with him. He 
would repeatedly say ""nothing is wrong with me."" After multiple 
conversations with the Russian interpreter and a psychiatry 
consultation, patient agreed to receive his antibiotics.  He 
clinically improved over the first few days, but then acutely 
decompensated with an episode hypotension and tachypnea 
overnight. He was transferred to the ICU. Heparin drip was 
started for fear of MI and/or PE and was aggressively hydrated 
with good BP response. He ruled out for MI and a V/Q scan was 
attempted but patient didn't tolerate/complete the study. A CTA 
was not possible, given his renal insufficiency. Antibtics were 
contined as well and he was transferred back to the floor after 
an approximately 48 hour ICU course. 

Upon arrival to the floor, patient continued to have episodes of 
tachypnea and was placed on a non-rebreather. He had normal 
oxygen saturations during that time. ABG 7.39/29/223 on NRB. He 
would not allow his resident physician to examine him, thus an 
emergent psychiatry consultation was obtained. He continued to 
refuse to be seen by his resident physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 5685**] multiple 
efforts. He believed his resident was the daughter of people who 
hated him and, in turn, he hated her. It was decided he would be 
transferred to another medical service. Despite this, the 
patient had symptomatic relief with some ativan and morphine, 
breathing slowed, and he appeared improved. It was thought this 
tachypnea was secondary to a multifocal pneumonia (rather than a 
PE), as well as severe agitation and hyperventilation. His 
heparin was stopped at this time and he continued to improve 
over the next few days until his acute decompensation on the 
evening of his death.  Autopsy revealed multiple pulmonary 
emboli.
.
4. Elevated blood glucose: Has diagnosis of DM per his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 508**] 
he is non compliant w/ DM strategies as outpatient per PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] 
on sliding scale here but refused teaching on DM care.
.
5. Hyperlipidemia: Had fasting lipid profile w/ severe 
dyslipidemia. Started lipitor on [**4-14**].
.
6. schizophrenia: documented in OMR. Not on meds. Has paranoid 
features and is hypersexual, inappapropriate at times. Started 
seroquel prn qhs. Haldol needed on [**4-13**] for agitation. 
Psychiatry consultation obtained multiple times as stated above 
for occasional refusal of care and splitting behaviors.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Seventy-seven year old male with dyspnea and atypical chest pain. 
      
     SUMMARY OF THE PRELIMINARY REPORT FROM THE EXERCISE LAB: 
     Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142 
     mg/kg/min. Two minutes after the cessation of infusion, Tc-99m sestamibi was
     administered IV.  
      
     INTERPRETATION: 
     Image Protocol: Gated SPECT. 
     Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium-201. 
     Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images. 
     This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model. 
      
     Left ventricular cavity is normal. 
     Rest and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake throughout the
     myocardium. 
      
     Gated images reveal normal wall motion. 
     The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 76%. 
      
     There are no changes as compared to exercise MIBI dated [**3267-10-14**].   
      
     IMPRESSION: 1. Normal myocardial perfusion. 2. Normal left ventricular cavity
     size and function.

     HISTORY:  Status post CABG, CAD or dyspnea.  Right hilar fullness on x-ray and
     white blood cell count of 20.  No fever.
     
     COMPARISON:  Plain radiograph of the chest from [**3270-4-13**].
     
     TECHNIQUE: Unenhanced chest CT.
     
     CORONAL REFORMATS:  The coronal reformats confirm the findings described
     below.
     
     CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a bilateral peripheral patchy
     distribution of  ground glass opacities involving the right lower lobe lingula
     and right upper lobe.  Some of these opacities are in a dependent location but
     the majority are nondependent.  There are no dominant nodules or masses.  The
     central airways are patent.  There is some respiratory motion artifact.  There
     is no effusion or pneumothorax.  The patient is status post median sternotomy.
     There is no lymph adenopathy. The hila are unremarkable, with no abnormal
     findings to correspond to the CXR finding of hilar fullness. There is coronary
     artery calcification.
     
     The imaged portions of the upper abdomen demonstrate somewhat dense-appearing
     bile perhaps representing sludge.  This also could represent excreted contrast
     material if the patient has had a contrast-enhanced exam such as a cardiac
     catheterization recently.  Additionally, the left kidney is atrophic and
     contains several hypodense lesions or varying size likely representing cysts.
     The right kidney is of a more normal size and also contains an exophytic
     simple cyst.  Bones reveal degenerative changes.
     
     IMPRESSION: Bilateral peripheral ground glass opacities in the absence of
     pleural effusions or septal thickening.  Given the elevated white blood cell
     count, a multifocal pneumonia is thought most likely.  Follow-up imaging after
     treatment may be useful.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     Chest, single AP film.
     
     HISTORY:   Pneumonia with worsening dyspnea and tachypnea.
     
     Status post CABG.  There there are low lung volumes.  Allowing for this, there
     is probable cardiomegaly but no definite CHF.  There is a focal peripheral
     opacity at the right base, unchanged since the prior study of [**3270-4-16**] and
     linear atelectasis in the left lower zones.  No definite new lung lesions,
     pleural effusions, or pneumothorax.  
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     No significant change in right basilar opacity.  Significant resolution of the
     previously noted left lower zone linear atelectases.  No new abnormalities.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      evaluate for consolidation / effusion                                           
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Dyspnea and tachypnea.  Multifocal pneumonia.  Sudden respiratory
     distress.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3270-4-18**].
     
     AP PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST:  There is persistent elevation of the left
     hemidiaphragm, and the patient is post median sternotomy and CABG.  The
     mediastinal contours are unchanged.  There is persistent opacity at the right
     lung base laterally, and there is increasing left basilar opacity and opacity
     in the peripheral left lung.  Small effusions are not excluded.  The
     vascularity does not appear engorged.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Slight worsening of the left lung opacities.  Persistent right
     basilar opacity. These findings may represent a multifocal pneumonia. Given
     the peripheral predominance, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia and cryptogenic
     organizing pneumonia should also be considered.
