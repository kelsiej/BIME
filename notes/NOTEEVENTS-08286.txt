                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:  58-year-old woman with breast cancer.
     
     COMPARISONS:  [**2876-11-16**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial non-contrast CT imaging of the abdomen was performed,
     followed by imaging of the chest and abdomen with oral and intravenous
     contrast.  Following a 3-minute delay, additional imaging of the abdomen and
     pelvis was also performed.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is persistent diffuse mediastinal
     lymphadenopathy, slightly more prominent than before.  For example, there is a
     confluent nodal mass in the upper right paratracheal region of 24 x 28 mm in
     axial dimensions (series 3, image 11), larger than previously identified
     cluster of nodes in the same area, which measured overall 19 x 19 mm before.
     Similarly, there is slightly greater prominence of a precarinal nodal mass of
     overall 41 x 29 mm in axial dimensions (series 3, image 18).
     
     There are multiple new left axillary lymph nodes, which are enlarged. A
     previously identified left axillary node of 17 x 14 mm now measures 18 x 12
     mm and is stable, but several strongly enhancing nodules more laterally are
     much more prominent than on the prior study.  The largest measures 12 x 8 mm.
     Although difficult to assess with CT, there may be a new left breast nodule of
     9 x 11 mm as well. A mass involving the subcutaneous left lateral tissues and
     adjacent shoulder muscles of about 3 cm in diameter is not significantly
     changed.  The patient is status post right mastectomy.  There is no right
     axillary lymphadenopathy.
     
     There is similar pleurodesis change with nodular pleural thickening in the
     left lung, and although some aerated lung is still present, there are similar
     multiple pleural loculations, with a similar appearance.
     
     Multiple new subcentimeter pulmonary nodules in the right lung are suspicious
     for metastases.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There are multiple vaguely
     defined hypoattenuating nodules in the liver, consistent with metastases,
     although these appear slightly less prominent perhaps than on the prior study.
     Several, within the right lobe in particular, measure 1-1.5 cm in diameter.
     These seem most susceptible to measurements on the precontrast imaging.  The
     largest measures 15 x 19 mm, and is located within the junction of segments
     VII and VIII. This particular lesion is little changed.
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     
     The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys are within
     normal limits.  The stomach, small and large bowel, appear normal.  There is
     no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, or free air or fluid.
     Numerous small retroperitoneal lymph nodes, not enlarged by CT criteria, are
     unchanged.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The uterus, rectum, sigmoid, distal
     ureters, and bladder are unremarkable.  There is no pelvic or inguinal
     lymphadenopathy, or free air or fluid.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There is interval progression of bony metastases including
     several relatively subtle sclerotic foci within the axial skeleton. Previously
     noted sclerotic lesion in T1 is not significantly changed, but there is a new
     lytic bony lesion within L1.  Vertebral body heights are preserved, however.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Progression of metastatic disease, including new enlarged left axillary
     lymph nodes, [**Hospital1 6595**] slightly increased mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.
     
     2.  New multiple small pulmonary nodules in the right lung, suspicious for
     metastases.
     
     3.  Fairly stable appearance of hepatic metastases, perhaps minimally improved
     since the prior study.
     
     4.  Progression of osseous metastases, including a new lytic lesion in L1.

     RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA:
        26.8 mCi Tc-99m MDP;
     HISTORY: 58 year old woman with metastatic breast cancer. Left lower back/waist
     pain. 
      
     INTERPRETATION:   
      
     Whole body images of the skeleton were obtained in anterior and posterior  
     projections. As seen in the previous study of [**2875-5-3**], there is still some
     focally increased uptake at the T1. The previously described increased tracer
     activity at the T8 right costovertebral junction is also again noted but less
     prominent. 
      
     There is new increased uptake along the lengths of the right 6th and left 7th
     and 8th ribs posteriorly.  Relative [**Name (NI) 6592**] in a geographic area of the right
     anterior chest wall may relate to attenuation or prior radiation. 
      
     The kidneys and urinary bladder are visualized, the normal route of tracer
     excretion. 
      
     IMPRESSION: New increased uptake at the right 6th and left 7th and 8th ribs
     suggesting progression of metastatic disease.

     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images of the chest were obtained with IV contrast.
     
     CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The patient is status post right mastectomy.  The
     heart and great vessels are unremarkable with no evidence of gross saddle
     pulmonary embolus. Again seen are multiple left axillary as well as
     mediastinal lymph nodes.  A large pretracheal lymph node measures 2.3 x 2.1 cm
     and previously measured 2.8 x 2.4 cm.  A precarinal nodal mass measures 3.9 x
     2.7 cm and previously measured 4.1 x 2.9 cm. There is intubation of the right
     main stem bronchus. There is collapse of the left main stem bronchus
     associated post- obstructive atelectasis.
     
     The patient is status post pleurodesis and loculated effusions are unchanged
     compared to the prior examination.  There are ill- defined ground-glass
     opacities in the right lung as well as multiple nodules worrisome for
     metastases.  A left mass involving the subcutaneous lateral tissues is not
     significantly changed in size.  The osseous structures again demonstrate a

mastectomy and multiple chemotherapeutic regimens and hormone 
therapy now on taxotere (17 cycles) salvage therapy who was in 
USOH until 9 pm [**2878-4-18**]. She noted acute onset of hemoptysis 
with shortness of breath. Per family pt was aggitated and taken 
to ED. In ED hemodynamically stable but O2 sat 88% RA. Per 
report, she had about 6 tablespoons of bright red hemoptysis. 
CXR showed left sided white out and she was intubated in right 
mainstem. OGT lavage noted 150 cc of dark blood.  
Incidently, she had torso CT on [**4-11**] showing new subcentimeter 
right sided pulm nodules and increase in hilar lymphadenopathy. 
Per family report has not had bleeding, hemoptysis, 
fevers/chills, lower ext swelling/trauma, or recent shortness of 
breath. Has been taking NSAIDS on prn basis.  
.
She was admitted to the MICU, with right mainstem intubation. A 
CT was performed demonstrating diffuse metastatic disease. She a 
flexible bronchoscopy in the OR performed on [**4-19**] which showed 
ischemic changes of R mainstem ([**1-6**] ETT cuff) and no obvious 
source of bleeding. The left bronchial tree was narrowed 
distally with billious secretions noted. She was extubated in OR 
prior to returning to the MICU. In the MICU she also had an EGD 
demonstrating an ulcer in the body of the stomach without 
evidence of active bleeding or adherent clot. As her Hct and O2 
sats were stable for 12 hours, she was [**Hospital 11483**] [**Hospital 11484**] medical

Brief Hospital Course:
#) Hematemesis vs hemoptysis - The patient was admitted for 
hemoptysis vs hematemesis. She was intubated in the ED initially 
in the right mainstem bronchus, as there was concern for her 
left lung to bleed into her right lung. Flexible bronch was 
performed which showed ischemia of the area with the cuff on the 
right, and bilious fluid but no bleeding on the left. She was 
put on antibiotics empirically to prevent pneumonia/pneumonitis. 
She was extubated uneventfully. pt continued to have stable, 
low-volume hemoptysis during the remainder of the admission. The 
source was thought most likely to be pulmondary, given diffuse 
metastatic disease seen on CT, although bronch was without 
definite endobronchial lesion. ENT was consulted, and scope did 
not show ENT source of bleeding. Pt required 1 U PRBC's during 
this admission to maintain hct>30. NSAIDS were d/c'd, and this 
was listed as an allergy on pt's med list given non-bleeding 
ulcer seen on EGD. Pt was continued on high-dose PPI during the 
admission and on discharge.  Pt only had one episode of 
desaturation during the admission to the high 80's on room air.  
She was given O2 for comfort, and was set up for home O2 on 
discharge.  If pt developed more significant hemoptysis, she may 
need embolectomy by interventional radiology in the future.
.
#) Gastric ulcer - GI was consulted given the concern for coffee 
grounds by lavage, and EGD revealed an ulcer in the stomach 
body, nonbleeding. H pylori was sent and she should follow up 
with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and continue PPI twice daily for the next several 
weeks. She will need a repeat endoscopy in 2 months.
.
#) Breast CA - The patient has stage IV metaststic breast 
cancer. She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8588**] as an outpatient.
.
#) Low-grade Fever - Pt had low-grade temps during the 
admission. Thought to be due to infection vs. tumor vs. 
post-bronch. Pt also had leukocytosis, which was chronic.  
- Pt was placed on ceftriaxone and azithromycin on admission to 
prevent infection, given significant blood/effusion was seen on 
chest CT.  CTX was then d/c'd, and azithromycin was continued 
for 10 day course. Blood and urine cultures were negative.
.
#) R forearm swelling: Pt had episode of mild R forearm 
swelling, possibly due to A-line while pt was in ICU.  
- did not pursue u/s, given result would not change mangement 
(not a candidate for anticoagulation in setting of hemoptysis)  
.  
#) HTN - held anti-hypertensive meds in setting of bleeding, 
also held on discharge  
.
#) FEN - NPO initially, then advanced to regular diet prior to 
d/c.
.  
#) Proph: PPI bid, pneumoboots, down on left side in case of 
hemoptysis, suction at bedside  
.
#) Code - pt remained FULL CODE during the admission

                                     FINAL REPORT
     REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Recurrent hemoptysis in a patient with metastatic
     breast cancer to lung, bone and liver.
     
     Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to the previous film from [**2878-4-19**], made at 00:42 a.m.
     
     The patient now is extubated with the chest tube removed from the right main
     bronchus.
     
     The large left pleural effusion is unchanged with subsequent atelectasis of
     the adjacent lung.  There is marked irregularity of the pleura especially in
     the upper portion of the left lung, which may represent metastatic deposits.
     There is no prominent mediastinal shift to the right suggesting the underlying
     element of atelectasis of the left lower lobe.
     
     The left lung is clear with no evidence of pleural effusion or congestive
     heart failure.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Large left pleural effusion with prominent irregularity of the pleura and
     subsequent atelectasis of the adjacent lung.
     
     2.  Absence of the prominent mediastinal shift to the right suggests
     underlying atelectasis of the left lower lobe.

Pt was intubated in R mainstem while in ED and taken to CT where increased L lymphadenopathy and nodules were found in L lobe. CxR showed complete whiteout of L lung. OGT was placed and 150cc of old blood aspirated out. Tx to MICU for further treatment and bronchoscopy. 

Neuro: Initially pt was lightly sedated on propofol. However, this was changed to 25mcg/hr fentanyl and 2mg versed at 0600. Pt does not follow commands but is easily arousable. MAE and will reach to pull out tube if hands left unrestrained. Pupils 3mm and reactive bilaterally. 

Resp: Vent settings A/C 400x16/40%/5 Received pt on 100%O2 and have been weaning based on ABG's. Lung sounds coarse in R lung field and diminished in L. Suctioned via ET and got nothing back. Unfortunately, pt's L mainstem is so constricted by tumor she cannot have a bedside bronch. IP will be consulted later today to determine if she can have a rigid bronch. 

Cardiac: Pt in SR with no ectopy throughout night. Occasionally hypotensive with sbp in low 90's while on propofol. But curently running in 110's while on fent/versed. Aline is very positional so she has nbp running q15min as well. 

GI: NGT currently clamped but was on liws for 75cc of old brown blood. No BM this shift. Abd soft but with very hypoactive bowel sounds. 

GU: Voiding 40-100 cc yellow urine via foley. Also receiving D51/2NS at 100/hr x1L. 

Derm: Grossly intact. PIV in L arm patent x2. Aline site benign but waveform quite dampened. 

ID: Afebrile. 

Plan: Consult IP and possible rigid bronch. Sedate to comfort. Family will call for update today. Daughter is HCP name is on board of pt's room. Full Code.

     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Metastatic breast cancer with headaches and vertigo.
     
     Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images of the brain were obtained without and
     with intravenous gadolinium administration.  There are innumerable enhancing
     cerebral and cerebellar lesions consistent with diffuse intracranial
     metastatic disease.  The largest of these lesions are seen within the
     cerebellar hemispheres bilaterally each measuring around 2.7 and 2.5 cm with
     significant surrounding vasogenic edema and mass effect overlying the inferior
     aspect of the fourth ventricle.  There is slight inferior displacement of the
     cerebellar tonsils suggestive of early inferior impending brain herniation.
     There is significant effacement of the posterior mesencephalic cistern due to
     the presence of vasogenic edema.  Multiple other tiny enhancing lesions are
     seen involving the [**Doctor Last Name 30**]/white junction.  The ventricular system is symmetrical
     without hydrocephalus.  No acute territorial infarcts were seen on diffusion
     images.  Normal signal flow voids are present along the intracranial portions
     of the carotid and basilar arteries.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Innumerable enhancing lesions involving both cerebral and
     cerebellar hemispheres consistent with diffuse intracranial metastatic
     disease.  There is vasogenic edema within the occipital lobes and especially
     the cerebellar hemispheres due to larger enhancing metastatic deposits.  There
     is mass effect over the fourth ventricle with slight inferior displacement of
     the cerebellar tonsils.

     FINDINGS:
     
     The innumerable peripherally enhancing masses in the brain parenchyma have
     decreased in size compared to [**2878-9-6**].  The largest lesions remain in the
     cerebellum.  The left cerebellar hemisphere lesion has decreased in size from
     2.2 cm to 1.6 cm.  The lesion at the anterior aspect of the right cerebellar
     hemisphere is decreased from 2.8 to 1.8 cm.  The surrounding vasogenic edema
     has improved.  The fourth ventricle is larger than previously with some
     indentation of it on the left.  There is no hydrocephalus on the current
     study.
     
     IMPRESSION:  There is considerable improvement in the size of the metastases

     CT OF THE CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Multiple enlarged necrotic lymph
     nodes are again identified within the mediastinum, several of which have
     increased in size.  One node within the superior right paratracheal region
     measures approximately 3.3 x 2.6 cm on current examination with prior
     measurement of 2.1 x 2.3 cm.  Lymphadenopathy within the precarinal region
     appears less confluent but also slightly increased in size.  Additional
     lymphadenopathy within the subcarinal region has also increased in size.
     Pericardial lymph nodes appear grossly stable as do right hilar lymph nodes.
     Multiple enlarged lymph nodes are identified within the left axilla in this
     patient status post right mastectomy.  Many of these nodes appear grossly
     stable, however, one node within the left supraclavicular region appears to
     have increased slightly in size measuring approximately 0.9 x 2 cm on today's
     examination.  Left lateral chest wall mass is grossly unchanged in size when
     compared to prior examination measuring approximately 2.8 cm on transverse
     measurement with prior measurement also similar.  Examination of lung
     parenchyma again displays patient to be status post left pleurodesis.  Since
     [**4-18**] examination, the more posterior located loculated effusion has
     decreased in size with the more superior loculated effusion grossly stable.
     The left lung parenchyma displays more confluent opacity involving all the
     remaining parenchyma and numerous air bronchograms are noted.  Examination of
     the right lung parenchyma displays multiple new pulmonary nodules most notable
     within the superior segments of the right upper lobe, with multiple previously
     identified nodules increased in size throughout the remaining lung parenchyma.
     Note is made of a small right-sided pleural effusion.

     portal vein is patent.  The gallbladder is contracted, but appears otherwise
     normal.  The spleen, stomach, intra-abdominal bowel, pancreas, and adrenal
     glands appear grossly normal.  There is stable appearance to two
     hypoattenuating right renal lesions, too small to characterize.  No evidence
     of free air or free fluid within the abdomen.  No pathologically enlarged
     mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes are identified.

     [**4-18**] examination, the more posterior located loculated effusion has
     decreased in size with the more superior loculated effusion grossly stable.
     The left lung parenchyma displays more confluent opacity involving all the
     remaining parenchyma and numerous air bronchograms are noted.  Examination of
     the right lung parenchyma displays multiple new pulmonary nodules most notable
     within the superior segments of the right upper lobe, with multiple previously

     portal vein is patent.  The gallbladder is contracted, but appears otherwise
     normal.  The spleen, stomach, intra-abdominal bowel, pancreas, and adrenal
     glands appear grossly normal.  There is stable appearance to two
     hypoattenuating right renal lesions, too small to characterize.  No evidence
     of free air or free fluid within the abdomen.  No pathologically enlarged
     mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes are identified.
     
     CT THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The distal ureters, bladder, uterus,
     and colon appear grossly unremarkable.  No pathologically enlarged pelvic or
     inguinal lymph nodes are identified.  No free fluid is noted within the
     pelvis.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There has been marked progression of multiple previously
     identified osseous lesions with new sclerotic lesions noted within the sacrum
     as well as increased size to a soft tissue lesion within the right sacrum
     measuring approximately 3.4 x 4.4 cm.  Sclerotic foci within the pelvis also
     appear more prominent as does a lesion involving the right transverse process
     of L5.  Multiple vertebral bodies are noted to contain sclerotic or mixed
     lytic and sclerotic lesions, many of which have increased in size.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Marked progression of metastatic disease with increased size and new
     right-sided pulmonary nodules as well as progression of lymphadenopathy within

     INDICATION:  Breast cancer.  Cough.
     
     There is near complete opacification of the left hemithorax with associated
     ipsilateral shift of the mediastinum towards the left.  This appears to be due
     to a combination of factors including circumferential neoplastic pleural
     involvement, areas of loculated pleural effusion, and a combination of
     atelectasis and consolidation within the left lung.  The right lung is
     slightly overexpanded and demonstrates numerous small pulmonary nodules which
     have increased in size and number compared to the previous examination.  No
     right pleural effusion is evident.  Skeletal structures appear somewhat
     heterogeneous with areas of sclerosis within several left-sided ribs without
     change.
     
     There has been prior right mastectomy.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Near complete opacification of left hemithorax, due to a combination of

     Whole body images of the skeleton were obtained in anterior and posterior  
     projections and compared to the prior study from [**2878-4-11**]. Today's study
     demonstrates progression of the spinal metastatic disease with increased uptake
     noted in multiple thoracic and lumbar vertebrae as well as the pelvis and sacrum
     consistent with findings on recent CT. Previously noted rib metastases,
     including the 7th and 8th on the left and 6th on the right are identified. A new
     focus of activity is seen in the mid-diaphysis of the left tibia. Additionally,
     new foci of uptake are seen within the mid-diaphysis of the right and left
     humeri.    
       
     The kidneys and urinary bladder are visualized, the normal route of tracer
     excretion.

     INDICATION:  Metastatic breast cancer, headaches, vertigo.  Evaluate right
     sacral bone metastasis.
     
     COMPARISONS:  CT torso [**2878-12-21**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial and coronal T1, T2 and T1 fat saturation post-gadolinium
     administration were performed.
     
     MR PELVIS WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST:  Diffuse metastatic lesions are
     identified within the pelvis.  There are areas of signal abnormality
     throughout the pelvis and lower lumbar spine consistent with metastatic
     deposits.
     
     There is a large metastatic lesion within the right side of the sacrum,
     corresponding to the lytic lesion seen on previous CTs.  This lesion extends
     across the midline to involve the left side of the sacrum.  This metastatic
     lesion within the right side of the sacrum completely encircles the right S1
     and S2 neural foramen.  The fat within the foramen are effaced, likely
     indicating compression of the nerves.  The lesion extends up to the sacroiliac
     joint without evidence of involvement of the adjacent ilium.  After contrast
     administration, the majority of the central portion of the tumor does not
     enhance, indicating central necrosis.
     
     Note is also made of a transitional vertebral anatomy involving the lowest
     lumbar vertebral body which articulates with the left side of the sacrum.
     
     Nonspecific edema is identified within the soft tissues along the left lateral
     pelvic wall.  There appears to be a fluid area within the subcutaneous soft
     tissues in this region.  Mild edema is also seen involving the left gluteus
     maximus and medius tendons which may represent myotendinous injury/strain.
     Edema is also seen involving the right gluteus maximus.
     
     Degenerative changes are seen involving the lumbar spine.  There are mild
     degenerative changes involving the pubic symphysis.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Diffuse metastatic disease involving the lower lumbar spine, pelvis, and
     femurs.  Large, centrally necrotic metastatic lesion within the right side of
     the sacrum which crosses midline.  The lesion encircles and effaces the fat
     within the right S1 and S2 neural foramen, likely compressing these nerves.
     2.  Fluid collection identified within the left lateral pelvic wall
     subcutaneous soft tissues, of unknown clinical significance.

     This is a redictation of the report as the original report was lost before
     transcription.  However, the findings on the study were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
     [**Doctor Last Name 354**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1370**] on [**2879-1-20**], at 5 p.m.
     
     PRIOR STUDY:  MR of the lumbar spine done on [**2876-3-18**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging of the lumbar spine was
     performed without contrast.  Contrast was not given due to misinterpretation
     of the protocol, at the time of performing the study.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     There are several areas of altered signal intensity in the lumbar vertebral
     bodies, consistent with metastatic involvement.  There is also involvement of
     the sacral body and the right hemi-sacrum by metastasis, with extension
     through the sacral foramina.  This is however better evaluated on the MRI of
     the hip done the day before, on [**2879-1-18**].
     
     Axial sections were obtained from L2-S1 level.
     
     The metastatic lesions are  better seen on the axial T1-weighted images than
     axial T2-weighted images, which are limited by some motion.
     
     At L4-5 level, there is a 2.1 cm area of altered signal intensity in the right
     side of the superior part of the L5 vertebral body, including the posterior
     margin with possible extension into the spinal canal at this level.  In
     addition, there is a 1.3 x 0.7-cm focus in the right lateral recess, which
     appears to be contiguous with the above-mentioned metastatic focus in the L5
     vertebral body.  However, this was seen on the prior study on [**2876-3-18**], and
     interpreted as disc protrusion.  On the present study, due to lack of IV
     contrast, it is difficult to ascertain whether this represents disc material
     or tumor.  There is possible impingement/encasement of the traversing right L5
     nerve root at this level.  No pre- or para-vertebral soft tissue masses are
     noted. The spinal cord ends at T12-L1 level.  The roots of the cauda equina
     are unremarkable.
     
     The spinal canal at the T11 level, included on the uppermost aspect of the
     field of view, appears unremarkable on the T1-weighted images and increased
                                                                 (Over)

     HISTORY:  Metastatic breast cancer with question lesion L4-L5 on the right
     within the lateral recess.
     
     Routine MRI of the lumbar spine without and with gadolinium was performed.
     
     Comparison is made with prior study of [**2879-1-19**].  Again noted is extensive
     diffuse metastatic involvement of multiple lumbar vertebral bodies as well as
     the sacrum extending to the sacral foramina.  The previously noted soft tissue
     focus in the right lateral recess does not demonstrate convincing enhancement
     and given stability since [**2875**], is felt to represent a focal disc herniation

     INDICATION:  59-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2878-12-21**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT scanning of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was
     performed after oral and intravenous contrast.  Non-contrast images of the
     abdomen and delayed images of the kidneys as well as coronal and sagittal
     reformations were obtained.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST:  There has been an interval increase in size of the left
     supraclavicular paratracheal, subcarinal, precarinal lymphadenopathy. Multiple
     enlarged lymph nodes in the left axilla are also slightly enlarged, as are
     multiple small prevascular lymph nodes.  Patient is status post right
     mastectomy.  There is thickening of the skin over the left breast.  The large
     left lateral chest wall mass also appears slightly larger than on the prior
     study with overall dimensions of 5.7 x 4.3 cm.  Again seen are multiple
     subpleural fluid collections on the left with pleural thickening and
     irregularity surrounding them.  Some of these changes are consistent with the
     prior pleurodesis.  There has been interval worsening of the collapse of the
     left lung with only scattered small regions of aerated lung remaining.  The
     left lower lobe bronchi are obstructed at the segmental level.
     
     The innumerable small pulmonary nodules in the right lung have increased in
     number since the prior study.  The small right-sided pleural effusion is also
     increased in size.
     
     The heart is not enlarged.  There is a small pericardial effusion.  The
     thoracic aorta is of normal caliber.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN:  Since the prior study, the number and size of innumerable
     hypodense liver lesions has increased, involving both lobes.  The portal vein
     and hepatic veins remain patent.  The gallbladder, right adrenal gland,
     spleen, pancreas, kidneys, and bowel appear normal.  There is nodular
     thickening of the left adrenal gland which has increased in size since the
     prior study, now measuring up to 12 mm.  Several small lymph nodes are seen in
     the gastrohepatic ligament up to 8 mm in size.  Several small para-aortic
     lymph nodes are also seen which do not meet criteria for pathologic
     enlargement.  The abdominal aorta is of normal caliber throughout.  There is
     no ascites or free intraperitoneal air.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS:  The bladder, uterus, adnexa and rectum appear unremarkable.
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     (Cont)
     There is a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis, increased since the prior
     study.  No pathologic pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy is appreciated.  In
     the left common femoral vein, there is a central region of lower density.
     
     OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There has been an increase in the number of sclerotic
     metastatic lesions involving several levels of the spine, as well as the
     posterior right fifth vertebral body.  The lytic lesion in the right sacrum
     has a more aggressive appearance since the prior study without is clear, re-
     definable borders.
     
     IMPRESSION:  
     1.  Progression of disease in the chest and abdomen compared to the prior
     study with a substantial increase in the mediastinal lymphadenopathy,
     pulmonary nodules, chest wall mass, and liver lesions.
     2.  Central low density in the left common femoral vein.  This could certainly
     be due to mixing artifact, as the vein at this level is not well opacified.
     Please clinically correlate, with symptoms in the left lower extremity, and if
     clinical concern exists, an ultrasound study of the lower extremity may be of
     value to exclude deep vein thrombosis.

     INDICATION:  59-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2878-12-21**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT scanning of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was
     performed after oral and intravenous contrast.  Non-contrast images of the
     abdomen and delayed images of the kidneys as well as coronal and sagittal
     reformations were obtained.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST:  There has been an interval increase in size of the left
     supraclavicular paratracheal, subcarinal, precarinal lymphadenopathy. Multiple
     enlarged lymph nodes in the left axilla are also slightly enlarged, as are
     multiple small prevascular lymph nodes.  Patient is status post right
     mastectomy.  There is thickening of the skin over the left breast.  The large
     left lateral chest wall mass also appears slightly larger than on the prior
     study with overall dimensions of 5.7 x 4.3 cm.  Again seen are multiple
     subpleural fluid collections on the left with pleural thickening and
     irregularity surrounding them.  Some of these changes are consistent with the
     prior pleurodesis.  There has been interval worsening of the collapse of the
     left lung with only scattered small regions of aerated lung remaining.  The
     left lower lobe bronchi are obstructed at the segmental level.
     
     The innumerable small pulmonary nodules in the right lung have increased in
     number since the prior study.  The small right-sided pleural effusion is also
     increased in size.
     
     The heart is not enlarged.  There is a small pericardial effusion.  The
     thoracic aorta is of normal caliber.

     Reason: Evaluate for increasing metastasis.                         
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      59 year old woman with metastatic breast cancer with falls and lightheadedness. 
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Evaluate for increasing metastasis.                                             
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Metastatic breast cancer with falls and lightheadedness. Evaluate
     for worsening metastases.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2878-10-31**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1-weighted, axial T1-weighted, T2 fast spin echo, FLAIR
     and axial, coronal and sagittal post-gadolinium enhanced images of the brain
     were obtained.  Diffusion-weighted images were also obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:  Again seen are innumerable, some peripherally and others solid
     enhancing masses within the brain parenchyma, little changed from prior study.
     A moderate sized lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere now demonstrates a
     small amount of susceptibility, suggesting either hemorrhage within the
     metastasis or possibly calcification.  Several of the lesions in the right
     cerebellar hemisphere appear slightly decreased in size compared to prior
     study.  The amount of surrounding edema around the metastases does not appear
     significantly changed from prior study.  The remaining lesions do not appear
     significantly changed from the preceding examination.  The lesion seen
     adjacent to the left side of the fourth ventricle seems little altered in
     terms of the degree of compression of the fourth ventricle. Ventricles and
     extraaxial spaces otherwise appear stable.  No new lesions are identified.  No
     abnormal foci of restricted diffusion to suggest evolving infarct are noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Moderate sized metastasis in the left cerebellar hemisphere, now
     demonstrating a small amount of susceptibility, suggesting either hemorrhagic
     metastasis versus calcification that has evolved since the prior study.
     
     2.  No alteration in fourth ventricular compression by contiguous lesion to
     the left of this structure.
     
     Otherwise, little change compared to prior in interval of the other metastases
     seen throughout the brain.  No definite new metastases are identified.
     
     Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2664**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5729**] on [**2879-4-6**], via telephone.
