Admission Date:  [**3455-3-8**]     Discharge Date:  [**3455-3-10**]

Date of Birth:   [**3395-8-6**]     Sex:  M

Service:  [**Company **]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and mental status
change.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59-year-old
male with a history of congestive obstructive pulmonary
disease requiring home O2, schizo-affective disorder and
assaultive behavior.  Is sent from the [**Hospital3 11697**] Home
after the patient became combative, refuses alcohol, and was
noted to be hypoxic.  On presentation to the Emergency
Department, the patient was somnolent and intermittently
arousable, thus unable to provide a significant history or
review of systems, but reports that the patient was noted to
be slightly ""off"" cognitively on [**3-5**].  On [**3-6**],
he had increasing congestion and was started on levofloxacin.

On [**3-7**] and [**3-8**], he became increasingly
combative with decreased O2 saturations 67-70% with O2
noncompliance.  Also he is found to be bleeding from his nose
and mouth, although there was no known trauma.  There is a
history of physical assault from his roommate.  With
worsening sats, he is transferred to the [**Hospital1 74**] Emergency Department for further
evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Schizo-affective disorder.
2. History of assaultive behavior.
3. History of alcohol abuse.
4. Congestive obstructive pulmonary disease on 4 liters O2 at
home with sats in the low 90% range on that.
5. Hypertension.
6. Psoriasis.
7. Genital herpes.
8. Status post anal fistulectomy 20 years ago.
9. Status post tonsillectomy.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature of 98.1,
heart rate 92, blood pressure 125/64, respiratory rate 14,
and O2 saturation is 96% on 30% Ventimask.  Obese, initially
somnolent in the Emergency Department, but improved as
oxygenation improved.  HEENT:  Blood around the mouth and
nares.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.
Neck:  Neck veins flat.  Neck is supple.  Lungs:  Decreased
breath sounds throughout with poor air movement.
Cardiovascular examination:  Regular, rate, and rhythm,
normal, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen is soft,
nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds.  No
organomegaly.  Extremities:  No edema, 2+ pulses.
Neurological examination:  Cranial nerves II through XII are
grossly intact.  Answers in slightly garbled speech, 2+
symmetric reflexes throughout the upper and lower
extremities.  Toes are upgoing bilaterally.  Tone within
normal limits.  Strength is symmetric [**4-23**] throughout.

ADMISSION LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 13.8,
hematocrit 48.1, platelets 187, differential:  81%
neutrophils, 11.9 lymphocytes, 6 monocytes.  Sodium 139,
potassium 4.2, chloride 102, bicarbonate 29, BUN 17,
creatinine 1.0, glucose 97, calcium 10.3, phosphorus 3.0,
magnesium 2.1.  Valproic acid level is 74, tox screen
negative.  Arterial blood gas:  7.32/56/70.

IMAGING:  CT scan of the head:  No gross intracranial
hemorrhage.

CHEST X-RAY:  Bibasilar opacities may represent atelectasis,
but a pneumonic process cannot be excluded.

IMPRESSION:  Patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of
congestive obstructive pulmonary disease and schizo-affective
disorder who presents with increasing cough and worsening
oxygenation.  Brief course of levofloxacin started two days
prior to admission.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit where he received intravenous Solu-Medrol
and nebulizers.  In addition, he was continued on
levofloxacin for suspected pneumonia in the lower lobes.  He
quickly improved, so that he was able to be transferred out
of the MICU to the [**Company **] Medicine service after about six
hours.

On the Medicine service, he was transferred to oral steroids,
and continued on his nebulizers and antibiotics.  He
continued to improve, so that he is now back to his baseline
oxygen saturation on his 4 liters of home oxygen and his
mental status has now returned back to baseline.  He is no
longer combative, and agrees to wear his home oxygen as he
understands that he needs it.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Transferred back to [**Hospital3 11697**]
Home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:

     INDICATION:  Altered mental status, evaluate for pneumonia.
     
     Comparison is made with a chest radiograph from [**3455-1-5**].
     
     AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The heart size and mediastinal contours are unchanged in
     appearance. There is some interval elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, with
     increased opacity in the right lung base, which may indicate atelectasis. A
     pneumonic process cannot be excluded. There is also streaky increased density
     in the left lung base.  Again, this could represent atelectasis, but a
     pneumonic process cannot be excluded.  Osseous structures are unchanged in
     appearance.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities may represent atelectasis, although pneumonia
     cannot be excluded.

     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  Study is extremely limited by patient motion, including absence of

     seen. There is no hydrocephalus. There is preservation of [**Doctor Last Name 30**]/white matter

     No skull fractures or soft tissue swelling are seen.  The visualized portions

     vasculature are stable in appearance.  No pleural effusions or pneumonic
     consolidations are seen.  Again demonstrated are patchy areas of opacity in
     the left lung base, which likely represent atelectasis.
