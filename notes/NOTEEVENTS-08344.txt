HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85-year-old
male with a history of hypertension, hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, prostate cancer, and colon cancer Stage I
status post partial colectomy in [**2513**] presents to the MICU
from the floor for approximately 1600 cc of bright red blood
per rectum.  At transfer, his heart rate was 80, blood
pressure 120/60.  On admission, his pulse was 63-72, blood
pressure 138/70.  He denied lightheadedness, chest pain,
shortness of breath, or any symptoms.  He had the bright red
blood per rectum from 12:45 am to 2:30 am, when he had
already drunk 2 liters of GoLYTELY for colonoscopy prep.  His
hematocrit on admission was 35.3.  At 2:25 pm on the 17th, it
dropped at 33.4.  A 1:10 am on the 18th, floor nurse reported
dark maroon blood per rectum.

The patient initially presented to the Emergency Department
on the [**11-9**] with three days of melena.  He had routine
colonoscopy on the [**10-31**].  Two polyps were excised, one
in the cecum and one 30 cm in the descending colon.  Patient
noted two days of bright red blood on toilet paper following
the procedure.  This changed to melena for three days prior
to admission.  Patient denies any history of diverticulosis.
Denies chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain.  He
denies NSAID or aspirin use greater than 10 days prior to the
colonoscopy.

In the Emergency Department, the patient had a negative upper
GI lavage with 1 liter of normal saline on the floor.  He was
being prepped for colonoscopy with GoLYTELY, started on IV
PPI, and his beta blocker was being held.  The night-float
intern contacted the GI fellow and ordered a TAG red blood
cell scan prior to his admission to the MICU.  The patient
had received 1 unit of packed red blood cells on his transfer
to the MICU.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Colon cancer in [**2513**] status post resection, this is a

This is an 85-year-old male with past medical history of
colon cancer Stage I status post partial colectomy, prostate
cancer, HOCM, hypertension, who presents status post
colonoscopy on the 8th with polypectomy x2 presented to the
Emergency Department with melena and now from the floor with
bright red blood per rectum admitted for workup of the bright
red blood per rectum and observation in the MICU.

1. Bright red blood per rectum:  The patient had a TAG red
blood cell scan which showed active bleeding in the cecum.
The patient then went to angiography on the morning of
transfer, and unfortunately, the area of bleeding was not
visualized.  Later the same day on the 18th, the patient had
a colonoscopy and the GI team was able to find the bleeding
lesion in the cecum, and cauterized it, and injected.

He was transferred from the floor with a hematocrit of 33.4.
He received 1 unit and his hematocrit was 29.7.  On the
morning of the 18th, the patient received another unit,
bumped his hematocrit to 32.1 and it was stable at 31.5 on
the day of discharge.  The patient received intravenous
Protonix while he was NPO.  His aspirin was held.  He also
received no NSAIDs.  Beta blocker was initially held until
the day of discharge.

The patient was instructed to followup with his
gastroenterologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known patient lastname **] approximately one
week following discharge.  He was instructed not to take
NSAIDs, aspirin, or vitamin E.  The patient is instructed if
he had new melena or bright red blood per rectum, to call his
gastroenterologist and come to the Emergency Department.

2. Hypertension/CAD:  Initially, his antihypertensives were
held.  On the day of discharge, the patient was hypertensive
and slightly tachycardic.  The patient's beta blocker was
instituted with decrease in heart rate and blood pressure.
Patient was monitored to rule out any hypotension.  On the
day following the colonoscopy and the bowel prep, the patient
did have blood pressure in the low systolics in the 90s,
responded to IV fluids most likely representing dehydration
in the context of being NPO with a bowel prep and a valvular
lesion that is preload dependent. Following appropriate IV
hydration approximately 3 liters in 24 hours, patient's blood
pressure was stable in the 140s and 150s range.

The patient was instructed to hold his [**Last Name (un) 367**] until the day
following discharge.  The patient was instructed to followup
with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] approximately one week following
discharge.  The patient was instructed to take easy activity
until following up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as per Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 10819**]
instructions.  Patient was continued on his statin.

3. Heme:  Patient's coags were monitored and were within
normal limits.  Platelet count decreased from 167 to
approximately 108, but remained above 100 throughout his
whole hospital stay.

4. Deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis:  The patient was on IV
proton-pump inhibitors and pneumoboots, then converted to a
po proton-pump inhibitors.

Full code.  This is discussed with the patient and
reaffirmed.  He said he wanted everything done.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Lower gastrointestinal bleed secondary to cecal
polypectomy, status post colonoscopy and
intervention/injection, cauterization of the bleeding lesion.
2. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
3. Hypothyroidism.
4. Hypertension.
5. Hypercholesterolemia.
6. Prostate cancer status post TURP x2.
7. Mitral regurgitation.
8. Tricuspid regurgitation.
9. Diastolic dysfunction.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable/good.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  No changes from his outpatient
regimen except the patient was instructed to not take his
aspirin until instructed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and told to take his
metoprolol regimen 50 am and pm and 25 midday.  Instructed
not to start his Avapro until the day following discharge.
He can continue on his normal 10 mg of Lipitor 10 q day,
Synthroid 50 mcg q day.  Instructed to withhold and not take
his vitamin E, and told to avoid all NSAIDs, ibuprofen.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 50**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in a week
following discharge.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      85 year old man with bright red blood per rectum on the floor (1600 cc) s/p 
      presenting with melena x 3 day after a colonoscopy/polepectomy on [**5-31**]..taggged 
      red cell scan loalized bleeding to cecum
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      to stop cecal bleeding

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  85 year old male with bright red blood per rectum.  Patient is
     status post colonoscopy and polypectomy on [**2531-5-31**].  A nuclear medicine scan
     performed earlier this morning demonstrates bleeding in the cecal region.
     
     REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1889**].
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 513**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 696**].  The attending radiologist,
     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 513**], was present and supervising the entire procedure.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:  150 cc Optiray 320 60%.  0.5 mg midazolam.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was described to the patient and
     informed consent was obtained.  Access was gained in the right femoral artery
     using a 19 gauge single wall needle.  A 5 French sheath was then placed in the
     right groin, and a 5 French Omni Flush catheter was advanced to the level of
     the upper aorta.  A flush aortogram was obtained.  This demonstrated patency
     of the celiac, superior and inferior mesenteric vessels.
     
     The infrarenal aorta is moderately tortuous and demonstrates a fair amount of
     vascular calcification.
     
     A lateral arteriogram was obtained following unsuccessful attempts to
     selectively cannulate the vessel in the AP view.  Eventually, a glidewire/SOS
     Omni catheter combination were used to select the superior mesenteric artery,
     and an AP superior mesenteric arteriogram was performed.  This was centered
     over the hepatic flexure.  A second arteriogram was performed, centered over
     the cecum.  We then decided to select both the right ileocolic as well as the
     right colic arteries, using a C2 glide catheter.  Magnification views of these
     vessels demonstrated no evidence for active extravasation or vascular
     malformation.
     
     The catheter was then removed and compression was applied over the right groin
     until hemostasis was achieved.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     [**Last Name (STitle) 513**], staff radiologist who was present and supervised the entire
     procedure.
     
     MEDICATION/CONTRAST:  50 microgram IV Fentanyl, 1 mg IV Versed in divided
     doses under constant hemodynamic monitoring. 80 cc 60% nonionic contrast
     administered due to patient's generalized debilitation.  Vasopressin
     administered intra-arterially at 0.1 units per hour.
     
     TECHNIQUE/PROCEDURE: The patient was informed of the details and associated
     risks of the procedure. Written consent was obtained. The patient was placed
     supine on the angiographic table and the right groin was sterilely prepped and
     draped in the usual fashion. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the right common
     femoral artery was accessed using 19 gauge single wall puncture needle. A 035
     inch [**Location (un) 935**] guidewire was advanced into the abdominal aorta under fluoroscopic
     observation. The puncture needle was exchanged for a 5 French sheath with
     saline side arm flush. A C2 5 French Cobra glide catheter was used to gain
     access to the superior mesenteric artery under fluoroscopic guidance.
     
     Initial arteriogram of the superior mesenteric artery demonstrates
     extravasation within a distal branch of the right colic artery.  The C2 glide
     catheter is then advanced into the take off of the right colic artery and 0.1
     units per minute vasopressin is administered for 15 minutes at which time a
     subsequent arteriogram demonstrated no evidence of extravasation from the
     contrast administration in the region of the previously demonstrated
     extravasation, distal branch of the right colic artery.  There is a small
     amount of spasm of the distal superior distal right colic artery demonstrated
     and the glide catheter is withdrawn to the more proximal right colic artery
     and vasopressin continued to infuse at 0.1 units per minute for several hours
     under close observation and serial abdominal examinations.  Subsequent
                                                                 (Over)

     REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 463**] [**Name (STitle) 6998**].
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Procedure performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3657**] and [**Doctor Last Name 696**] and Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 513**], staff radiologist who was present and supervised the entire
     procedure.
     
     MEDICATION/CONTRAST:  50 microgram IV Fentanyl, 1 mg IV Versed in divided
     doses under constant hemodynamic monitoring. 80 cc 60% nonionic contrast
     administered due to patient's generalized debilitation.  Vasopressin
     administered intra-arterially at 0.1 units per hour.
     
     TECHNIQUE/PROCEDURE: The patient was informed of the details and associated
     risks of the procedure. Written consent was obtained. The patient was placed
     supine on the angiographic table and the right groin was sterilely prepped and
     draped in the usual fashion. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the right common
     femoral artery was accessed using 19 gauge single wall puncture needle. A 035
     inch [**Location (un) 935**] guidewire was advanced into the abdominal aorta under fluoroscopic
     observation. The puncture needle was exchanged for a 5 French sheath with
     saline side arm flush. A C2 5 French Cobra glide catheter was used to gain
     access to the superior mesenteric artery under fluoroscopic guidance.
     
     Initial arteriogram of the superior mesenteric artery demonstrates
     extravasation within a distal branch of the right colic artery.  The C2 glide
     catheter is then advanced into the take off of the right colic artery and 0.1
     units per minute vasopressin is administered for 15 minutes at which time a
     subsequent arteriogram demonstrated no evidence of extravasation from the
     contrast administration in the region of the previously demonstrated
     extravasation, distal branch of the right colic artery.  There is a small
     amount of spasm of the distal superior distal right colic artery demonstrated
     and the glide catheter is withdrawn to the more proximal right colic artery
     and vasopressin continued to infuse at 0.1 units per minute for several hours
     under close observation and serial abdominal examinations.  Subsequent
                                                                 (Over)

O/N pt became tachycardic HR low 100's, given lopressor for increase HR. Hct drawn at that time showing drop of 4pts (Hct 34.6->30.5). Pt started back on Vasopressin 0.1u/min, infusing through Angio site at Colic Artery (site of bleed). Pt was given total of 2u PRBC's this am; pt has now received a total of 10uPRBC's, 1uFFP, 1bag Plt (since his admit on [**6-14**]). Hct after 2units (12pm today)=35.7. Next Hct was to be drawn at 20:00 however IR wanted to check level prior to ?'ably removal of Sheath in R Femoral Artery (currently awaiting results).

Neuro: A/Ox3, is to stay flat in bed for as as long as sheath is in groin, keeping R Leg Straight at all times. Moving upper extremities w/out difficulty. No c/o of abdominal pain, nausea. Overall very pleasant.

CV: HR 72-106 NSR/ST, SBP 106-143/46-48, distal pulses checked q 30mins (pedal as well as femoral), all w/ good palpable pulses. Tmax 99.1, Ca+ repleted this am. 

Resp: 3L NC, O2 sat's high 90's RR ~20, no c/o sob, or chest discomfort. Upper LS clear, lower w/ crackles. Pt does have slight cough, non-productive, given med's w/ little effect.

GI/GU: Cont's to be NPO, +BS, +BM (guiac +, small-scant bm, dark red liquid~20cc; HO aware). U/O wnl, coude catheter in place.

HEME: received 2uPRBC's, Hct 35.7 this afternoon, pndg Hct, next one to be drawn ~12:00MN.

Access: PIV x3, RLA redness. May need new IV this evening. No c/o pain at any of sites.

*ANGIO Catheter: If pt should start to bld and team wants to restart Vasopressin, the concentration of the Vasopressin should be 40u/250cc. It must be this concentration in order for the Vasopressin to be  ""effective"" at the site of the Colonic Artery. This infusion would in turn be running at 37.5cc/hr. 
*ANGIO: Pndg Hct, pt may have Angio sheath pulled back/out this evening, awaiting results.
*Plan: According to MD's pt would not, at this time benefit going down to ANgio again, d/t Angio's inablilty to actually place a coil at the exact site of the bld. Therefore the pt would have to have a Colectomy to remove this site of the bld. 

Skin: Intact

Social: Family in today, very appropriate, updated on pt's condition.
