CT chest/abd/pelvis IMPRESSION:
1. Two right lung masses; one located posteriorly in the right 
upper lobe within the parenchyma, the other located in the right 
hilum. It is unclear if the mass located in the parenchyma 
represents primary tumor in the hilar mass, a nodal met. Other 
nodes are located in the right hilum and within the mediastinum. 
The appearance of these lesions are worrisome for lung 
carcinoma.
2. Small pleural-based lesions within left lung also suspicious 
for malignancy.
3. Pockets of mediastinal air tracking into the soft tissues of 
the neck consistent with patient's recent history of 
bronchoscopy.
4. Low attenuation lesion of right lobe of thyroid indeterminate 
for metastatic lesion.
5. Likely a metastatic lesion of left iliac [**Doctor First Name 456**].

MRI brain: IMPRESSION:
Features most likely due to metastases, bilateral mid frontal, 
right posterior parietal, and dural-based metastasis in the 
anterior part of the tentorium cerebelli.

FNA, Lung, right upper lobe mass at right mainstem bronchus: 
  POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS consistent with non-small cell 
carcinoma. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
67yo male admitted after episode of hemoptysis after bronch at 
[**Hospital 11999**] hospital.  Began treatments for lung CA with XRT.

1) Hemoptysis: After bronch at outside hospital, hematocrit 
remained stable after transfer and bronch here.  No further 
episodes of significant bleeding.

2) Lung CA: Pt had imaging done that showed metastatic disease, 
including to brain.  Biopsy revealed non small cell lung CA.  
Patient started on XRT to chest here.  Plan to get further 
evaluation by pulmonary oncology with treatment plans for after 
XRT to be made.  Will return to get final of 10 total XRT 
treatments next week.

3) Brain Mets: Pt appropriate while here with neuro deficits as 
outlined in physical exam.  Patient had mapping done for planned 
brain XRT.  Patient given dexamethasone 4mg q6 hours while in 
hospital.  Spoke with radiation oncology and decreased to 
dexamethasone 4mg q8 hours on discharge.  Can continue to taper 
up or down as outpatient.

4) Atrial fibrillation: Remained in irregular rhythm while here. 
 Stopped anticoagulation after bleed.  Continue digoxin.  Also 
atenolol decreased to 50mg qday.  No events while in patient.

5) Social: Met with social work while in patient.  Patient 
remains up beat, wants to fight.  Helped to arrange for possible 
transportation to [**Hospital1 83**] in future.  Wants to continue to receive 
care here.

     INDICATION:  67-year-old man with new lung mass, presented with seizures send
     hemoptysis, to evaluate the head mass, likely a metastasis.
     
     PRIOR STUDIES:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted Imaging was performed with IV
     contrast and diffusion-weighted imaging.
     
     FINDINGS:  There are two focal enhancing lesions in the corticomedullary
     junction in bilateral mid frontal regions, the largest on the left side
     measuring 1.2 x 1.1 x 2 cm.  There is moderate perilesional edema.  However,
     there is no evidence of mass effect.  In addition, there is thickening and
     heterogeneous enhancement focally in the anterior tentorium cerebelli
     measuring 1.0 x 0.5 cm, series 10, image 19, series 8, image 10.  This most
     likely represents dural metastasis.  In addition, on the FLAIR images (series
     11, image 20), there is a tiny hyperintense focus in the right posterior
     parietal corticomedullary region with a tiny focus of enhancement on the
     contrast images.  This could represent another focus of metastasis.  The
     ventricles and extra-axial CSF spaces are normal.  The visualized portions of
     the paranasal sinuses and the orbits are unremarkable.  The osseous and the
     soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
     
     On the diffusion-weighted images, no abnormality is noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Features most likely due to metastases, bilateral mid frontal, right posterior
     parietal, and dural-based metastasis in the anterior part of the tentorium
     cerebelli.

     INDICATION:  67-year-old man with new lung mass and head mass with hemoptysis,
     staging for lung mass, likely lung cancer.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contrast-enhanced axial CT images of the thorax, abdomen and
     pelvis were obtained with coronally and sagittally reformatted images.
     
     CT OF THE THORAX WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The right lobe of the thyroid
     demonstrates a low attenuation lesion measuring 16 x 17 mm.  This is not
     adequately characterized and correlation with U/S could be performed .
     Significant right hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy is noted. Mediastinal
     lymphadenopathy is located in the pretracheal and subcarinal areas of the
     mediastinum with smaller lymph nodes noted perivascularly.  No axillary
     lymphadenopathy is identified.  Lung windows reveal at least two definitive
     right lung masses, the first is seen in series 3, image 19, and is located in
     the right upper lobe posteriorly measuring approximately 28 x 19 mm.  Another
     mass measuring 39 x 42 mm in series 3, image 24 is now located in the right
     hilar region, it is heterogeneous in appearance and seems to abut the right
     mainstem bronchus as well as the right side of the carina.  It also likely
     abuts the right pulmonary artery.  It is unclear if this represents primary
     tumor or a nodal metastasis from the previously described right upper lobe
     mass.  Prominent inflammatory change is noted surrounding both of these
     lesions. A pleural-based nodule is seen in the left lung on series 3, image
     48, and measures approximately 6 mm.  Other small areas of focal nodularity
     are located in series 3, image 32 in the left lung abutting the pleura
     posterolaterally as well as within the right middle lobe on series 3 image 41.
     In the right upper lobe, persistence of the azygos fissure is noted with a
     prominent azygos vein within the fissure.   .
     
     Within the mediastinum and tracking into the soft tissues of the neck, several
     small pockets of free air are noted.  These are likely related to patient's
     recent history of bronchoscopy.  The heart demonstrates calcification of the
     coronary arteries.  The pericardium is unremarkable.  The airways appear
     patent to the level of the segmental bronchi bilaterally.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The liver, gallbladder, spleen,
     pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable.  The visualized small
     and large bowel are unremarkable.  Periportal lymph nodes are noted, some of
     which measure up to 1.3 cm in the short axis of unclear clinical significance.
     No retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is noted.  No intra-abdominal free air is
                                                                 (Over)

     seen.  Intra-abdominal soft tissue stranding is noted most significantly
     around the kidneys bilaterally, likely related to mild anasarca.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The rectum, sigmoid colon,
     bladder, and prostate are unremarkable.  Calcification of the internal iliac
     arteries and aorta is identified.  No pathological lymphadenopathy is noted.
     No pelvic free fluid is seen.
     
     SOFT TISSUE AND BONE:  A small ventral fat herniation into the anterior
     abdominal wall is noted.  On series 3, image 86, an approximately 14-mm soft
     tissue nodule is seen posterior to the ilia and is of unclear clinical
     significance.  Bone windows reveal a 16 x 20 mm lytic lesion of the left iliac
     [**Doctor First Name 2055**] with cortical thinning, likely a metastatic lesion.  No other suspicious
     lesions are identified on bone windows.
     
     RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions support the above
     findings.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Two right lung masses; one located posteriorly in the right upper lobe
     within the parenchyma, the other located in the right hilum.  It is unclear if
     the mass located in the parenchyma represents primary tumor in the hilar mass,
     a nodal met.  Other nodes are located in the right hilum and within the
     mediastinum.  The appearance of these lesions are worrisome for lung
     carcinoma.
     
     2.  Small pleural-based lesions within left lung also suspicious for
     malignancy.
     
     3.  Pockets of mediastinal air tracking into the soft tissues of the neck
     consistent with patient's recent history of bronchoscopy.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  67-year-old man with new lung mass and head mass with hemoptysis,
     staging for lung mass, likely lung cancer.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contrast-enhanced axial CT images of the thorax, abdomen and
     pelvis were obtained with coronally and sagittally reformatted images.
     
     CT OF THE THORAX WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The right lobe of the thyroid
     demonstrates a low attenuation lesion measuring 16 x 17 mm.  This is not
     adequately characterized and correlation with U/S could be performed .
     Significant right hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy is noted. Mediastinal
     lymphadenopathy is located in the pretracheal and subcarinal areas of the
     mediastinum with smaller lymph nodes noted perivascularly.  No axillary
     lymphadenopathy is identified.  Lung windows reveal at least two definitive
     right lung masses, the first is seen in series 3, image 19, and is located in
     the right upper lobe posteriorly measuring approximately 28 x 19 mm.  Another
     mass measuring 39 x 42 mm in series 3, image 24 is now located in the right
     hilar region, it is heterogeneous in appearance and seems to abut the right
     mainstem bronchus as well as the right side of the carina.  It also likely
     abuts the right pulmonary artery.  It is unclear if this represents primary
     tumor or a nodal metastasis from the previously described right upper lobe
     mass.  Prominent inflammatory change is noted surrounding both of these
     lesions. A pleural-based nodule is seen in the left lung on series 3, image
     48, and measures approximately 6 mm.  Other small areas of focal nodularity
     are located in series 3, image 32 in the left lung abutting the pleura
     posterolaterally as well as within the right middle lobe on series 3 image 41.
     In the right upper lobe, persistence of the azygos fissure is noted with a
     prominent azygos vein within the fissure.   .
     
     Within the mediastinum and tracking into the soft tissues of the neck, several
     small pockets of free air are noted.  These are likely related to patient's
     recent history of bronchoscopy.  The heart demonstrates calcification of the
     coronary arteries.  The pericardium is unremarkable.  The airways appear
     patent to the level of the segmental bronchi bilaterally.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The liver, gallbladder, spleen,
     pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable.  The visualized small
     and large bowel are unremarkable.  Periportal lymph nodes are noted, some of
     which measure up to 1.3 cm in the short axis of unclear clinical significance.
     No retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is noted.  No intra-abdominal free air is
                                                                 (Over)

     around the kidneys bilaterally, likely related to mild anasarca.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The rectum, sigmoid colon,
     bladder, and prostate are unremarkable.  Calcification of the internal iliac
     arteries and aorta is identified.  No pathological lymphadenopathy is noted.
     No pelvic free fluid is seen.
     
     SOFT TISSUE AND BONE:  A small ventral fat herniation into the anterior
     abdominal wall is noted.  On series 3, image 86, an approximately 14-mm soft
     tissue nodule is seen posterior to the ilia and is of unclear clinical
     significance.  Bone windows reveal a 16 x 20 mm lytic lesion of the left iliac
     [**Doctor First Name 2055**] with cortical thinning, likely a metastatic lesion.  No other suspicious
     lesions are identified on bone windows.
     
     RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions support the above
     findings.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Two right lung masses; one located posteriorly in the right upper lobe
     within the parenchyma, the other located in the right hilum.  It is unclear if
     the mass located in the parenchyma represents primary tumor in the hilar mass,
     a nodal met.  Other nodes are located in the right hilum and within the
     mediastinum.  The appearance of these lesions are worrisome for lung

     RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA:
        20.7 mCi F-18 FDG ([**2900-8-18**]);
     INDICATION:  68 year old male with non-small cell lung cancer. 
      
     METHODS: Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration of F-18 
     fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), noncontrast CT images were obtained for attenuation
     correction and for fusion with emission PET images. [The noncontrast CT images
     are not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.]  A series of
     overlapping emission PET images was then obtained. The fasting blood glucose
     level, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was 92 mg/dL. The area
     imaged spanned the region from the skull base to the mid thigh. 
      
     Computed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused with emission PET
     images to assist with the anatomic localization of tracer uptake.  The
     determination of the site of tracer uptake seen on PET data can have important
     implications regarding the significance of that uptake. 
      
     INTERPRETATION:  There is no FDG avid disease in the head and neck. In the right
     upper lobe, a 25 x 15 mm solid, spiculated mass ([**12/2851**]) is strongly FDG avid
     with a max SUV of 16.7 and appears slightly larger than on prior CT dated
     [**2900-7-19**]. Surrounding subpleural cystic change is also FDG avid with a max SUV of
     2.8.  Bulky right perihilar lymphadenopathy  has a max SUV of 14.2.  Low level
     FDG avidity associated with a 14 x 11 mm lobulated nodule adjacent to the right
     minor fissure ([**12/2867**]) has a max SUV of 2.5. Increased FDG avidity is seen
     diffusely in the right middle lobe with a max SUV of 2.7.   
      
     In the left lung, an 8 mm subpleural nodule in the left lower lobe ([**12/2877**]) and a
     nodule in the left lung base ([**12/2884**]) are not FDG avid. Increased FDG avidity is
     associated with a diffuse region of paraseptal thickening and nodularity in the
     left upper lobe, with a max SUV of 3.6. Multiple prominent mediastinal lymph
     nodes are mildly FDG avid.  A representative subcarinal lymph node ([**12/2861**])
     measures 17 mm in short axis and has a max SUV of 3.0. 
      
     Below the diaphragm, a single FDG avid, soft tissue density lesion in the right
     buttock subcutaneous fat measures 1 cm (2/136), with a max SUV of 15.8.  A 9mm
     soft tissue density lesion in the spinal canal (2/142) and adjacent to the left
     S1 nerve root has a max SUV of 16.4.  A 26 x 17 mm left iliac bone lesion
     (2/150) has a max SUV of 26.6. 
      
     CT images demonstrate a lytic appearing focus in the occipital bone is not FDG
     avid and likely represents a venous [**Doctor Last Name **].  Additional CT findings include: mild
     mucosal thickening in the right maxillary sinus, dense atherosclerosis and
     coronary artery calcifications, gynecomastia, a small umbilical hernia,
     gallstones, mild edema in the surrounding soft tissues. 
      
     Physiologic uptake is seen in the imaged brain, salivary glands, larynx, liver,
     GI and [**Hospital Unit Name 755**] systems.

     INDICATION:  68-year-old man with lung cancer, brain cancer, now shortness of
     breath.  
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2900-8-18**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT scanning of the chest was performed before and
     after the administration of intravenous contrast.  Multiplanar reformations
     were obtained.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST:  No central or segmental filling defects are identified
     within the pulmonary arteries to suggest embolism.  The heart is mildly
     enlarged.  The pericardium appears unremarkable.  The bulky right hilar mass
     is again seen, narrowing the right mainstem bronchus, and encasing the
     pulmonary vessels. Multiple mediastinal nodes are stable in appearance.  There
     has been an increase in the moderate left pleural effusion, and there is a new
     small right pleural effusion.
     
     Multifocal consolidative opacities are new, and there is progression of the
     previously seen ground glass opacities, involving the left upper lobe, the
     right middle lobe, both lower lobes. A more nodular region of opacity is seen
     in the right upper lung measuring 1.7 cm, best seen on series 3, image 21, in
     the region of prior FDG avidity.
     
     The superior aspect of the liver, stomach, and spleen appear unremarkable.
     
     OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  No concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified. 
     
     IMPRESSION:  
     1.  Multifocal consolidative and ground glass opacities consistent with
     pneumonia.
     2.  Right hilar mass narrowing the right mainstem bronchus, and right upper
     lobe nodule again seen.
     3.  No evidence of central or segmental pulmonary embolism.
     4.  Increase in the size of bilateral pleural effusions.
                                                                 (Over)

     STUDY:  Single portable AP chest radiograph.
     
     INDICATION:  67-year-old male with known right lung lesion, now presenting
     with hemoptysis and shortness of breath.
     
     COMPARISON:  Single portable AP chest radiograph [**2900-7-20**].
     
     FINDINGS:  New confluent patchy opacity identified within the entire left lung
     field and right lower lobe.  Given the relative asymmetric nature with sparing
     in the right upper lobe, multilobar pneumonia more likely, with diffuse
     pulmonary hemorrhage less likely.  No definite pleural effusions or
     pneumothoraces are identified.

     TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP upright radiograph was compared with
     examination from three days ago.
     
     FINDINGS:  There has been slight interval improvement in the right lower lobe
     peripheral opacity, although there has been slight interval worsening of
     opacities seen at the left lung apex.  The remainder of the lung fields
     appears essentially unchanged since the prior examination with confluent
     opacity seen involving the entire left lung and the right lower lobe.
     
     IMPRESSION: Overall, the severity of opacities is not significantly changed
     since the prior study.
