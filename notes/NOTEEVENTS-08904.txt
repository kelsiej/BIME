CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**3367-2-8**] 10:36 AM--previously seen Pneumonia 
has cleared

*
GI STUDIES: 
[**1-21**] EGD- 4 cords of grade III varices were seen starting at 30 
cm from the incisors in the lower third of the esophagus. There 
were stigmata of recent bleeding. 3 bands were successfully 
placed. Localized mosaic appearance of the mucosa was noted in 
the fundus. These findings are compatible with portal 
gastropathy
*
[**1-21**] 2nd EGD- Varices were seen in the esophagus. They were not 
actively bleeding. The 3 previous bands were still present and 
secure. There was no bleeding from this area. The varices 
extended from the GE jcn to approximately 20 cm
.
[**1-30**] 3rd EGD - 4 cords of grade II-III varices were seen in the 
middle third of the esophagus and lower third of the esophagus. 
The varices were not bleeding. No previously placed bands were 
found. A small ulcer on a previously banded site was present. 4 
bands were successfully placed.  Diffuse erythema, granularity 
and mosaic appearance of the mucosa with no bleeding were noted 
in the stomach. These findings are compatible with portal 
gastropathy.  
*
[**2-9**] 4th EGD - Grade II varices seen in middle third of esophagus 
and lower third of esophagus. Varices not bleeding. Ulceration 
seen on previously banded sights in lower third. Too soon to 
repeat banding, will need repeat EGD in ~10 days.

Brief Hospital Course:
At the outside hospital, the patient was initially noted to have 
significant metabolic acidosis (ABG 7.15/15/200; bicarb < 10). 
Systolic BP in the 60s. Hct 20. O2 saturation 84% on 100% NRB. 
Patient was intubated to protect his airway given his mental 
status changes, given 3 U PRBCS, 2 FFP, and started on 
octeotride gtt. He was also given 5units IV insulin, 1 amp D50, 
1 amp bicarb, and transferred to [**Hospital1 83**] for urgent EGD and ICU 
care. 
.
#GI BLEED: 
The initial EGD done in the ER at [**Hospital1 83**] showed 3 varices, 1 
bleeding. The patient had all 3 varices banded. He was also 
transfused an additional 1 U PRBC and 1 U FFP.  The patient was 
transferred to the ICU and on HD#1 vomited > 500 cc bright red 
blood. A repeat endoscopy revealed bands still in place and no 
further active bleeding seen. His Hct stabilized at 26.0 up from 
24 on arrival and up from 20 at [**Hospital1 **].  Another EGD 
on HD#10 showed non-bleeding varicies and 4 additional bands 
were placed.  The patient was maintained on protonix and nadolol 
to control his portal hypertension.  The plan was made for the 
patient to have another EGD performed on [**3367-2-9**] to assess the 
need for more banding. This study was performed and showed 
continued varices in esophagus and ulceration on one of the 
previously banded areas but no active bleeding. The patient will 
have another EGD in approximately 10 days to reassess. In the 
interim he will remain on protonix and carafate. 
.
#BACTEREMIA:
The patient developed hypotension and fever, thought to be 
secondary sepsis, therefore patient was pancultured, revealing 
two different morphologies of MRSA from sputum and blood as well 
as 1/2 bottles of enterococcal bacteremia. Patient was started 
on pressors including neosynephrine, vasopressin, as well as 
octreotide for hepatorenal syndrome. Following clearing of blood 
cultures, however, patient's blood pressure began to stabilize, 
and patient was weaned off pressors on hospital day 4.  He did 
not have any further bouts of hypotension and his last positive 
cultures were from [**3367-1-23**].  He was given a 14 day course of 
vancomycin, levofloxacin, and flagyl. The patient remains 
afebrile now >72 hours after Abx. His sputum continues to show 
MRSA, however, and he is considered to be colonized with this 
bacteria. He requires no antibiotic coverage at the time of 
discharge. 
.
#HEPATIC:  The patient was followed by the hepatology team.
-ASCITES: The patient had no signs/symptoms of SBP, but was 
covered prophylactically for SBP organisms during his hospital 
stay.  He was diuresed with lasix and aldactone.  A paracentesis 
was done for symptomatic relief on [**3367-2-4**], and six liters of 
fluid were removed.
-ENCEPHALOPATHY: MELD=26, on transplant list. The patient was on 
lactulose with the goal of 4-5 bowel movements per day.  He had 
variability of his mental status during the course of his 
hospital stay. At the time of discharge he is alert, oriented 
and appropriate. 
.
#THROMBOCYTOPENIA: 
Most likely due to liver dysfunction.  There was no evidence for 
hemolysis.  Platelet count has remained stable, but low. The 
patient had no evidence of bleeding at time of discharge.

#RENAL:
The patient had ARF and acidosis on admission.  This appeared to 
be of pre-renal by electrolytes.  The patient had BRBPR s/p 
banding. Creatinine during his hospitalization was between 
1.9-2.1 (baseline creatinine 1.4-1.8).  This acute on chronic 
renal failure was thought to be due to either hepatorenal 
syndrome or ATN secondary to hypotension.  The creatinine did 
not change with resolution of the hypotension nor with 
initiation of diuretics.  He was initially started on the 
hepatorenal protocol (albumin/midodrine/SC octreotide) which was 
stopped on [**3367-1-28**] (midodrine was started on [**3367-1-25**]). There was 
no evidence of HUS/TTP (no shistocytes).  A renal ultrasound 
normal showed no hydronephrosis.  He was continued on lasix and 
aldactone. Creatinine at time of discharge was 2.0

#DENTAL INFECTION:
The patient complained of bilateral mandibular molar pain and 
was seen by dentistry.  The dental consultant recommended an 
oral surgery consult for tooth extraction.  Molars #17 and #18 
were extracted without complications.

     COMPARISON:  Same date at 1:25 p.m.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable supine chest.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     An endotracheal tube is in place with tip terminating approximately 2.5 cm in
     the carina.  Right internal jugular venous access catheter has been placed in
     the interval with tip terminating in the distal SVC.  The previously present
     nasogastric tube is not visualized.  The left costophrenic angle is excluded
     from the radiograph.  No definite evidence of pneumothorax is visualized,
     although in the supine position, a small pneumothorax could possibly layer
     anteriorly at the left base.  No focal pulmonary parenchymal consolidation is
     identified.  Note is again made of multiple right-sided posterior rib
     fractures and bilateral clavicular fractures.  There is again seen gastric
     distention of the stomach.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Status post placement of left internal jugular venous access catheter with
     tip in distal SVC.  Nasogastric tube removed.  Endotracheal tube in unchanged
     position.
     
     2)  No definite evidence of pneumothorax, although exclusion of left
     costophrenic angle from the radiograph limits sensitivity for detection of a
     small left-sided pneumothorax in the supine position.  Recommend repeat chest
     xray with inclusion of this area.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  A 49-year-old man with hepatitis C cirrhosis status post variceal
     bleed, status post left central line placement.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
     
     COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with a prior AP supine portable chest x-ray
     dated [**3367-1-21**].
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     AP supine portable chest x-ray:  An endotracheal tube is seen in good position
     approximately 2 cm superior to the carina.  A left subclavian central venous
     catheter is seen terminating in the proximal/mid superior vena cava.  There is
     no definite evidence of pneumothorax. Again, a small pneumothorax can be
     layering anteriorly with the patient in the supine position.  When compared
     with prior study, the cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar silhouettes are stable. 
     Pulmonary vasculature is normal bilaterally.  There is no evidence of focal
     pulmonary parenchymal consolidation identified.  Note is again made of
     multiple right-sided posterior rib fractures and bilateral clavicular
     fractures.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  The patient is status post placement of a left internal jugular venous
     catheter.  No definite pneumothorax is seen, however, a small layering
     pneumothorax could not be excluded with the patient in the supine position. 
     Recommend upright portable chest x-ray when patient is able.
     
     2)  No significant interval change in appearance of the chest when compared
     with prior study approximately 1 day earlier.

     white blood cell count and bandemia.
     
     LIVER DOPPLER ULTRASOUND:  The exam is limited due to marked respiratory
     motion.  Normal hepatopetal flow is present within the portal vein.  Normal
     color flow and wave forms are demonstrated within the hepatic veins.  Limited
     analysis of the main hepatic artery is unremarkable.  The liver demonstrates
     coarsened echotexture and appears to have a nodular contour, consistent with
     given history of cirrhosis.  There is no intra or extrahepatic ductal
     dilatation.  The common bile duct measures 5 mm.  The gallbladder is enlarged
     but is otherwise unremarkable.  The right kidney measures 10.9 cm and is
     normal.  The pancreatic head is unremarkable.
     
     Four quadrant examination of the abdomen demonstrates a moderate amount of
     ascites.  A large pocket of fluid is demonstrated at the midline suprapubic
     region.  The bladder is collapsed and contains a Foley.  A spot was marked in
     the midline suprapubic region appropriate for paracentesis to be performed by
     the clinical team.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Limited Doppler examination with normal portal venous and hepatic venous
     flow.
     2)  Coarsened liver echotexture and nodular contour consistent with cirrhosis.

     INDICATION:  A 49-year-old man with hepatitis C cirrhosis and gastrointestinal
     bleeding, status post intubation.  Routine check x-ray and intubated patient.
     
     COMPARISON:  Made with a prior AP supine portable chest x-ray dated
     [**3367-1-22**].
     
     AP SEMI-ERECT PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY:  An endotracheal tube is seen in good
     position terminating approximately 2 cm superior to the carina.  A left-sided
     internal jugular central venous catheter is seen terminating in the middle
     superior vena cava.  The cardiac, and mediastinal contours appear stable.
     There is mild interval prominence of bilateral hilar, especially on the right,
     possibly representing lymphadenopathy.  Pulmonary vasculature bilaterally is
     stable and within normal limits.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  No
     new infiltrates, effusions, or consolidations are seen.  Again note is made of
     multiple right-sided posterior rib fractures and bilateral clavicular
     fractures.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Interval development of fullness of bilateral hila, particularly the right
     hilum, most likely representing lymphadenopathy.  Continued followup is
     recommended.
     
     2)  Lines and tubes in good position as indicated above.
     
     3)  No new infiltrates, effusions, or consolidations.

     The procedure was explained in detail with the patient, including the
     potential risks and benefits.  Signed consent was then obtained.  A
     preprocedure timeout was employed to verify the patient's identity and the
     planned procedure site.
     
     DIAGNOSTIC PARACENTESIS:  An appropriate spot was marked on the skin of the
     right lower quadrant, using sonographic localization.  The area was then
     prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was
     achieved with 1% lidocaine.  Using continuous sonographic guidance, a 19-gauge
     catheter was inserted into the fluid.  Approximately 250 cc of clear, straw
     colored fluid was aspirated.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without
     any immediate post-procedure complications.
     
     A sample of the fluid was immediately sent for the requested laboratory
     analysis.
     
     Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 821**], the staff radiologist, was present and supervised the entire
     procedure.

     PORTAL VENOUS ULTRASOUND:  [**Doctor Last Name **] scale, color flow, and Doppler images of the
     portal vein and branches, hepatic veins and IVC were obtained.  All vessels
     are patent and demonstrate normal flow.  The hepatic arteries demonstrate
     normal arterial flow, with resistive indices ranging from 0.7-0.72.  The
     gallbladder wall is edematous and the gallbladder itself appears shrunken. 
     The common bile duct is not dilated, measuring 4 mm.  There is a large amount
     of intraabdominal ascites, which has significantly increased since prior study
     dated [**3367-3-19**].
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Normal arterial waveforms in hepatic arteries, with resistive indices at

     INDICATION:  Cirrhosis with worsening abdominal distention.  Liver transplant
     evaluation.
     
     TECHNIQUE:
     
     Multiplanar T1 and T2-weighted images were obtained, followed by dynamic 3D
     imaging acquired prior to, during, and after gadolinium injection.
     
     Multiplanar reformations were generated and evaluated on the workstation.
     
     COMPARISON:  No MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] comparisons available.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     The liver shows cirrhotic features with morphologic redistribution including
     markedly enlarged caudate lobe.  There is capsule retraction at segment 4, an
     area of low signal that enhances on delayed contrast images, findings
     consistent with confluent hepatic fibrosis.  No discrete mass lesions were
     identified.  In segment 7 of the liver, there is a peripheral wedge shaped
     area of increased enhancement during arterial phase, which is likely a
     shunting phenomenon as no focal mass lesion was seen in this area.  This
     region can be surveyed on subsequent follow up studies.
     
     The portal venous system is patent and hepatopedal flow was demonstrated.
     There is a large amount of ascites and copious amount of varices visualized
     including para esophageal varices.  Of note, the esophagus appears somewhat
     thickened and one might consider endoscopic or upper GI correlation.
     
     The gallbladder is distended but showed no evidence for stones or wall
     thickening.  The CBD was normal.  The pancreas and pancreatic duct appeared
     normal.
     
     The spleen, adrenal glands, pancreas, and kidneys appeared normal.
     
     There is conventional arterial anatomy with segment 4 being supplied from
     branch of the common hepatic artery.
     
     Multiplanar reformations were essential in delineating the vascular anatomy
     and in generating liver following calculations.

     was performed verifying the identity of the patient, the patient's date of
     birth and the procedure to be performed.  Initial ultrasonographic imaging
     demonstrates a large amount of ascites with a prominent ascitic pocket located
     in the right lower quadrant.  After selection of a suitable site for
     paracentesis using ultrasound guidance, the skin of the right lower quadrant
     was prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was
     achieved via injection of 4 cc of 1% lidocaine.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1199**] catheter was advanced
     into the ascitic fluid and 7 liters of serous, yellow-greenish fluid were
     aspirated.  Samples were sent to cytology, microbiology and hematology, as
     requested by the clinical service.  The patient tolerated the procedure well,
     with no complications evident at the time of the procedure.
     
     The attending radiologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 821**], was present and supervising throughout

     LIMITED ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND SCAN (RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT)
     
     Marking for abdominal paracentesis.
     
     CLINICAL DETAILS:
     
     Alcohol-related liver cirrhosis with intra-abdominal ascites.  Right upper
     abdominal pain.
     
     Comparison is made to recent ultrasound of [**3367-10-23**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The liver is shrunken with a nodular surface contour in keeping
     with underlying cirrhotic change, no focal lesion demonstrated.
     
     The main portal vein is patent with normal directional flow(colour scale
     inverted).
     No intra or extrahepatic biliary dilatation, mild(3-4mm) circumferential
     thickening of the gallbladder body wall, may be secondary to the presence of
     large amount of intra-abdominal ascites or chronic liver disease.  No
     gallstones demonstrated.
     
     Large amount of intra-abdominal ascites similar in size of recent ultrasound.
     
     As requested, a cutaneous ink mark was placed over the right lower quadrant
     laterally at the site of maximal depth of ascites to facilitate paracentesis.

     located within the duodenum, but the tip was facing cephalad within the bulb.
     A tiny wire was placed into the feeding tube, and the feeding tube was
     adjusted such that the tip was now lying within the third portion of the
     duodenum.  This was all performed under fluoroscopic guidance, and position
     was confirmed after the administration of a small amount of Conray contrast.

     HISTORY:  Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis with nausea and tender abdomen.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired contiguous axial images from the lung bases to pubic
     symphysis were obtained following administration of oral contrast only.  No IV
     contrast was administered secondary to the patient's elevated creatinine of
     2.2.  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were performed.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Mild dependent atelectatic changes are
     seen at the lung bases.
     
     A small amount of ascites is seen within the abdomen, predominantly in the
     perihepatic region. The liver is shrunken in size with a nodular contour,
     consistent with cirrhosis. There is no evidence of a focal hepatic mass. There
     is no intra or extrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. The gallbladder wall is
     edematous, but the gallbladder is not distended and no calcified gallstones
     are seen.  The pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands are unremarkable. There is
     mild bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureter without evidence of renal
     calculi, definite renal mass, or perinephric stranding.
     
     A feeding tube is seen, which is looped within the stomach.  The stomach is
     massively distended with air and fluid.  The remaining loops of small bowel
     containing contrast are not dilated.  There is some thickening of the duodenal
     wall, likely related to the patient's underlying liver failure. Small
     subcentimeter lymph nodes are seen within the mesentery and retroperitoneum,
     none of which meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement. There is no free
     air.  The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber and contains scattered mural
     calcifications.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The bladder is markedly distended.  No
     bladder calculi or bladder wall thickening is seen.  Pelvic loops of bowel are
     within normal limits.  There is diffuse anasarca.  No pelvic or inguinal
     lymphadenopathy is present.  Trace amount of free fluid is seen within the
     pelvis.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are present. A
     compression fracture of the L1 vertebral body is present.

     INDICATIONS:  50-year-old man with alcoholic cirrhosis and gastrointestinal
     bleeding.  IV therapy was not able to advance a PICC line at the bedside.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 11580**] [**Name (STitle) 4**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6**], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6**], the Attending Radiologist, being present and
     supervising. The right upper arm was prepped in a sterile fashion.  Since no
     suitable superficial veins were visible, ultrasound was used for localization
     of a suitable vein. Ultrasonographic images acquired prior to and following
     insertion of the PICC line were stored as hard copies.  A right brachial vein
     was found to be patent and compressible.  After local anesthesia with 2 cc of
     1% lidocaine, the right brachial vein was entered under ultrasonographic
     guidance with a 21- gauge needle.  A 0.018 guide wire was advanced under
     fluoroscopy into the superior vena cava.  Based on the markers on the guide
     wire, it was determined that a length of 37 cm would be suitable.  The PICC
     line was trimmed to that length and advanced over a 4-French introducer sheath
     under fluoroscopic guidance into the superior vena cava.  The sheath was
     removed and the catheter was flushed.  A final fluoroscopic spot view
     demonstrated that the tip lies in the superior vena cava.  The line is ready
     for use.  A statlock was applied, and the line was heplocked.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of 37 cm, total length 4-French single lumen
     PICC line, with the tip in the superior vena cava, ready for use.

     INDICATIONS:  50-year-old man with alcoholic cirrhosis and gastrointestinal
     bleeding.  IV therapy was not able to advance a PICC line at the bedside.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 11580**] [**Name (STitle) 4**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6**], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6**], the Attending Radiologist, being present and
     supervising. The right upper arm was prepped in a sterile fashion.  Since no
     suitable superficial veins were visible, ultrasound was used for localization
     of a suitable vein. Ultrasonographic images acquired prior to and following
     insertion of the PICC line were stored as hard copies.  A right brachial vein
     was found to be patent and compressible.  After local anesthesia with 2 cc of
     1% lidocaine, the right brachial vein was entered under ultrasonographic
     guidance with a 21- gauge needle.  A 0.018 guide wire was advanced under
     fluoroscopy into the superior vena cava.  Based on the markers on the guide
     wire, it was determined that a length of 37 cm would be suitable.  The PICC
     line was trimmed to that length and advanced over a 4-French introducer sheath
     under fluoroscopic guidance into the superior vena cava.  The sheath was
     removed and the catheter was flushed.  A final fluoroscopic spot view
     demonstrated that the tip lies in the superior vena cava.  The line is ready
     for use.  A statlock was applied, and the line was heplocked.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of 37 cm, total length 4-French single lumen
     PICC line, with the tip in the superior vena cava, ready for use.
