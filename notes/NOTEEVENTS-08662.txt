Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1089**] 
Chief Complaint:
Hematochezia

History of Present Illness:
85 y/o female with PMH significant for HTN, 
hypercholesterolemia, MCA CVA in [**11/2578**], and two past GI bleeds 
(most recent was hematochezia during hospitalization for CVA) 
admitted from nursing home after passing approximately half a 
cup of blood from her rectum. Pt reports no concerning GI 
symptoms prior to this since [**0-**]/2004. During this 
previous bleed, the pt required transfusion of 9-10 units of 
PRBC. Colonosocpy at this time was notable for diverticulosis 
but no acute bleeding. A tagged red cell scan showed the source 
of bleeding to be the hepatic flexure of her colon. Pt was 
followed up in GI clinic on [**2579-3-2**] at which time it was felt 
that she was doing well and a repeat colonoscopy was not 
indicated. In further ROS, pt reports that she had been doing 
well otherwise. No fevers or chills. No lightheadedness or 
dizziness. No CP, SOB, or cough. Pt denied a change in appetite. 
In the [**Hospital1 83**] ED, pt's NG lavage was negative and she had a 
watery, guaiac negative stool. At that time, the pt was admitted 
to the medicine service for further care.

A GI consult was obtained on admission. It was felt that given 
the pt's presentation and history, she most probably had a lower 
GI bleed due to diverticulosis. Pt was started on IV protonix 
BID. Her Hct on admission was 35.9. On the night of admission, 
pt had another episode of BRBPR associated with lightheadedness. 
At that time, she was transfused 1 unit of PRBC and the pt was 
transferred to the MICU. A surgical consult was obtained and 
they followed the pt. A tagged red blood cell scan was also 
obtained which showed no active areas of bleeding. On the 
morning of 12/01, an EGD was done which showed a Schatzki's ring 
at the GE junction but no bleeding. A colonoscopy was 
significant for dark red blood in the rectum, sigmoid colon, and 
descending colon. Multiple non-bleeding diverticula were seen in 
the sigmoid colon. Another tagged red blood cell scan was then 
obtained which showed bleeding at the hepatic flexure felt to be 
coming from the right colic or middle colic artery. However, 
subsequent angio was negative so no embolization was preformed. 
Over the last one and a half days, pt's Hct has been fairly 
stable ranging between 28.2 and 30.9. She has had no further 
episodes of BRBPR. Since admission, pt has been transfused a 
total of 6 units of PRBC. 
Colonoscopy today ([**11-26**]) was normal.

Tagged RBC scan [**2579-11-24**]:Active gastrointestinal bleeding 
localized to the hepatic flexure

 
Brief Hospital Course:
1.GI: The pt seen by GI in ED.  She had a h/o lower GIB 
attributed to diverticulosis. This seemed to be the case on 
admission. Had not had bleeding since episode at [**Hospital1 1745**] when we 
evaluated her.  The plan was to check q6h Hcts and to keep her 
NPO other than Golytely bowel prep overnight for colonoscopy in 
the morning.  She was asymptomatic.  Also started bid protonix.  
However, she began to have moderately brisk BRBPR, associated 
with the bowel prep.  She received a unit of PRBCs and was 
lightheaded, so she had a tagged RBC scan which did not show 
source of bleeding. She was transferred to MICU for monitoring, 
but remained stable.  In the unit, she had an EGD which did not 
show bleeding, and a colonoscopy which showed blood in sigmoid 
and descending colon along with diverticuli.  A repeat tagged 
RBC scan showed source at hepatic flexure(same as previous bleed 
in January), but a follow-up angio did not reveal a source, so 
no embolization was performed.  Repeat colonoscopy two days 
later showed multipls diverticuli throughout colon, but no 
active bleeding.  At this point, pt transferred to floor where 
her Hct was checked twice daily.  It remained stable in the low 
30s, and she had no further bleeding on the floor. She was 
transferred back to her nursing home after 6 days without 
bleeding and a stable Hct.  She was afebrile.  Per surgery team, 
most surgeons have a cut-off for rate of bleeding before 
performing colectomy for this problem.  This is usually a 
cut-off of 5-6 units over 24 hours.  This pt required a total of 
6 units over her 4 day MICU stay. Her BP was always stable.
In addition, pt found to have Schatzki's Ring in esophagus. Keep 
in mind if pt begisn to experience dysphagia. GI follow-up as 
below. Surgery follow-up as below.

2. HTN: Her BP was elevated with SBP 170 when she came out of 
the unit. It remained this way for a day as we were holding her 
BP meds in case she bled again.  When this proved to not be the 
case, her ACE-I was restarted and corrected her BP. It was not 
quite back into a normal range, with SBPs of 140, and her Lasix 
should be restarted at some point to hopefully bring her 
pressure back to normal if needed.  Also, if she has symptomatic 
LE edema, the Lasix may be useful to restart.  Her statin was 
continued throughout.

3.Psych:We continued her celexa and xanax initially.  When she 
went to the unit, her xanax was stopped and not restarted when 
she came back to floor.  She had 2 nights of delirium after 
coming from unit.  At this time, her prn pain med was decreased 
and her xanax qhs was restarted.  She did not have any 
additional delirium while here and returned to her normal mental 
status.  Her doxepin was also continued as family stated that 
this helped her anxiety/confusion in the past.  She was sent out 
on the doses of these meds that she came in on.

5.h/o UTIs: Initial UA and Ucx were negative.

6.Renal: Creatinine at 1.1 on admit. Most recent value is from 
January, but is 0.6. We hydrated her gently and rechecked in the 
morning.  It had normalized to her baseline and stayed there the 
remainder of her stay. 

7.Left abdominal pain/Neuro:Pt was complaining of this on day of 
discharge. On review of records, this pain has been present for 
some time and is believed to be part of a central pain syndrome. 
 She has been seeing neurologists for this and has been trying 
different medication regimens.  We will send her on low dose 
oxycodone, and have her follow-up as an outpt with her 
neurologist.  Consider a pain consult at nursing home.

She was discharged after stable Hct and no bleeding x6 days.  
Her mental status had returned to [**Location 1966**] after 2 nights of 
delirium.  She was seen by PT and will need PT at nursing home 
to correct deconditioning.
In addition, she will make appointments to follow-up with her 
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], GI, and neuro to make sure she has all options 
available in the future and that she stays connected within the 
system should she require treatment in the future.  In addition, 
a small poylp was seen on colonoscopy, and can be followed by GI 
as an outpatient.  She was sent on 2 months of iron to replace 
iron stores lost by GI bleeding, as well as B12 and folate.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      85 year old woman with history of lower GI bleed, now admitted with recurrent 
      lower GI bleed. Tagged RBC scan positive for bleeding at hepatic flexure. Needs 
      angiogram +/- embolization.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Lower GI bleed. Needs angiogram +/- embolization.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 85 year-old woman with recent acute episode of lower
     gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding shown by nuclear scan in the region of the
     splenic flexure of the colon.
     
     COMPARISON: Comparison is made to previous mesenteric angiogram from [**12-25**], 2004, which had been performed for another bleeding in the region of hte
     hepatic flexure.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 43**] d'Othee and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
     [**Doctor Last Name 7261**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 43**] [**Name (STitle) 44**], the attending radiologist, was present during
     and supervising the entire procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The risk and benefits of the procedure were discussed
     with the patient and the daughter of the patient and informed consent was
     obtained from both. The procedure was performed under intravenous conscious
     sedations. Local anesthesia was obtained  with 1% Lidocaine. The patient was
     brought to the angiography table and placed in supine position. The right
     groin was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion. Fluoroscopy was
     performed to identify a proper position for the arterial puncture. Access was
     obtained in the right common femoral artery using a 19-gauge single wall
     puncture needle. A 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 223**] wire was advanced into the abdominal aorta.
     The puncture needle was removed and a 5-French angiographic sheath was then
     introduced over the wire. The inner dilator was removed and the sheath was
     hooked up to a heparinized saline drip.
     
     A 5-French, 65 cm long C2 Cobra Glidecatheter was then introduced through the
     sheath. The [**Last Name (un) 223**] wire was removed and an 0.035 Glidewire was introduced
     into the Cobra catheter. Using the combination of the Glidewire and catheter,
     we cannulated the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). The Glidewire was removed
     and an SMA arteriogram was performed in two different obliquities. No evidence
                                                                 (Over)

     of active extravasation was seen.
     
     The inferior mesenteric artery ([**Female First Name (un) **]) was then cannulated using the same
     technique and materials, and a selective [**Female First Name (un) **] arteriogram was then performed.
     Again, there was no active bleeding seen.
     
     It was decided to perform a superselective arteriogram of these vessels. A
     Renegade high-flow microcatheter was then introduced over its 0.018 wire and
     advanced successively into two different second-order, left colic branches of
     the [**Female First Name (un) **], close to the splenic flexure. Two successive superselective
     arteriograms were performed. Again, no evidence for active bleeding was seen.
     
     The catheters were removed. The angiographic sheath was removed and manual
     pressure was applied over the groin until hemostasis was achieved. The
     findings were discussed with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2015**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9690**], M.D., at the end of the
     procedure.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: There were no immediate complications. The patient remained
     hemodynamically stable during the entire procedure.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS: Total of 130 cc of Optiray 320 given intra-arterially.
     Intravenous conscious sedation was achieved with total amounts of 2 mg of
     Versed and 125 mcg of Fentanyl given in divided doses under continuous
     hemodynamic monitoring during the procedure. Lidocaine 1% SQ for local
     anesthesia.
     
     IMPRESSION: Superior and inferior mesenteric arteriograms showing no evidence
     of active arterial extravasation, in particular at the splenic flexure. No
     intervention was performed.

     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The risk and benefits of the procedure were discussed
     with the patient and the daughter of the patient and informed consent was
     obtained from both. The procedure was performed under intravenous conscious
     sedations. Local anesthesia was obtained  with 1% Lidocaine. The patient was
     brought to the angiography table and placed in supine position. The right
     groin was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion. Fluoroscopy was
     performed to identify a proper position for the arterial puncture. Access was

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      85 year old woman with history of lower GI bleed, now admitted with recurrent 
      lower GI bleed. Tagged RBC scan positive for bleeding at hepatic flexure. Needs 
      angiogram +/- embolization.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 85 year-old woman with recent acute episode of lower
     gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding shown by nuclear scan in the region of the
     splenic flexure of the colon.
     
     COMPARISON: Comparison is made to previous mesenteric angiogram from [**12-25**], 2004, which had been performed for another bleeding in the region of hte
     hepatic flexure.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 43**] d'Othee and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
     [**Doctor Last Name 7261**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 43**] [**Name (STitle) 44**], the attending radiologist, was present during
     and supervising the entire procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The risk and benefits of the procedure were discussed
     with the patient and the daughter of the patient and informed consent was
     obtained from both. The procedure was performed under intravenous conscious
     sedations. Local anesthesia was obtained  with 1% Lidocaine. The patient was
     brought to the angiography table and placed in supine position. The right
     groin was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion. Fluoroscopy was
     performed to identify a proper position for the arterial puncture. Access was
     obtained in the right common femoral artery using a 19-gauge single wall
     puncture needle. A 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 223**] wire was advanced into the abdominal aorta.
     The puncture needle was removed and a 5-French angiographic sheath was then
     introduced over the wire. The inner dilator was removed and the sheath was
     hooked up to a heparinized saline drip.
     
     A 5-French, 65 cm long C2 Cobra Glidecatheter was then introduced through the
     sheath. The [**Last Name (un) 223**] wire was removed and an 0.035 Glidewire was introduced
     into the Cobra catheter. Using the combination of the Glidewire and catheter,
     we cannulated the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). The Glidewire was removed
     and an SMA arteriogram was performed in two different obliquities. No evidence

     The inferior mesenteric artery ([**Female First Name (un) **]) was then cannulated using the same
     technique and materials, and a selective [**Female First Name (un) **] arteriogram was then performed.
     Again, there was no active bleeding seen.
     
     It was decided to perform a superselective arteriogram of these vessels. A
     Renegade high-flow microcatheter was then introduced over its 0.018 wire and
     advanced successively into two different second-order, left colic branches of
     the [**Female First Name (un) **], close to the splenic flexure. Two successive superselective
     arteriograms were performed. Again, no evidence for active bleeding was seen.
     
     The catheters were removed. The angiographic sheath was removed and manual
     pressure was applied over the groin until hemostasis was achieved. The
     findings were discussed with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2015**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9690**], M.D., at the end of the
     procedure.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: There were no immediate complications. The patient remained
     hemodynamically stable during the entire procedure.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS: Total of 130 cc of Optiray 320 given intra-arterially.
     Intravenous conscious sedation was achieved with total amounts of 2 mg of
     Versed and 125 mcg of Fentanyl given in divided doses under continuous
     hemodynamic monitoring during the procedure. Lidocaine 1% SQ for local
     anesthesia.
     
     IMPRESSION: Superior and inferior mesenteric arteriograms showing no evidence
     of active arterial extravasation, in particular at the splenic flexure. No
     intervention was performed.

     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The risk and benefits of the procedure were discussed
     with the patient and the daughter of the patient and informed consent was
     obtained from both. The procedure was performed under intravenous conscious
     sedations. Local anesthesia was obtained  with 1% Lidocaine. The patient was
     brought to the angiography table and placed in supine position. The right
     groin was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion. Fluoroscopy was
     performed to identify a proper position for the arterial puncture. Access was
     obtained in the right common femoral artery using a 19-gauge single wall
     puncture needle. A 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 223**] wire was advanced into the abdominal aorta.
     The puncture needle was removed and a 5-French angiographic sheath was then
     introduced over the wire. The inner dilator was removed and the sheath was
     hooked up to a heparinized saline drip.
     
     A 5-French, 65 cm long C2 Cobra Glidecatheter was then introduced through the
     sheath. The [**Last Name (un) 223**] wire was removed and an 0.035 Glidewire was introduced
     into the Cobra catheter. Using the combination of the Glidewire and catheter,
     we cannulated the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). The Glidewire was removed

     INDICATION:  An 85-year-old female with history of lower GI bleed, now
     admitted with acute lower GI bleed, positive tagged RBC scan for bleeding at
     hepatic flexure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3349**] [**Name (STitle) 3350**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6**], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6**], the attending radiologist, present and supervising.
     After explaining the risks and benefits of the procedure to the patient,
     written informed consent was obtained.  The patient was placed supine on the
     angiography table, and the right groin was prepped and draped in standard
     sterile fashion.  After local administration of 1% Lidocaine, the right common
     femoral artery was accessed using a 19-gauge single-wall puncture needle under
     fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was exchanged for a 5-French sheath over an
     035 guide wire under fluoroscopic guidance.  A 5-French SOS Omni catheter was
     advanced under fluoroscopic guidance over the [**Last Name (un) 9292**] wire, and engaged in the
     superior mesenteric artery, and a superior mesenteric arteriogram was
     performed.  A small area of contrast extravasation was seen in the region of
     the hepatic flexure.  The Omni SOS catheter was advanced further into the
     superior mesenteric artery.  A Renegade microcatheter was then advanced
     through the Omni SOS catheter adjacent to the area of bleeding.  Additional
     angiograms were performed to confirm the area of bleeding.  Three 3 mm x 1 cm
     coils were then placed just proximal to the area of bleeding.  Another
     angiographic run was performed which demonstrated cessation of bleeding at the
     site visualized earlier, however, another small site of contrast extravasation
     was seen inferior to the one seen earlier.  It was decided to embolize the
     site with coils.  A 4 mm x 2 cm coil was advanced through the Renegade
     microcatheter, however, appeared to get lodged within the catheter.  The
     Renegade microcatheter was then exchanged for a Tracker microcatheter, which

     HISTORY:  Hematochezia. 
      
     INTERPRETATION:  Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells 
     labeled with Tc-99m, blood flow and delayed images of the abdomen for 35 minutes
     were obtained. 
      
     Blood flow images show a focus of increased tracer activity in the right upper 
     quadrant which does not washout. 
      
     Delayed blood pool images demonstrate tracer migrating within the bowel lumen
     beginning in the region of the hepatic flexure.  Note that at 15 minutes, the
     patient has a bowel movement at which point the tracer activity cleared.  On
     subsequent imaging begun immediately after, again tracer activity is noted
     within bowel lumen beginning in the region of the hepatic flexure.  
        
     IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with a brisk GI bleed apparently located in the
     hepatic flexure at the colon.  The patient was subsequently transferred to
     interventional radiology for therapy.

     INDICATIONS:  Status post mesenteric embolization with decreased mental
     status.  Evaluate for intracranial hemorrhage or ischemia.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT.
     
     COMPARISON:  Brain MRI from [**2578-12-20**].
     
     NONCONTRAST HEAD CT:  There is a remote infarct involving the right
     temporal/parietal/occipital and inferoright frontal region,which has evolved
     since the prior brain MRI.  This area has undergone encephalomalacic change in
     the interval.  There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage or hydrocephalus.
     Minor small vessel ischemic changes are present throughout both cerebral
     hemispheres, and there is mild brain atrophy.  Note is made of apparent
     increased attenuation in the brain stem but this is due to beam hardening
     artifact from the floor of the middle cranial fossa.  [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter
     differentiation remains preserved elsewhere in the brain.  There is no acute
     skull fracture.  The visualized sinuses are clear.  Note is made of juvenile
     pneumatization of the mastoid air cells.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Changes from remote right MCA infarction.  No acute stroke or
     acute intracranial hemorrhage.
     
     
     
     NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is expansion and ""ground glass""
     appearance of the sphenoid wings bilaterally.  This may represent fibrous
     dysplasia. The configuration of the sphenoid wings has not changed since the
     MR of [**2578-12-20**].

     INDICATION:  An 85-year-old female with history of lower GI bleed, now
     admitted with acute lower GI bleed, positive tagged RBC scan for bleeding at
     hepatic flexure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3349**] [**Name (STitle) 3350**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6**], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6**], the attending radiologist, present and supervising.
     After explaining the risks and benefits of the procedure to the patient,
     written informed consent was obtained.  The patient was placed supine on the
     angiography table, and the right groin was prepped and draped in standard
     sterile fashion.  After local administration of 1% Lidocaine, the right common
     femoral artery was accessed using a 19-gauge single-wall puncture needle under
     fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was exchanged for a 5-French sheath over an
     035 guide wire under fluoroscopic guidance.  A 5-French SOS Omni catheter was
     advanced under fluoroscopic guidance over the [**Last Name (un) 9292**] wire, and engaged in the
     superior mesenteric artery, and a superior mesenteric arteriogram was
     performed.  A small area of contrast extravasation was seen in the region of
     the hepatic flexure.  The Omni SOS catheter was advanced further into the
     superior mesenteric artery.  A Renegade microcatheter was then advanced
     through the Omni SOS catheter adjacent to the area of bleeding.  Additional
     angiograms were performed to confirm the area of bleeding.  Three 3 mm x 1 cm
     coils were then placed just proximal to the area of bleeding.  Another
     angiographic run was performed which demonstrated cessation of bleeding at the
     site visualized earlier, however, another small site of contrast extravasation
     was seen inferior to the one seen earlier.  It was decided to embolize the
     site with coils.  A 4 mm x 2 cm coil was advanced through the Renegade
     microcatheter, however, appeared to get lodged within the catheter.  The
     Renegade microcatheter was then exchanged for a Tracker microcatheter, which
                                                                 (Over)

     was again advanced selectively adjacent to the area of bleeding.  Two 2 cm x 4
     mm coils were placed proximal to the second area of bleeding.  An SMA
     angiogram performed demonstrated no further areas of contrast extravasation.
     Subsequently, celiac and inferior mesenteric angiograms were performed which
     demonstrated a normal anatomy, with no areas of active bleeding.  The SOS Omni
     and Tracker catheters were removed.  The patient was transferred to the
     recovery area where the right groin sheath was removed and manual pressure
     applied until hemostasis was achieved.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Two sites of bleeding (2 segmental branches of the right colic artery)
     seen in the region of the right hepatic flexure which were embolized with
     coils, with no further bleeding.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      85F with history of lower GI bleed, now admitted with recurrent  lower GI 
      bleed. Tagged RBC scan positive for bleeding at hepatic flexure. Needs  
      angiogram +/- embolization.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      mesenteric angio with embolization if possible

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  An 85-year-old female with history of lower GI bleed, now
     admitted with acute lower GI bleed, positive tagged RBC scan for bleeding at
     hepatic flexure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3349**] [**Name (STitle) 3350**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6**], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6**], the attending radiologist, present and supervising.
     After explaining the risks and benefits of the procedure to the patient,
     written informed consent was obtained.  The patient was placed supine on the
     angiography table, and the right groin was prepped and draped in standard
     sterile fashion.  After local administration of 1% Lidocaine, the right common
     femoral artery was accessed using a 19-gauge single-wall puncture needle under
     fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was exchanged for a 5-French sheath over an
     035 guide wire under fluoroscopic guidance.  A 5-French SOS Omni catheter was
     advanced under fluoroscopic guidance over the [**Last Name (un) 9292**] wire, and engaged in the
     superior mesenteric artery, and a superior mesenteric arteriogram was
     performed.  A small area of contrast extravasation was seen in the region of
     the hepatic flexure.  The Omni SOS catheter was advanced further into the
     superior mesenteric artery.  A Renegade microcatheter was then advanced
     through the Omni SOS catheter adjacent to the area of bleeding.  Additional
     angiograms were performed to confirm the area of bleeding.  Three 3 mm x 1 cm
     coils were then placed just proximal to the area of bleeding.  Another
     angiographic run was performed which demonstrated cessation of bleeding at the
     site visualized earlier, however, another small site of contrast extravasation
     was seen inferior to the one seen earlier.  It was decided to embolize the
     site with coils.  A 4 mm x 2 cm coil was advanced through the Renegade
     microcatheter, however, appeared to get lodged within the catheter.  The
     Renegade microcatheter was then exchanged for a Tracker microcatheter, which
                                                                 (Over)

     was again advanced selectively adjacent to the area of bleeding.  Two 2 cm x 4
     mm coils were placed proximal to the second area of bleeding.  An SMA
     angiogram performed demonstrated no further areas of contrast extravasation.
     Subsequently, celiac and inferior mesenteric angiograms were performed which
     demonstrated a normal anatomy, with no areas of active bleeding.  The SOS Omni
     and Tracker catheters were removed.  The patient was transferred to the
     recovery area where the right groin sheath was removed and manual pressure
     applied until hemostasis was achieved.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Two sites of bleeding (2 segmental branches of the right colic artery)
     seen in the region of the right hepatic flexure which were embolized with
     coils, with no further bleeding.
     2.  Celiac and inferior mesenteric injections demonstrated no areas of active
     bleeding.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      85F with history of lower GI bleed, now admitted with recurrent  lower GI 
      bleed. Tagged RBC scan positive for bleeding at hepatic flexure. Needs  
      angiogram +/- embolization.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      mesenteric angio with embolization if possible                                  
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  An 85-year-old female with history of lower GI bleed, now
     admitted with acute lower GI bleed, positive tagged RBC scan for bleeding at
     hepatic flexure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3349**] [**Name (STitle) 3350**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6**], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6**], the attending radiologist, present and supervising.
     After explaining the risks and benefits of the procedure to the patient,
     written informed consent was obtained.  The patient was placed supine on the
     angiography table, and the right groin was prepped and draped in standard
     sterile fashion.  After local administration of 1% Lidocaine, the right common
     femoral artery was accessed using a 19-gauge single-wall puncture needle under
     fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was exchanged for a 5-French sheath over an
     035 guide wire under fluoroscopic guidance.  A 5-French SOS Omni catheter was
     advanced under fluoroscopic guidance over the [**Last Name (un) 9292**] wire, and engaged in the
     superior mesenteric artery, and a superior mesenteric arteriogram was
     performed.  A small area of contrast extravasation was seen in the region of
     the hepatic flexure.  The Omni SOS catheter was advanced further into the
     superior mesenteric artery.  A Renegade microcatheter was then advanced
     through the Omni SOS catheter adjacent to the area of bleeding.  Additional
     angiograms were performed to confirm the area of bleeding.  Three 3 mm x 1 cm
     coils were then placed just proximal to the area of bleeding.  Another
     angiographic run was performed which demonstrated cessation of bleeding at the
     site visualized earlier, however, another small site of contrast extravasation
     was seen inferior to the one seen earlier.  It was decided to embolize the
     site with coils.  A 4 mm x 2 cm coil was advanced through the Renegade
     microcatheter, however, appeared to get lodged within the catheter.  The
     Renegade microcatheter was then exchanged for a Tracker microcatheter, which
                                                                 (Over)

     was again advanced selectively adjacent to the area of bleeding.  Two 2 cm x 4
     mm coils were placed proximal to the second area of bleeding.  An SMA
     angiogram performed demonstrated no further areas of contrast extravasation.
     Subsequently, celiac and inferior mesenteric angiograms were performed which
     demonstrated a normal anatomy, with no areas of active bleeding.  The SOS Omni
     and Tracker catheters were removed.  The patient was transferred to the
     recovery area where the right groin sheath was removed and manual pressure
     applied until hemostasis was achieved.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Two sites of bleeding (2 segmental branches of the right colic artery)
     seen in the region of the right hepatic flexure which were embolized with
     coils, with no further bleeding.
     2.  Celiac and inferior mesenteric injections demonstrated no areas of active
     bleeding.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      85F with history of lower GI bleed, now admitted with recurrent  lower GI 
      bleed. Tagged RBC scan positive for bleeding at hepatic flexure. Needs  
      angiogram +/- embolization.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      mesenteric angio with embolization if possible

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  An 85-year-old female with history of lower GI bleed, now
     admitted with acute lower GI bleed, positive tagged RBC scan for bleeding at
     hepatic flexure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3349**] [**Name (STitle) 3350**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6**], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6**], the attending radiologist, present and supervising.
     After explaining the risks and benefits of the procedure to the patient,
     written informed consent was obtained.  The patient was placed supine on the
     angiography table, and the right groin was prepped and draped in standard
     sterile fashion.  After local administration of 1% Lidocaine, the right common
     femoral artery was accessed using a 19-gauge single-wall puncture needle under
     fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was exchanged for a 5-French sheath over an
     035 guide wire under fluoroscopic guidance.  A 5-French SOS Omni catheter was
     advanced under fluoroscopic guidance over the [**Last Name (un) 9292**] wire, and engaged in the
     superior mesenteric artery, and a superior mesenteric arteriogram was
     performed.  A small area of contrast extravasation was seen in the region of
     the hepatic flexure.  The Omni SOS catheter was advanced further into the
     superior mesenteric artery.  A Renegade microcatheter was then advanced
     through the Omni SOS catheter adjacent to the area of bleeding.  Additional
     angiograms were performed to confirm the area of bleeding.  Three 3 mm x 1 cm
     coils were then placed just proximal to the area of bleeding.  Another
     angiographic run was performed which demonstrated cessation of bleeding at the
     site visualized earlier, however, another small site of contrast extravasation
     was seen inferior to the one seen earlier.  It was decided to embolize the
     site with coils.  A 4 mm x 2 cm coil was advanced through the Renegade
     microcatheter, however, appeared to get lodged within the catheter.  The
     Renegade microcatheter was then exchanged for a Tracker microcatheter, which
                                                                 (Over)

     was again advanced selectively adjacent to the area of bleeding.  Two 2 cm x 4
     mm coils were placed proximal to the second area of bleeding.  An SMA
     angiogram performed demonstrated no further areas of contrast extravasation.
     Subsequently, celiac and inferior mesenteric angiograms were performed which
     demonstrated a normal anatomy, with no areas of active bleeding.  The SOS Omni
     and Tracker catheters were removed.  The patient was transferred to the
     recovery area where the right groin sheath was removed and manual pressure
     applied until hemostasis was achieved.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Two sites of bleeding (2 segmental branches of the right colic artery)
     seen in the region of the right hepatic flexure which were embolized with
     coils, with no further bleeding.
     2.  Celiac and inferior mesenteric injections demonstrated no areas of active
     bleeding.

     and Tracker catheters were removed.  The patient was transferred to the
     recovery area where the right groin sheath was removed and manual pressure
     applied until hemostasis was achieved.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Two sites of bleeding (2 segmental branches of the right colic artery)
     seen in the region of the right hepatic flexure which were embolized with
     coils, with no further bleeding.
     2.  Celiac and inferior mesenteric injections demonstrated no areas of active
     bleeding.

     INDICATION:  Right-sided abdominal pain and elevated white blood cell count.
     Recent bleeding S/P coiling.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector contrast enhanced images of the abdomen and pelvis
     following the rapid bolus administration of 100 cc of IV Optiray were
     performed.  Images were reconstructed in the sagittal and coronal planes.
     
     IV CONTRAST:  Non-ionic IV Optiray contrast was used for rapid bolus
     administration.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  Minor atelectasis is seen at the lung bases.
      The patient is S/P cholecystectomy.  Mild intrahepatic biliary ductal
     dilatation is likely related to this.  The spleen, pancreas, stomach, and
     small bowel are unremarkable.  Both kidneys enhance and excrete contrast
     promptly and symmetrically.  Areas of cortical atrophy involving the right
     kidney mid-pole are likely related to old scarring from infection or
     infarction.  Atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta and its branches,
     with areas of a mural plaque formation is noted.  The patient is S/P coiling
     of branches of her right colic artery.  The mid-ascending colon and hepatic
     flexure demonstrate bowel wall thickening and adjacent hazy fat stranding
     within the mesentery.  Diverticulosis of the entire large bowel is noted.
     There is no pneumatosis, portal venous gas, or free air.  There are no focal
     fluid collections.  Note is made of a small hiatal hernia. 
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The bladder is unremarkable.  It contains a
     Foley catheter. There is no free fluid.  There is marked sigmoid
     diverticulosis without diverticulitis. The uterus and adnexa are unremarkable.
      No free fluid.  Small collection/hematoma and stranding are noted in the
     right groin form recent intervention.
     
     Bone windows show no suspicious lesions.

     ABDOMEN, 2 VIEWS:
     
     History of lower abdominal pain and rectal bleeding.
     
     There are a few gas-filled loops of slightly dilated small bowel with small
     air fluid levels with gas present in the colon.  Surgical clips are present in
     the right upper quadrant and surgical staples in a left paramedian location.
     Previously noted gaseous distention of small bowel is no longer present.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Findings are consistent with post-op ileus, probably improved
     since the prior study of [**2579-12-16**].  Correlate clinically and with
     further follow up if indicated.
