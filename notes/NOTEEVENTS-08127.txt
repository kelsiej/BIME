Admission Date:  [**2898-10-26**]     Discharge Date:  [**2898-11-2**]

Date of Birth:   [**2839-1-22**]     Sex:  F

Service:  O-MED

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60-year-old
female with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder,
status post excision, status post chemotherapy and radiation
following local recurrence, who presented to [**Hospital1 74**] after a 3-week hospitalization in
[**Location (un) 11216**], [**State 1356**] where she was with mental status changes
and renal failure.  As per the patient's husband, the patient
presented to urologist in [**State 1356**] about one month ago with
symptoms suggestive of a urinary tract infection with nausea,
and vomiting, fevers, and dark urine.

On [**9-29**] she had an ultrasound that was consistent
with bilateral hydronephrosis and ureteral obstruction.  On
[**9-30**] the patient was admitted to Indian River
[**Hospital **] Hospital in [**Location (un) 11216**], [**State 1356**] with decreased
functional status, fatigue, nausea, low-grade fevers, and
decreased colostomy output.  The patient was found to have
evidence of colonic stool impaction and ileus and bilateral
hydronephrosis with a urinary tract infection.  The ileus was
presumed to be secondary to urosepsis.  Initially the patient
was treated with mineral oil and started on total parenteral
nutrition.  She was transfused packed red blood cells and
treated with antibiotics.  On [**10-1**] the patient became
increasingly disoriented, incoherent, and decreasing
responsive.  She had a magnetic resonance imaging of the head
that was negative for metastatic disease.  She had a CT of
the abdomen on [**10-1**] which showed dilated bowel loops
suggestive of obstruction with bilateral ectasia of renal
collecting septum.  She had a repeat abdominal CT on

[**2898-10-22**] with new 5-cm soft tissue density in the
right pelvis with a question of abscess versus hematoma
versus neoplasm.  On [**10-23**] a tagged red blood cell scan
was negative for localization to right upper quadrant and
right lower quadrant.  As per the husband, the medical team
planned a biopsy of the soft tissue density, but the husband
decided to drive his wife back to [**Location (un) 210**] for her care.  He
does note her mental status has been poor for the last two to
three weeks but has had some days that are better than
others.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Squamous cell bladder carcinoma diagnosed on [**2898-2-19**]; stage IV with invasion into the paravaginal regional
and left vaginal wall.  She is status post cystectomy and
lymph node dissection with ileal loop diversion and pelvic
exoneration.  The patient had local recurrence in [**2898-1-20**] and was treated with cisplatin and radiation.  She is
status post anterior exenteration with ileal conduit.  She is
also status post rectovaginal fistula secondary to radiation
therapy, status post surgery.
2.  Multiple sclerosis diagnosed in [**2864**].
3.  History of urinary tract infections, positive for
pseudomonas.
4.  History of sacral decubitus ulcer.
5.  History of recurrent infection of ureteral drainage.
6.  History of mitral valve prolapse.
7.  History of chronic vaginal discharge.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications per husband were
atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d., Zoloft 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
Baclofen 10 mg p.o. b.i.d., diazepam 10 mg p.o. q.d.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Medications on transfer from the
outside hospital were Protonix, OxyContin, Compazine, and
Percocet.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married.  Lives part-time in
[**Location (un) 11216**] and part-time in [**State **].  Denies alcohol or
tobacco.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On admission
temperature 99.4, pulse 88, blood pressure 116/67, oxygen
saturation 96% on room air.  The patient was awake,
responsive to some commands, had difficulty articulating her
responses, in no acute distress.  Head, ears, nose, eyes and
throat revealed dry mucous membranes.  No erythema or
exudate.  Neck was supple.  No jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular was rapid, regular, a 2/6 systolic ejection
murmur at the left upper sternal border radiating to the
axilla.  Lungs had decreased breath sounds at the bases
bilaterally with poor air movement, but no wheezes or
crackles.  Abdomen was tense, distended, question of right
lower quadrant mass, positive bowel sounds, negative rebound
or guarding.  Left colostomy with clear yellow urine, right
colostomy was empty.  Negative costovertebral angle
tenderness.  Extremities were flexed, contracted lower
extremities, trace pedal edema, and 2+ pedal pulses.  Back
revealed sacral decubitus ulcer with wide base. No obvious
tracking or extension, packed with gauze.  Neurologically,
pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  The patient failed to follow commands,
grasped hands, and followed some commands.  No focal weakness
was appreciated.

LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On admission white blood
cell count of 26.2, hematocrit 34, platelets 248;
93% neutrophils, 4% lymphocytes, 2% monocytes.
Potassium 6.2, sodium 134, chloride 98, bicarbonate 23, blood
urea nitrogen 113, creatinine 3.5, glucose 80.  Calcium 11
(corrected to 12.2), albumin 2.5, magnesium 1.9,
phosphorous 5.7.  INR of 1.4.  Urinalysis with 22 red blood
cells, no epithelial cells, small blood.  Cultures were
pending.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram with a rate of 75,
regular rhythm, normal axis, no P-T, and no acute ST-T wave
changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient with an elevated white
count and low-grade fever suggestive of acute infectious
process, likely urinary tract infection or pyelonephritis.
The patient was started on Zosyn.  Later in her course when
she decompensated levofloxacin, Flagyl, and one dose of
vancomycin were added.  This was for presumed
hospital-acquired pneumonia that led to some respiratory
failure.

2.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  The patient with a high
calcium likely secondary to renal failure and/or metastatic
disease.  The patient was treated with fluids, Lasix, and
pamidronate.  Also with hyperkalemia treated with Kayexalate
and insulin.  These eventually normalized.

3.  RENAL:  The patient with acute-on-chronic renal
insufficiency.  The patient with known bladder cancer.  She
had a right pelvic mass that was re-evaluated on magnetic
resonance imaging that was thought to be recurrence of tumor.
She had a left percutaneous nephrostomy tube placed during
her hospital course.  She also had a bone scan that showed no
metastatic disease to her bones.

4.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient with initially elevated INR and
given vitamin K.

5.  RESPIRATORY:  The patient had respiratory decompensation
on [**2898-10-30**], with desaturations into the 80s on 100%
nonrebreather.  During that time the patient was tachycardic
up to the 200s and with elevated blood pressure.

The patient required intubation and was transferred to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit.  She was in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for two days where she was stabilized and
additional antibiotic coverage was added.  She was extubated
successfully and transferred back to the floor with a comfort
measures only status.

The patient expired on [**2898-11-2**] at 7:50 p.m. with
respiratory failure.

     INDICATION: Left-sided percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement from [**2898-10-28**].
     The patient is a 59-year-old woman with bladder cancer status post ileal loop
     with bilateral hydronephrosis and outside study demonstrating severe stenosis
     of the left ureteroileal anastomosis.  Also, increasing creatinine.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 398**] [**Name (STitle) 399**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 5061**] [**Name (STitle) 2109**], and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 338**] [**Name (STitle) 339**].  Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 339**], the staff radiologist, was present and supervised the procedure.
     Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 400**] reviewed the case.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Informed written consent was obtained from the patient's husband.
     Left renal ultrasonography was performed, which demonstrated dilated renal
     collecting system. A spot was marked for percutaneous access.  The skin was
     prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  One percent lidocaine was used for
     local anesthesia. Under real-time sonographic guidance, an AccuStick needle
     was advanced into a posterior calyx at the level midpole of the kidney. A few
     mL of clear urine was sent for microbiology.  The AccuStick guide wire was
     advanced into the renal collecting system under direct fluoroscopic
     visualization. The needle was removed and the tract was dilated with a 4.5
     French dilator. The AccuStick wire was removed and an antegrade percutaneous
     nephrostogram was performed through the dilator. The table was positioned into
     slight reverse Trendelenburg in order to opacify the dilated distal portion of
     the ureter. A 0.035 guide wire was advanced into the proximal ureter. The 4.5
     French dilator was exchanged for a #7 French dilator. The #7 French dilator
     was removed and a #8 French pigtail catheter was placed and the pigtail was
     formed within the renal pelvis.  A repeat antegrade tube nephrostogram was
     then performed.
     
     MEDICATIONS: 1 mg of Versed IV and 50 mcg of Fentanyl IV were administered in
     divided doses with continuous hemodynamic monitoring.
     
     CONTRAST: 15 cc of Optiray 30%.  Optiray was chosen due to patient's declining
     renal function.

     FINDINGS: Nephrostogram demonstrates moderately dilated left renal collecting
     system and left ureter with obstruction at the apparent location of the
     ureteroileal anastomosis in the region of numerous surgical clips.  Initial
     nephrostogram demonstrated lack of opacification of the mid to distal ureter,
     which was shown to incompletely opacify on subsequent nephrostograms through
     the nephrostomy tube.  No contrast was seen to flow into the ileal loop, even
     with reverse Trendelenburg position.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful placement of #8 French pigtail nephrostomy tube on the
     left.  Dilated left renal collecting and left ureter up to the ureteroileal
     anastomosis, which appears obstructed.  No contrast was seen to flow into the
     ileal loop from the left. No complications to the procedure.

     FINDINGS: Nephrostogram demonstrates moderately dilated left renal collecting
     system and left ureter with obstruction at the apparent location of the
     ureteroileal anastomosis in the region of numerous surgical clips.  Initial
     nephrostogram demonstrated lack of opacification of the mid to distal ureter,
     which was shown to incompletely opacify on subsequent nephrostograms through
     the nephrostomy tube.  No contrast was seen to flow into the ileal loop, even
     with reverse Trendelenburg position.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      59 year old woman with recurrent squamous cell ca, now with acute renal failure
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      pt has h/o recurrent squamous cell ca who was seen on imaging at OSH to have
      90% narrowing of left ureter. Seen by urology team today who recommend
      placement of left percutaneous nephrostomy tube ASAP as pt creatinine is
      rising, now 4.0
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Left-sided percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement from [**2898-10-28**].
     The patient is a 59-year-old woman with bladder cancer status post ileal loop
     with bilateral hydronephrosis and outside study demonstrating severe stenosis
     of the left ureteroileal anastomosis.  Also, increasing creatinine.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 398**] [**Name (STitle) 399**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 5061**] [**Name (STitle) 2109**], and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 338**] [**Name (STitle) 339**].  Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 339**], the staff radiologist, was present and supervised the procedure.
     Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 400**] reviewed the case.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Informed written consent was obtained from the patient's husband.
     Left renal ultrasonography was performed, which demonstrated dilated renal
     collecting system. A spot was marked for percutaneous access.  The skin was
     prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  One percent lidocaine was used for
     local anesthesia. Under real-time sonographic guidance, an AccuStick needle
     was advanced into a posterior calyx at the level midpole of the kidney. A few
     mL of clear urine was sent for microbiology.  The AccuStick guide wire was
     advanced into the renal collecting system under direct fluoroscopic
     visualization. The needle was removed and the tract was dilated with a 4.5
     French dilator. The AccuStick wire was removed and an antegrade percutaneous
     nephrostogram was performed through the dilator. The table was positioned into
     slight reverse Trendelenburg in order to opacify the dilated distal portion of
     the ureter. A 0.035 guide wire was advanced into the proximal ureter. The 4.5
     French dilator was exchanged for a #7 French dilator. The #7 French dilator
     was removed and a #8 French pigtail catheter was placed and the pigtail was
     formed within the renal pelvis.  A repeat antegrade tube nephrostogram was
     then performed.
     
     MEDICATIONS: 1 mg of Versed IV and 50 mcg of Fentanyl IV were administered in
     divided doses with continuous hemodynamic monitoring.
     
     CONTRAST: 15 cc of Optiray 30%.  Optiray was chosen due to patient's declining
     renal function.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Patient with previous history of bladder cancer. Outside
     hospital CT shows a mass in the right hemipelvis.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MR imaging of the pelvis was performed at 1.5 Tesla
     using the following sequences:  axial and sagittal T2, axial T1 in and out of
     phase, coronal HASTE, T2 coronal thick slab, and pre- and post-gadolinium
     administration 3D VIBE sequence.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is a large mass in the right hemipelvis.  This mass measures
     approximately 7 x 6 x 7 cm (AP x lateral lateral x craniocaudal) in size.  The
     mass is just medial to the right iliac muscle.  Another component is
     demonstrated in the posterior right hemipelvis measuring approximately 6 x 7 x
     5.5 cm (AP x lateral lateral x craniocaudal) in size.  This mass appears to be
     an extension from the mass in the right anterior hemipelvis.  The posterior
     component of the mass is growing and extending into the right sacrum and is
     involving the foramen for the S1 nerve root.  After gadolinium administration,
     the mass demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement with central areas of poor
     enhancement consistent with necrosis.
     
     The described mass is encasing the right iliac vessels.  There is a filling
     defect in the right iliac vein and right common femoral vein consistent with
     thrombosis.  This thrombus is extending from the level of the bifurcation to
     the level of the femoral head.  The proximal right lower extremity was not
     evaluated in this study.
     
     There is diffuse wall thickening in several loops of small bowel as well as
     the sigmoid colon probably related to the previous history of radiotherapy.
     
     A colostomy is noted in the left lower quadrant.  An ileostomy is also
     demonstrated in the left lower quadrant.
     
     The anterior component of the described mass is compressing the loop of small
     bowel at the level of the ileostomy as well as the distal ureters.  There is
     significant right-sided hydronephrosis.  The left kidney is not
     hydronephrotic.  Multiple surgical clips are demonstrated at both sides of the
     pelvis.  Another susceptibility artifact is noted on the left side in the
     region of the lower pelvis consistent with a local radiotherapy implant.
     
     In conclusion there is a large mass in the right hemipelvis encasing the
     distal ileostomy and distal ureters.  The mass is also involving the right
                                                                 (Over)

     HISTORY:  Fifty-nine year old female with recurrent squamous cell bladder cancer
     presents with new pelvic mass.  Evaluate for progression of metastatic disease.
      
     INTERPRETATION:  Whole body views of the skeleton show no foci of abnormally  
     increased tracer activity within the osseous structures.  
      
     The above described findings are consistent with absence of metastatic disease.
      
     When compared to the previous study of [**2898-6-26**], the present study shows no
     significant change.
      
     The right kidney and urinary diversion are visualized, s/p surgical
     intervention. The left kidney is not visualized.
