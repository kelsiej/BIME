Admission Date:  [**2706-4-6**]     Discharge Date:  [**2706-4-26**]

Date of Birth:   [**2622-1-20**]     Sex:  M

Service:  MICU

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Hypoxic respiratory failure.
2.  Pneumonia.
3.  Adult respiratory distress syndrome.
4.  Hypotension.
5.  Atrial fibrillation.
6.  Anemia.
7.  Tension pneumothorax.
8.  Adrenal insufficiency.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84-year-old male with
a past medical history significant for paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation and prostate cancer who was transferred from the
[**Hospital3 **] for further treatment of hypoxic respiratory
failure.  The patient was admitted to the an outside hospital
on [**2706-3-30**] with complaints of increased dyspnea
times one to two weeks with diaphoresis and chest pain with
cough and no fevers or chills.  The patient's dyspnea
progressed to shortness of breath while at rest.  The
patient's family noted that two other family members were
also suffering from shortness of breath and cough, both were
hospitalized with pneumonia.

On admission, the patient was originally started on
Ceftriaxone.  Chest x-ray revealed small right lower lobe and
left lower lobe infiltrates.  The patient was afebrile with a
white blood cell count of 12.8, a blood pressure of 86/40
with a heart rate of 130, 97% 02 saturation on four liters.
The patient's oxygen requirement continued to worsen with
increase opacifications on chest x-ray.  Levofloxacin was
substituted and steroids were added on [**4-4**].  The
patient was intubated on [**4-6**] for hypoxic respiratory
failure.  A CT scan was obtained revealing diffuse ground
glass opacities with extensive  emphysematous changes without
lymphadenopathy or tumor seen.  The patient was transferred
after intubation on assist control ventilation 750/14 with
pressure support of 7, PEEP of 5 and 100% FIO2.  In addition,
the patient was reported to have had an episode of atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response requiring
diltiazem drip but the patient spontaneously cardioverted to
sinus rhythm and arrived to the [**Hospital6 402**] without a diltiazem drip.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Prostate cancer, status post XRT in [**2695**].
2.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

DRUGS ON TRANSFER:  Levofloxacin 500 mg q.d., Solu-Medrol 60
mg intravenous q. 8 hours, digoxin 0.125 mg q.d., Zantac,
aspirin 325 mg po q.d., metoprolol 75 mg po b.i.d., heparin
5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  None.

A Gram stain sputum from [**4-3**]:  Moderate epithelial
cells, moderate gram positive rods, moderate gram positive
cocci, moderate pleomorphic gram negative rods.  Culture
sputum normal flora.  Blood culture from [**2706-3-30**]:

emphysematous changes bilaterally diffusely with occasional
large bulla, diffuse ground glass appearance.  Chest x-ray on
[**4-6**]:  Diffuse opacities bilaterally without
pneumothorax and normal heart size.

COURSE IN THE HOSPITAL:  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital6 293**] Intensive Care Unit on a
ventilator for treatment of pneumonia and presumed adult
respiratory distress syndrome.

1.  Respiratory for hypoxic respiratory failure.  The patient
was continued on mechanical ventilation with low tidal
volumes and pressures with PEEP for presumed adult
respiratory distress syndrome.  He was treated with albuterol
and Atrovent MDIs as necessary.  A bronchoscopy was performed
which revealed nonspecific changes.  The patient's ventilator
settings were adjusted as necessary to maintain stable oxygen
saturations and minimize pressures.  Despite multiple
attempts to decrease the patient's sedation and attempt to
wean the patient from the ventilator, the patient was unable
to be weaned from the ventilator as of [**2706-4-26**].

2.  Infectious Disease:  For the patient's pneumonia, he was
begun on Ceftriaxone and vancomycin initially.  This was then
changed to Levaquin.  Multiple cultures were sent including a
bronchoscopy sample which was negative for pneumocystis and
legionella and positive for [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.  Multiple blood
cultures and sputum cultures were negative.  The patient was
continued on Levaquin as described above.  On [**2706-4-15**],
the patient was hypotensive and hypothermic and was felt to
be septic and a question of vent acquired pneumonia was
raised.  The patient was then resumed on vancomycin and
Ceftriaxone for presumed vent acquired pneumonia.  The
patient continued to have temperatures and despite multiple
cultures and changing of access lines, the patient's cultures
remained negative.  Antibiotics were continued.

3.  Cardiovascular:  Hypotension:  The patient's hemodynamics
were aggressively monitored.  He was given intravenous fluids
as necessary for hypotension.  Eventually the patient
required blood pressure support with pressors.  These were
required intermittently.  During the week of [**2706-4-22**],
the patient's pressor requirement remained high requiring
large doses of Neo-Synephrine which were unable to be weaned
previously in the patient's course, his pressor requirement
was intermittent but during the days between [**4-22**] and
[**4-26**], the patient's pressor requirements remained steady
and high and he was unable to be weaned to lower doses.

4.  Atrial fibrillation:  The patient developed periods of
atrial fibrillation throughout the course of the
hospitalization.  Initially these were responsive to
diltiazem or spontaneously converted on their own.  One
episode was associated with hypotension and the patient was
attempted for DC cardioversion.  He did not respond to this
and an amiodarone drip was started along with blood pressure
support from pressors.  The patient spontaneously converted
on this.  He was then maintained on amiodarone po.  He
suffered from one additional atrial fibrillation episode.  An
amiodarone drip was started again and the patient was
returned to amiodarone po.  He was also seen in consultation
by the Cardiology Service who recommended amiodarone
intravenous and po, as was executed.

5.  Endocrine:  Given the patient's pressor requirements, it
was presumed that the patient was potentially adrenally
insufficient and would benefit from steroids.  He was
maintained on intravenous hydrocortisone throughout the
course of the admission.

6.  Fluid status:  The patient received large amounts of
intravenous fluids to support his blood pressure throughout
the admission.  He was ultimately 22 liters positive for the
length of stay.  By [**2706-4-26**], attempts to diurese the
patient with Lasix were met with hypotension and episodes of
atrial fibrillation as described above.  The patient's
intravenous medications were double concentrated in order to
minimize the patient's intravenous input, however, attempts
to remove fluid were unsuccessful as described above.

7.  Access:  The patient received central lines for
administration of intravenous medications and arterial lines
for hemodynamic monitoring.  On [**2706-4-20**], during a
routine change of the patient's central line for question
infection, the patient suffered a complication of internal
jugular catheter placement.  He had a tension pneumothorax
with hypotension and decreased oxygen saturations.  Needle
thoracostomy was performed immediately and the patient's
blood pressure returned.  A chest tube was placed thereafter.
The patient's family was informed of these complications and
he suffered no further complications from the chest tube.

8.  Disposition:  During the week of [**2706-4-22**], it
became apparent that the patient's prognosis was poor, that
multiple attempts to decrease sedation, ventilatory support
and pressors were unsuccessful.  The patient's family felt
that the patient would not want to live with this degree of
life support and began discussions regarding withdrawal of
care.  One of the patient's sons, however, was in
disagreement regarding this plan.  Talks continued and
ultimately on [**2706-4-25**], the patient's family was in
agreement that the patient should be ""Do Not Resuscitate"" and
they intended to withdrawal care the following day.  On [**2706-4-26**], the patient's family came to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit and agreed to withdrawal care from the patient.

At approximately 10:30 in the morning, the patient's life
support was discontinued.  The patient was extubated and
pressors were turned off.  He was kept comfortable with
morphine drip and bolus along with intravenous Ativan.  The
patient's vital signs declined throughout the remaining
course of the day.  The patient appeared with comfortable
with measures taken.  The patient's family remained with the
patient at the patient's bedside.  At 13:22 on [**2706-4-26**], the patient appeared to be deceased.  Examination
confirmed this and the patient was pronounced dead at 1:22 in
the afternoon on [**2706-4-26**].  A postmortem examination
was refused by the family who was at the patient's bedside.

CV: Pt moving along fine until 10pm when his BP began to start dropping again. So, he was given 500cc NS IVB with little rsp, so ... a 2nd IVB given and then he had a burst of AF/Afltter which broke on his own. But At 12:20pm he went into a rapid Aflutter with rate up to 150. His BP did not change but after he was given a 20mg IVP of Diltiazem, his BP began to drop more. He was than restarted back on po Dig (dose given at 2am). His o2 sat also began to drop and he was supported with an increase of his Fio2 to 70% and than PEEP up to 10cm. His Aflutter persisted with rates of 110-152 and BP dropping to low of 74/. CArotid massage attempt and failed. AT 3:15am, his BP was down to 70/ so a 3rd 500cc NS ivb given and PEEP dropped back to 7.5. Finally at 4:55am he broke back into his NSR rate of 75 and his BP increase to 90's. EKG and CPK's done.
Resp: as noted above, pt cont now on 70%  A/C 550 x22 with 7.5 PEEP. He cont with blood tinged sputum though it appears sl less than yesterday. His O@ Sats have stayed 92-93% and he cont t deasat to 88% when coughing. His sedation remains the same Ativan/Fentanyl, no changes made. He is easily arousable and follows commands.

                         Review of Systems

Neuro- Pt sedation decreased this am to 50 mcg/hr of Fetanyl and .50 mg of Ativan, his vent settings were also changed to PS 10 and PEEP of 7.5 @ that time. Pt tolerated these changes for several hrs until he had a cardiac echo and started to become tachycardic to the 150's and went into afib/flutter. After trying a few different cardiac interventions w/ minimal effect, pt'se sedation was increased to 2 mg/hr of Ativan and 100 mcgs/hr of Fetanyl with [**Doctor Last Name 6123**] effect. PERRLA, bsk. MAE.

CV- PT has had several cardiac issues over the course of the day. Currently  HR 90's, NSR. This morning while pt was getting a cardiac echo @ the bedside to look for a murmur, pt switched from NSR to  Sinus tach to Afib/Aflutter. An EKG was done which showed some St depression in V4/V5, pt was determined to be in afib at that time. Team was at the bedside and ordered 20 mg Diltiazem IV push , 15 min later he received another 10 mg IV push per the teams request. Pt's HR decreased transiently, so he was started on a Diltiazem gtt.  Over the course of the afternoon, pt's was titrated up to the max dose, team decided to load him on Amiodorone. Prior to starting the Amiodorone, pt found to have a temp of 102.9, bld cultures were sent and he received PR Tylenol. His HR then dropped to the 90's and his MAP also decreased to the mid 50's, so the amiodorone was not given. Started on Heparin gtt per protocol @ 1400 U/hr, please do 6 hr follow up PTT @ 1930. Please cont to monitor closely with team.

Resp- Pt tolerated PS for a few hrs this morning, but after spiking a temp and having several cardiac problems he was returned to his previous settings on AC. Please refer to CV fo all ABG results and vent changes on these settings. LS clr in upper lobes, coarse in bases.  Sats 94%. Sx q3-4 hrs for scant to sm amounts of thick, yellow sputum.

GI- Abs soft, +BS, +BM X1 after receiving a ducolax suppository.  TF @ 60 cc/hr, goal 75. 

GU- FB since midnight +449. Adequate U/O, clr, yellow. 

ID- Max temp 102.9. Pt received tylenol X1; 650mg PR. Continues on antibiotic therapy; Levoquin day 6 of 10.

Plan- Monitor CV status closley. Manage resp. status and cont w/ pulm. toliet as needed. Continue tx w/ antibiotics. Monitor neuro status and titrate fetanyl and ativan gtts for comfort. Continue to monitor fever curve and manage all temps, follow up on bld cultures. Assess resolving ARDS. Pt's family met w/ team regarding prognosis and established a goal of extubation w/in 4 to 5 days.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  84-year-old gentleman with concern for loculated left pleural
     effusion.  Patient is in [**Hospital Unit Name 492**] with ARDS.
     
     COMPARISON: Chest radiographs from [**3-17**] and [**4-14**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous helical images of the chest were obtained following the
     administration of IV contrast.
     
     CONTRAST:  100 cc of Optiray were utilized.  Non-ionic contrast was utilized
     secondary to this patient's cardiac status and respiratory distress.
     
     CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  The heart is of normal size.  There are no
     pericardial effusions. The great vessels are unremarkable.  An endotracheal
     tube is in place with its tip below the thoracic inlet and above the carina.
     A right-sided central venous catheter has a tip that terminates within the
     distal SVC.  There is neither mediastinal hilar nor axillary lymphadenopathy.
     
     Evaluation of the airways demonstrates the endotracheal tube as stated above.
     The airways are patent to the level of the segmental bronchi.
     
     Lung windows demonstrate large layering pleural effusions bilaterally.  No
     significant loculated components to the pleural effusions are present.  There
     is extensive emphysema present.  Particularly within the left upper lobe there
     is a stacked appearance of cysts consistent with honeycombing.  Several
     additional areas of subpleural cystic areas are noted.
     
     Bilateral passive atelectasis is present.  Traction bronchiectasis is
     identified, particularly within the lower lobes.  This is associated with
     patchy linear areas of opacification.
     
     Limited views of the upper abdomen demonstrate that the liver is of normal
     size and attenuation without intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation.  Note is
     made in the left lobe of the liver of an approximately 9 mm non-enhancing low
     attenuation lesion that likely represents a cyst.  Several other low
     attenuation non-enhancing foci are identified that are too small to
     characterize.  Note is made of extensive abdominal aorta calcification.  Note
     is made, in particular, of calcification at the origin fo the right renal
     artery.  The spleen and pancreas are unremarkable.
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     
     Both kidneys are of normal size.  Note is made of abnormality to the contours
     of both kidneys.  This could be secondary to prior infarct.  Along the upper
     pole of the left kidney is an approximately 1.5 cm low attenuation non-
     enhancing focus that could represent a cyst, but is not definitive.  There is
     no upper abdominal lymphadenopathy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Neither sclerotic nor lytic bone lesions are identified.
     Degenerative changes are present throughout the thoracic spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Bilateral layering pleural effusions. No large loculated components are
     identified.
     
     2)  Findings most consistent with ARDS with organizing fibrosis. A component
     of superimposed pneumonia or fluid overload cannot be excluded.
     
     3)  Low attenuation lesions identified within the left kidney and the liver
     that could represent cysts. As well, findings suggestive of possible scarring
     of both kidneys is identified.  Both the liver and the kidneys can be further
     evaluated with abdominal ultrasound.
     
     4)  Extensive emphysema.

                          Review of Systems

Neuro- Pt. cont to require 150 mcg/hr of Fetanyl and 4 mg/hr of Ativan. He has had a very eventful day and required several boluses, when he is not adequately ssedated he desaturates. The plan once this pt settles is to begin to wean his sedation by 20% a day. He arouses to voice and stimuli, does not follow commands. PERRLA, bsk.

CV- HR 60-80's, NSR, w/ occasional PVC's. Continues on PO Amiodorone. PT experienced increased hypotension w/ the development of a pneumothorax and had to be restarted on Neosynepherine, currently @ 80 mcg/min, goal MAPs are to be greater than 65. Last K+ 3.9, 20 meq IV ordered for repletion.  

Resp- PT started the day on CPAP and PS,  he had his R pleural effusion tapped followed by a line re-siting. This led to the  development of a L pneumothorax. The team inserted a thorcentesis while awaiting the placement of a chest tube. The the chest tube is connected to wall suction and has a positive leak and fluctuation. Initially serosanguinous fld drained from the site, it is now sanguinous. After the chest tube was placed and the xray reviewed the team retracted it 2 cm, the follow up xray to this change is pending, please follow up w/ team. Current vent settings AC 700x20x7.5 PEEPx100%. The last ABG at this setting 7.46/43/94/32/5. The plan is to wean the FIO2 as the pt tolerates. Sats 99%.  LS coarse in upper lobes w/ crackles in the bases. 

GI- Respalor continues to infuse @ 50c/hr, abd soft, +BS,+BM: bwn liquid, rectal bag in place. Awaiting c-diff results from specimen sent.

GU- Adequate U/O yellow, foley patent. +1.7 L positive.

Access- New L IJ, placement confirmed by xray. RIJ dc'd, tip sent for culture. Aline, WNL.

Skin- Red coccyx and heels, 1st step air mattress and multipodus boots in place.  Edematous in all extremities, scrotal edema; using barrier crm and sling w/ good effect.

Heme/ID/Endo- WBC increased to 33 today, afebrile; contiues on vanco, flagyl, ceftaz. Levo dc'd. Heparin dc'd today @ 1100 for procedures, has not been restarted.  Continues on SSI and q 6 hr FS.

Plan- Monitor CV, resp, neuro and fever curve. Follow all cultures and labs w/ team. When appropriate wean sedation by 20 % a day. Maintain  adequate levels of sedation/comfort for ventilation.  Continue antibiotic coverage.

  Neuro:  Recieved pt on 150 mcg/hr fentanyl and 4 mg/hr ativan.  On these settings, pt with several periods of breakthrough agitation requiring boluses (X2 overnight) of 1-2 mg ativan.  When pt is agitated, he shakes his head back/forth, grimaces and desaturates to low 90's.  Plan to wean sedation as pts condition allows.
  CV:  Afebrile. NSR 60-80 with no episodes afib.  BP labile overnight requiring titration of neo gtt.  Currently pt's BP is 108/44 with Neo at 80 mcg/min.  When awake, pt markedly more hypertensive, but when sleeping/sedated, pressor dependency increases.  Pt restarted on heparin gtt per team at 2100 at 1200 u/hr (no initial bolus).  f/u PTT at 0300 within therapeutic goal.  Next PTT due at 0900.  AM labs significant for hct drop to 24 (previously stable around 35).  T + S sent to BB, stat repeat hct pending.  No s/sx active bleeding--CT draining mod amts serosanguinous fluid but no frank blood.  Stool remains trace heme +.
  Pulm:  Recieved PT on AC 20/700/80%/7.5 with PAP's in low 30's.  Pt initially alkalotic on ABG--rate decreased to 18 then 16 per team.  Current ABG with normal pH.  Fi02 weaned to 70% but Pa02 on this level marginal preventing further weaning.  Lungsounds present bilaterally diminished in left base.  Subcutaneous emphysema appreciated over left chest wall/left upper arm/left neck--evidently this was present on origional CXR after chest tube placed.  L CT to 20 cm water suction--draining about 150 cc  serousanguinous fluid since [**2604**].  Large air leak appreciated with each breath--pts given TV about 100 cc less than set volume (leak).  PAP stable overnight, no change in hemodynamics--plan to recheck cxr in AM.  Secretions minimal--suctioned X 3 for moderate ammounts thin white sputum.
  GI:  PT tollerating GR tubefeeds of respalor at 50 cc/hr.  ABD benign.  Large ammounts of liquid brown stool collected in FICC bag.  C-diff pending.

He has required boluses whenever care is delivered as pt acutely desats and shakes his head no to all care. Prior to these increases, pt was shaking his head yes to pn when asked. PERRLA, slug. Moves upper extremities.

CV- HR 60's, occasional PVC's noted. BP 100-147/50-90, b/c hypertensive w/ aggitation.  Neosynepherine weaned down to 20 mcg/min. Last night pt experienced some bradycardia per report. The team consulted cardiology today regarding the Amiododone dose and it was reduced to 200 mg bid.

Resp- AC 600x16x10Peepx70%. Last ABG results showed PO2 of 57 on 60% FIO2, so it was increased to it's current setting of 70%. Team attempted to wean vent support slightly today, pt did not tolerate any changes-please see CV for further details.  Sats 94% @ rest. Suctioned q 2 hrs for sc-mod amounts of thick tan/yellow secretions.  CT drained 300 cc today; sanguinous, + air leak, + fluctuation, no crepitus noted. Dsg and pleurovac changed.  LS diminished in right base w/ crackles bilaterally, coarse in upper lobes.  PT was planned for a trach today. However during rounds the pt's current state; his continous decline resulting in maximum support and overall discomfort was discussed and it was decided that these issues and the prognosis  should be discussed with his family first. His daughter and two of his sons came in to see pt and discussed plan of care options w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. At this time the family does not seem to want him trached, but his forth son has not yet arrived and they would like to have options discussed with him before a final decision is made.

GI- Restarted on Respalor @ 20cc/hr, please advance as pt tolerates. Abd soft, BS present, sm amount of bwn stool in rectal bag.

GU- 60 cc/hr of clr, yellow urine. Foley patent. 24 hr net body balance:  -833.
