Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Distress
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
 
History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 77 year old female with COPD, ESRD on HD, CAD, MVR, 
who was tranferred from an outside hospital ED already intubated 
for respiratory failure. Also with hyperkalemia. She was 
afebrile ane hemodynamically stable.
  
According to family, the patient had progressive SOB 
yesterday,despite increasing chronic home O2 from 2L to 4+L. No 
cough/fever/chills/CP. Of note, she has a h/o intubations for 
COPD flares. She was also due for HD.

Patient was treated for recent bronchitis 4 weeks ago with 
Z-Pack. She reports being well until November of last year when 
she was first hospitalized for COPD exacerbation and was 
intubated. Since then she has been intubated 3 times. She 
reports that she has been on dialysis since [**1-3**].

Patient was admitted from the ED to the MICU. She received 
kayexalate, insulin, D5 and calcium carbonate for high 
potassium. She was kept on solumedrol for 24 hours. She was 
started on Levofloxacin. She was extubated on [**7-18**]. 
 
Past Medical History:
1. COPD on chronic O2 (most recent intubation x 1yr ago)
2. ESRD on HD (T, TH, Sat) thought to be secondary to XRT for 
uterine ca
3. Uterine ca x 16 yrs ago s/p chemo/xrt
4. CAD s/p CABG x 3 [**12-4**]
5. MVR on coumadin (PCP believes this is porcine and goal INR is 
1.5-2.5; no valve seen on CXR)
6. s/p cholecystectomy
7. anxiety
8. GERD
9. restless legs. 
 
Social History:
Lives with supportive husband. Has 5 children. Ambulatory. Uses 
2L oxygen at home when active. Quit smoking one year ago. Prior 
to that smoked 1 pack every two days. Does not drink alcohol. 
 
Family History:

Sputum gram stain: 3+ gram positive cocci in 
pairs/chains/cluters
                   2+ gram negatvie rods
Sputum culture: moderate orophayngeal flora with sparse 
pseudomonas
 
Pertinent Results:
ECG: Normal sinus rhythm. First degree AV block. Probable 
anterior infarct - age undetermined. Lateral ST-T changes offer 
additional evidence of ischemia. Repolarization changes may be 
partly due to rate. Clinical correlation is suggested 
No previous tracing. Rate: 120. Intervals: PR 0 QRS 72 QT/QTc 
330/401.42 Axis: P 0 QRS 0 T 113 

CXR: The heart is enlarged. There are increased interstitial 
markings and perihilar haziness, consistent with congestive 
heart failure. Small left pleural effusion is also likely 
present. The patient is post median sternotomy and mitral valve 
replacement. An endotracheal tube terminates just proximal to 
the carina. An NG tube is seen coarsing below the diaphragm into 
the proximal stomach. 
  
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly with congestive heart failure. Low 
lying endotracheal 
tube which could be pulled back several centiimeters. 

CXR: The heart shows slight left ventricular enlargement. 
There is evidence of a prosthetic valve and prior CABG surgery. 
The pulmonary 
vessels are slightly prominent and appear slightly blurred. 
Slight left heart 
failure may be present. There is also evidence of patchy 
atelectasis at the 
left lung base behind the heart and some minor atelectasis is 
also noted in 
the right lower lobe. Interstitial changes are present in both 
lungs, mainly 
in the mid and upper zones. The endotracheal tube, the right IJ 
central line, 
and the NG line are in good position. 
  
IMPRESSION: Findings are consistent with slightly improving left 
heart 
failure. Bibasilar atelectasis is noted. Background CABG and 
prosthetic valve 
surgery. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:
77 year old woman with ESRD, COPD, CAD, MVR admitted with COPD 
exacerbation/CHF, initially intubated. Now extubated, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable.

1. Respiratory failure: Likely COPD flare with possible 
component of CHF. Patient was extubated with no event after 48 
hours and maintained on 4L O2. She was given solumedrol for 24 
hours and then transitioned to prednisone taper, serevent, 
flovent, albuterol and atrovent. She was started on levofloxacin 
for COPD flare as she had bronchitis recently and was treated 
with azithromycin and did not improve. Sputum culture was 
obtained and showed sparse growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa 
thought to be a colonizer. As the patient was not febrile and 
not producing much sputum she was not started on antibiotics. 
After hemodialysis with fluid removal patient was euvolemic. She 
was continued on ACE I for afterload reduction.

2. ESRD:  Patient received dialysis Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday 
and Monday. To have next session Thursday at [**Location (un) 6397**] [**Location (un) 3840**]. She 
was dialyzed to her 59 kg on day of discharge. On Tuesday 1.9 kg 
was removed, on Thursday 2.8 kg was removed, on Saturday 3.3 kg 
was removed adn on Monday 2.9 kg was removed. 
  
3. MVR: Patient was maintained on coumadin.   

4. CAD: Patient was contined on lipitor, beta blocker and Ace 
inhibitor.

5. Hyperkalemia: Resolved with insulin, D5, kayexalate. Now on 
dialysis. 
  
6. FEN: Heart friendly diet, 2 gm sodium, 1 liter fluid 
restriciton. No elevation of blood glucose while on prednisone.

7. Lines: Right internal jugular central line placed in 
intensive unit and removed on the floor.
  
8. family:  Husband is health care proxy.  
10. code status: full code.
