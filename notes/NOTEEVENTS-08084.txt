Admission Date:  [**2977-10-6**]       Discharge Date:  [**2977-10-19**]

Date of Birth:   [**2902-3-19**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

ADDENDUM:  The current summary will cover hospital stay from
[**2977-10-10**] through [**2977-10-19**].

1.  GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  The patient developed
progressive throat and esophageal pain and had an episode of
hematemesis in which he vomited approximately 500 cc of
blood.  GI was consulted.  The patient had an EGD which
showed esophagitis consistent with likely ischemic changes.
The patient was intubated for the EGD and transferred to the
ICU for closer monitoring.  He was started on a Pantoprazole
drip.  Following several days of the drip, he was transferred
over to p.o. Pantoprazole and his diet was slowly advanced.
He did not have any further episodes of hematemesis and his
throat discomfort resolved.

2.  RENAL FAILURE:  The patient was admitted with baseline
chronic renal insufficiency and symptoms of uremia over the
previous three months.  During the hospitalization, he had an
acute bump in his creatinine thought to be ATN from
catheterization dye load.  Renal consulted and the patient
was started on dialysis on [**2977-10-14**].  He underwent
several hemodialysis sessions to remove excess fluid and then
was started on a regimen of hemodialysis three times each
week.  The patient tolerated dialysis well.

3.  ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME:  The patient had a non-ST
elevation MI on [**2977-10-11**].  Given his acute GI
bleed, he was not a candidate for anticoagulation and instead
was managed medically.  He was established on a regimen of
Carvedilol, Captopril, hydralazine, and Isordil and was also
started on aspirin.  The plan is to start the patient on
Plavix when he is further out from his GI bleed.  His cardiac
medications were titrated up as tolerated throughout his
hospitalization.

4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was treated for C.
difficile colitis with a ten day regimen of Flagyl.  He also
developed an Enterococcus UTI and was successfully treated
with Levaquin.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS: The patient was discharged to
rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
2.  Cardiac catheterization.
3.  Chronic renal insufficiency with acute renal failure
requiring hemodialysis.
4.  Clostridium difficile colitis.
5.  Urinary tract infection.
6.  ischemic esophagitis.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Docusate 100 mg b.i.d.
2.  Fluoxetine 20 mg q.d.
3.  Hydroxyzine 25 mg b.i.d.
4.  Simvastatin 20 mg q.d.
5.  Isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg t.i.d.
6.  Aspirin 81 mg q.d.
7.  Viscous lidocaine 2% 20 ml t.i.d. p.r.n.
8.  Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. q. 12 hours.
9.  Calcium acetate 1,334 mg p.o. t.i.d. with meals.
10. Carvedilol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
11. Sliding scale insulin.
12. Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d.
13. Metoclopramide 5 mg IV q. eight hours p.r.n.
14. Metronidazole 500 mg t.i.d. times one week.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient is to follow-up with primary
care doctor in one week.  Follow-up with GI in two weeks for
repeat EGD.

     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Acute chest and back pain.
     
     Comparison is made to previous study of one day earlier.
     
     There has been interval extubation.  A right internal jugular vascular
     catheter remains in satisfactory position.  The heart is enlarged but stable.
     Slight widening of the mediastinum is also stable.  There is a persistent mild
     congestive heart failure pattern.  There is improving aeration in the left
     retrocardiac region.  Minor atelectatic changes are noted at both bases.  A
     left pleural effusion appears improved.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Improving left lower lobe atelectasis and apparent resolution of small
     left pleural effusion.
     
     2)  Persistent mild congestive heart failure.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Severe erosive esophagitis with onset of refractory chest and
     back pain.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically-acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     thoracic inlet through the lung bases, without intravenous contrast.
     Intravenous contrast was not administration given the patient's elevated
     creatinine.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The lung windows demonstrate no
     focal nodules.  This study is limited by patient respiratory motion artifact.
     There are small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.  These
     soft-tissue windows demonstrate probable thyroid nodule, one of which appears
     calcified.  The heart is moderately enlarged and the patient is status post
     CABG.  There is a moderate degree of lymphadenopathy within the prevascular
     and paratracheal regions.  The largest lymph node measures up to 1.6 cm in
     short axis.  No free air is noted within the mediastinum.  No fluid
     collections adjacent to the esophagus.  Limited images through the upper
     abdomen demonstrate no evidence of free air. Limited images through the upper
     abdomen are otherwise unremarkable. There is relatively symmetric
     gynecomastia.
     
     The osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) No evidence of free air within the mediastinum, to suggest perforation.  As
     the patient could not tolerate oral contrast, fluid leak could not be
     determined.
     2) Small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
     3) Cardiomegaly, status post CABG.
     4) Probable thyroid nodules, one of which appears calcified.
     5) Gynecomastia.
     6) Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, as described above.

     attending physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 7**] and supervising the entire procedure.
     
     The patient presented with an indwelling right internal jugular triple-lumen,
     and at the request of the ordering team this was left in place.  The left neck
     was subsequently prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.   Ultrasound
     was used to localize the left internal jugular vein which was patent and
     compressible. This was accessed with a micro-puncture needle, and a wire was
     passed into the superior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance. The micro-
     puncture catheter was advanced over the wire, and the wire was exchanged for a
     [**Doctor Last Name **] wire which was advanced into the inferior vena cava. The venous access
     site was then dilated.
     
     Attention was then directed towards creating a tunnel for the dialysis
     catheter within the left upper chest wall using blunt dissection.  Following
     this, the 14.5-French 27 cm cuff-to-tip tunneled dialysis catheter was
     advanced through the tunnel and into the left internal jugular access site.
     The tip was advanced to the cavo-atrial junction under fluoroscopic guidance.
     The catheter was sutured in place with 0-silk.  Final chest x-ray did not
     demonstate pneumothorax.

     increasing creatinine and decreasing urine output.
     
     Right kidney measures 9.9 cm in length without focal lesion or hydronephrosis.
     The left kidney measures 10.4 cm in length and is free of focal lesion or
     hydronephrosis. The cortex of both kidneys is mildly thinned. Extensive soft
     tissue attenuation made examination of the kidneys difficult and the renal
     arteries could not be interrogated. The urinary bladder was not distended and
     poorly visualized.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. No evidence of focal mass or hydronephrosis involving either kidney.

     FINDINGS: A dual lumen dialysis catheter placed by the left IJ is seen with
     tip in the upper SVC. Ideally, the tip of the catheter would be within the
     right atrium. A right sided central venous line is unchanged in position.
     There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature and several septal lines are
     seen peripherally. There is persistent retrocardiac opacification, slightly
     improved. There are no new focal areas of consolidation and there is no
     pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION: Placement of dual lumen left IJ dialysis catheter without
     pneumothorax. The tip is at the junction of the brachiocephalic and SVC.

     INDICATIONS:    Re-assessment for AV fistual creation.
     
     FINDINGS:   Cephalic veins are patent bilaterally. On the right, the cephalic
     vein is .47 cm at the antecubital fossa and gradually declines to .35 cm at
     the deltoid region.  Similar values on the left are .28 and .29 cm
     respectively. The right basilic vein measures .2 cm at the antecubital fossa
     and increases to .34 cm as it transitions into the axillary vein. The left
     basilic vein is not visualized.
     
     Both the left and right brachial arteries demonstrate a normal triphasic wave
     form indicating no arterial insufficiencies to either upper extremity.
     Additionally, both subclavian veins demonstrate normal phasicity, excluding
     any high grade central stenosis on the left or right.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Patent bilateral cephalic veins and right basilic vein, dimensions as
     described.
     
     2.  Nonvisualized left basilic vein.
     
     3.  Normal upper extremity arterial in flow bilaterally.

     INDICATION: Follow up of esophagitis, dysphagia, r/o stricture.
     
     DOUBLE CONTRAST UGI: There are no prior comparable examinations available for
     comparison. Barium flows freely through the esophagus. there are interrupted
     primary peristaltic contractions with tertiary activity. A small hiatal hernia
     of axial type is present. No free gastroesophageal reflux is detected during
     the examination. 13 mm barium tablet demonstrates prolonged impaction at the
     small axial hiatal hernia. The stomach distends and empties normally. The
     visualized portions of the duodenal bulb, loop, and visualized portions of the
     proximal small bowel appear normal in caliber and mucosal pattern.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) Small axial hiatal hernia without demonstrated gastroesophageal
     reflux. 2) Prolonged hold up of 13 mm barium tablet at the proximal portion of
     the hiatal hernia. 3) Abnormal esophageal motility with tertiary contractions.

      76 year old man with ESRD and a non-maturing R upper arm AVF.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Pt. has a R upper arm AVF that is not maturing. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10**] would like a
      fistulagram to assess the fistula to see if there are any outflow problems
      amenable to angioplasty and also to see why the fistula is not developing.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 76-year-old male with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis with
     a nonmaturing right upper arm arteriovenous fistula and complaints of right
     hand numbness and tingling.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Written informed consent was obtained. The right upper extremity
     was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Approximately 3 cc's of
     1% Lidocaine was used to anesthetize the local field.  Using a Micropuncture
     needle set, the patient's right upper extremity AV fistula was accessed using
     a 21 gauge needle. A Micropuncture sheath set was advanced over a a
     nitinol guidewire. Using the micropuncture sheath catheter, an arteriogram
     distal to the AV fistula in the right upper extremity was performed both
     before and after the IV administration of 25 mg of Papaverine. Next, a
     glidewire was used to access the brachial artery proximal to the AV fistula
     and advanced into the patient's right subclavian artery. A 4 Fr straight
     catheter was advanced over the glidewire into the right subclavian artery and
     an arteriogram of the right upper extremity to a point just distal to the AV
     fistula within the right arm was also performed. Next, the catheter was
     slighty withdrawn into the brachial artery and an arteriogram of the distal
     upper extremity was performed during the manual compression of the AV fistula.
     The catheter and sheath were then removed and manual pressure was held at the
     puncture site with good hemostasis.
     
     FINDINGS: Arteriogram of the arm distal to the AV fistula anastomosis from the
     brachial artery to the right hand shows normal arterial vascularity without
     evidence of stenosis or occlusion to the level of the digital arteries.
     Arteriogram of the proximal upper extremity demonstrates patency from the
     level of the AV fistula anastomosis to the superior vena cava without stenosis
     or obstruction ti flow. However, dynamic images demonstrate increased and
     rapid flow across the AV fistula, with only minimal flow through the distal
     brachial artery to the hand. Manual compression of the fistula and subsequent
     arteriogram of the distal upper extremity showed improvement of flow into the
     distal brachial artery and hand.
     
     MEDICATIONS: 100 cc of IV Optiray 320. Versed, .5 mg. Fentanyl, 25 mcg.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: None.
