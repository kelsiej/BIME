Service:  GEN SURGER

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 12319**] is an 83-year-old
male with a past medical history significant for coronary
artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, and peripheral
vascular disease, who had undergone prior peripheral vascular
operations, and presented to the hospital on [**3116-3-20**]
with an infection of a thigh wound status post a left femoral

retinopathy.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Peripheral vascular disease.
4.  Osteoarthritis.
5.  Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of
1.7 to 2.1.
6.  Coronary artery disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  A left femoral to perineal bypass with insitu saphenous
vein graft.
2.  Cataract repair.
3.  Laser eye surgery.
4.  Status post a left fifth metacarpal phalangeal joint
resection.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Lasix 20 mg po q.d.
2.  Lopressor 50 mg po q.d.
3.  Zestril.
4.  Aspirin 325 mg po q.d.

7.  NPH insulin 20 units q.a.m. and 15 units q.h.s.
8.  A regular insulin sliding scale.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has no significant tobacco or
alcohol history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 12319**] was found to
be an alert white male in no acute distress.  His heart rate
was 62 beats per minute in sinus rhythm.  His blood pressure
was 120/50, with a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute.
He was found to be normocephalic with a supple neck and no
lymphadenopathy.  His trachea was in the midline.  His lungs
were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His heart showed a
regular rate and rhythm with normal S1, S2, as well as no
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  His abdomen was soft, nontender,
and nondistended with no hepatosplenomegaly or other palpable
masses.  His left thigh showed an area of induration on the
medial aspect with a slightly open area which was draining
fluid.  It was able to be probed medially.  In terms of
neurological status, he was alert and oriented to person,
place and time, and his gross motor and sensory functions
were intact.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 12319**] was initially admitted to the
Vascular Surgical Service on [**3116-3-20**] in order to deal
with his postoperative wound infection.  He was started on
antibiotics at that time.  The Renal and Cardiology Services
were consulted to help follow this patient due to standing
cardiac and renal issues.  He was also followed by the [**Hospital **]
Clinic in regards to his diabetes.

On hospital day number five, the patient was noted to vomit
750 mL of blood while on the regular patient floor.  The
patient was noted to have no prior history of peptic ulcer
disease, and at that time was on aspirin and prophylactic
doses of subcutaneous heparin to prevent deep vein
thrombosis.  At the time, the patient denied having any chest
pain, shortness of breath or abdominal discomfort.  At this
time, large bore intravenous access was obtained and a
nasogastric tube was placed with return of dark fluid with
blood clots.  He was continuously lavaged without clearing.

Due to changes at this time in his hemodynamic stability, he
was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit and seen by the
Gastroenterology Service in consult for potential therapeutic
endoscopy.  Once in the Intensive Care Unit, he was actively
repleted with packed red blood cells, crystalloid, as well as
blood products to maximize his coagulation factors.  An
esophagogastroduodenoscopy was carried out that night,
Friday, [**3116-3-24**], and showed a normal esophagus, as
well as localized erythema and erosions of the mucosa of the
stomach with stigmata of recent bleeding.  One of the sites
that was observed was treated with BICAP cautery.  The
duodenum was found to be normal in appearance.  At this time,
the patient also developed atrial fibrillation.  His blood
pressure did remain stable, and he was continually transfused
with red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma.  His rhythm was
corrected using beta-blockade, and the patient remained
hemodynamically stable at that time.

On hospital day number six, [**3-25**], blood was again noted
to be coming from the nasogastric tube.  At this time, the
patient went into respiratory arrest and was emergently
intubated.  It was noted that there was a good deal of blood
aspirated through the endotracheal tube.  The patient was
resuscitated and again scoped by the Gastroenterology
Service, where a large amount of blood was found in the
esophagus and stomach.  He at that time was evaluated by the
General Surgery Service in consult, and the decision was made
to take the patient to the Operating Room.

The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**3116-3-25**]
where he was underwent an exploratory laparotomy, a subtotal
gastrectomy, an incidental splenectomy, a Roux-en-y
gastrojejunostomy, as well as a placement of a feeding
jejunostomy tube.  Please refer to the dictated operative
note for full details of this procedure.  It was found
intraoperatively, that the patient's stomach was distended
with multiple punctate ulcers throughout, as well as a good
deal of clotted blood.  The patient tolerated the procedure
and was transferred postoperatively back to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit.

At this time, the patient was also quite acidotic with a
lactate of 5.7, he had a potassium of 6.1, as well as a
creatinine elevated well above his baseline.  He continued to
be followed by the Renal Service in consult for these issues.
Due to the acute blood loss and hemodynamic instability form
the patient's upper gastrointestinal bleed and surgical
procedure, he was found to have had a perioperative
myocardial infarction.  His troponin rose as high at 33.8, as
well as having an elevated CK-MB fraction and index.  His
creatinine at this time was 2.4.  His hematocrit was 25.7.
He was continued to be followed by the Cardiology Service for
these issues.  He slowly began to recover remaining intubated
in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.  Tube feeds at a rate of
10 cc per hour were started a few days later.

On postoperative day number three, the patient was found to
be awake and following commands.  He was also found to have
recurrent atrial fibrillation.  His oxygenation and
hemodynamic remained stable however.  On postoperative day
number five, the tube feeds were at goal, and continued
ventilator weaning was being undertaken.  At this time, also,
the patient was found to have yeast growing in 1/4 blood
culture bottles.  The patient was extubated successfully on
postoperative day number seven, which he tolerated fairly
well.  He continued to have brief periods of atrial
fibrillation, but did convert back into normal sinus rhythm.

The patient was started on antifungal medication to treat the
yeast which had grown from his blood culture.  He was seen by
the Infectious Disease Service in consult at that time.  A
surface echocardiogram was done to look for valvular
vegetations which were not seen.  During this echocardiogram,
it was noted that his left ventricular ejection fraction was
20-30%.  Per the Infectious Disease Service, the patient was
started on Caspofungin as therapy for his fungemia.  He also
was experiencing diarrhea, and for that reason was started on
oral vancomycin.  His subsequent blood cultures on the 22nd
and [**4-7**] were negative.  An attempt was made to
start the patient on anticoagulation for his atrial
fibrillation, but he prompted developed bright red blood per
rectum, so this was immediately stopped.  His creatinine
slowly began to normalize, as did his white blood cell count.
His hematocrit remained stable.

The patient underwent a speech and swallowing evaluation at
this time, and it was found that he was in danger of
aspiration for thin liquids, but he was clear to drink nectar
thick liquids, as well as pureed foods and very soft solids.
On postoperative day number 19, the patient was deemed stable
and ready for transfer to the regular patient floor.  Since
that time, he has done quite well.  He is tolerating his tube
feeds which are Nepro full strength at 45 cc an hour without
any difficulty.  He is tolerating oral intake consisting of
nectar thick liquids and very soft solids without any
difficulty.  He remains afebrile and his creatinine has
normalized back to its baseline level.  His white blood cell
count has also been fine.  The patient is afebrile and
following commands, communicating easily.

On postoperative day number 25, it was deemed that the
patient was medically and surgically stable and ready for
discharge from the hospital.  It is, however, necessary that
he be discharged to an extended care facility as his
hospitalization has caused him to become quite physically
debilitated and he will require much help in this area.  It
is also necessary that he continue to be on the antifungal
medication for another five weeks.

DISPOSITION:  To an extended care hospital facility.

PATIENT ACTIVITY:  Patient requires a great deal of
assistance in order to be able to get out of bed and perform
his activities of daily living at this time.

PATIENT'S DIET:  The patient must not be allowed to have thin
liquids of any kind pending further speech and swallow
evaluated, but because at this time, he is at risk for silent
aspiration of thin liquids.  He is permitted to have nectar
thick liquids, as well as purees and very soft solids.  His
diet should consist of a diabetic and cardiac formulation due
to those two disease processes in this gentlemen.

PATIENT'S MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lasix 20 mg per J tube q.d.
2.  Caspofungin acetate 35 mg intravenous q.d.  The patient
has a left-sided PICC line.
3.  Heparin 5,000 units subcutaneously q. 12 hours.
4.  Lopressor 25 mg po t.i.d.
5.  NPH insulin 25 units q. 12 hours.
6.  A regular insulin sliding scale.
7.  Benadryl 25 mg po q.h.s. prn.
8.  Amiodarone 400 mg po q.d.
9.  Lansoprazole oral solution 30 mg po q.d.
10. Atrovent nebulizer solution q. 6 hours prn.
11. Albuterol nebulizer solution q. 6 hours prn.
12. Epogen 10,000 subcutaneously q. week on Wednesday's.

It should be noted at this time, that the patient should not
be given any other type of anticoagulation other than the
subcutaneous heparin, which he is on for deep vein thrombosis
and pulmonary embolus prophylaxis, and which he has thus far
tolerated.  The patient will be leaving with one
[**Location (un) 1275**]-[**Location (un) **] drain in his abdomen which should be emptied
and recorded on an as needed basis.  He has a jejunostomy
tube through which he is being fed and should continue to be
fed with this Nepro at 45 cc an hour.  The patient also has a
venostasis ulcer on the medial aspect of his left leg which
will need to be cared for.  As the patient has been restarted
on his Lasix, his peripheral edema should decrease somewhat,
but the patient should continue to receive bilateral ACE
wraps of both legs, which should include the feet and go to
the knee, bilateral leg elevation at all times, as well as
Venodynes, and multipodis splint for protection or in
alternative sheep skin to the foot of his bed to protect his
heels from further breakdown.

FOLLOW-UP:  Follow-up should be with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12320**] of the
General Surgery Department at the [**Hospital6 2460**].  The patient may call for a specific
appointment and time.  There should also be follow-up with
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 389**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8460**], of the Infectious Disease Department, on
[**5-1**] at 9:30 a.m.  She has requested that the patient
undergo a CAT scan of his abdomen on [**4-27**] and to have his
results with him when he arrives.  She has also requested
that liver function enzymes be checked once per week so that
Caspofungin toxicity if evident, may be monitored.  These
results should be faxed to [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3206**].  Dr.[**Hospital 12321**] clinic
number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2296**].

     INDICATION:  Left and right bypass grafts.  Left bypass graft demonstrates the
     occluded, left groin infection, left foot rest pain.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Procedure performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 3657**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 512**], [**Name5 (PTitle) **]
     radiologist who was present and supervised the procedure.
     
     MEDICATION & CONTRAST:  4 cc subcutaneous Lidocaine administered to the right
     groin; 100 cc of Visipaque non-ionic contrast administered due to patient's
     renal status.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE:  The patient was informed of the details and associated
     risks of the procedure and written consent was obtained.
     
     The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table and the right groin
     was prepped and draped in usual fashion.  Under fluoroscopic observation, the
     right common femoral artery was accessed using a 19 gauge single wall puncture
     needle.  A 0.035"" [**Location (un) 935**] wire was then advanced into the abdominal aorta and
     the puncture needle was exchanged for a 4 French sheath with side arm flush.
     An 4 French Omniflush catheter was then advanced into the abdominal aorta and
     the [**Location (un) 935**] wire was exchanged for a 0.035"" angle glidewire.  The omniflush
     catheter was then directed into the left external iliac artery over an 035""
     glidewire.  Serial arteriograms of the left lower extremity were then
     obtained.  Arterial pressure was measured within the left external iliac wire,
     common iliac artery, aorta, right common and right external iliac artery and
     no pressure gradient was demonstrated.  The catheter and sheath were then
     removed and hemostasis was obtained.  There were no immediate complications
     and the patient tolerated the procedure well.
     
     FINDINGS:  The left common femoral artery and superficial femoral artery are
     patent.  The bypass graft which appears to be arising from the superficial
     femoral artery is occluded.  There is severe disease of the above and below
     knee popliteal arteries.  The anterior tibial artery is occluded at the mid-
     calf and there is significant stenoses at the takeoff of the anterior tibial
     artery.  The anterior tibial artery is then reconstituted at as a small vessel
     above the ankle.  The dorsalis pedis artery is  not patent.  The posterior
     tibial artery is occluded.  The proximal peroneal artery has multifocal severe
     stenoses and a peroneal artery fills at the distal calf via  collaterals.  The
     anterior foot is predominantly supplied by collaterals by the distal anterior
                                                                 (Over)

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      84 year old man                                                                 
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Lt thigh USPatient after fem-[**Hospital Unit Name 609**] 2000. developed lymphocele in SVG harvesting 
      site in lt thigh which is now infected but open and draining. spiked temps X2 
      days on vanco/levo/flagyl. Looking for ?undrained collections in lt thigh. 
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Patient had a fem/[**Hospital Unit Name 609**] in [**3112**] and subsequently developed a
     lymphocele at the SVG harvesting site which is clinically infected.
     
     FINDINGS:  Targeted scanning in the region of the open draining wound on the
     medial left thigh reveals a predominantly hypoechoic but heterogeneous
     collection measuring 6 x 3.5 x 1 cm (craniocaudal, transverse,
     anteriorposterior).  This collection parallels the scar, is located
     approximately 1 cm deep to the skin, and is located approximately 1 cm medial
     to the scar. Within the collection are multiple hyperechoic foci that shadow.
     The largest such foci corresponds to the wick that has been stuffed into the
     wound.  The smaller foci of increased echogenicity may represent small air
     bubbles.  The collection has the appearance of hematoma or thick fluid.
     As this does not appear to be a simple fluid collection, simple percutaneous
     needle drainage was deferred.  After discussions within the responsible
     surgical house staff, the patient was sent back up stairs for incision and
     drainage. The location of the collection was marked on the skin with a
     permanant marker to aid the surgical house staff.

     A SINGLE AP SUPINE VIEW OF CHEST: Comparison study [**3116-3-26**].
     
     The heart shows moderate LV enlargement.  There is evidence of ill-defined
     patchy pulmonary infiltrates bilaterally, slightly more prominent on the left
     side.  These obscure the vessels.  The infiltrates  are slightly more
     extensive than on prior study.  There is also evidence  of left lower lobe
     collapse and consolidation.  Some blunting of the left CP angle is noted,
     consistent with a small effusion.  The right CP angle is not displayed. A new
     left subclavian central line is noted with its tip at the upper end of the
     SVC.  The ET tube has been removed.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Worsening ill-defined pulmonary infiltrates bilaterally.
     Persistent left lower lobe collapse/consolidation.  The left IJ line tip is in
     the upper SVC.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Patient is S/P gastrectomy for upper GI bleed with bilious cloudy
     output from JP drain.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images of the abdomen and
     pelvis with oral contrast only.
     
     ABDOMINAL CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST FINDINGS:  There are moderate bilateral
     pleural effusions, right greater than left.  There is a 3.6 cm low attenuation
     lesion identified within the spleen.  This may represent a splenic infarct.
     As intravenous contrast was not administered, evaluation of the splenic vein
     and arteries is limited.  There is no evidence of abscess.  The gallbladder is
     distended and there are two gallstones.  Two surgical drains identified in the
     left upper quadrant of the abdomen.  The pancreas is somewhat atrophic.  There
     is small, triangular shaped area of hypoattenuation in segment 2B of the
     liver.  This may represent retraction injury. There is no evidence of
     hemorrhage.  The intrahepatic bile ducts are not dilated.  There is a 1.6 cm
     simple cyst in the mid-portion of the left kidney.  There are no
     pathologically enlarged peritoneal or retroperitoneal lymph nodes.  The
     patient is S/P gastrectomy.  There is no evidence of leak around the
     anastomotic site.
     
     CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST FINDINGS: There is no free fluid.  There is
     minimal air within the bladder, likely from Foley catheter insertion.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate degenerative changes in the lumbar spine.
     
     CONCLUSION:  1)  Low attenuation lesion in the spleen, as described above.
     This may represent a splenic infarct.  As contrast was not administered,
     evaluation of the splenic artery and veins is limited.
     
     2)  No evidence of abscess.
     
     3)  Gallstones and distended gallbladder.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      84 year old man with                                                            
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      84 M S/P GASTRECTOMY FOR UGIB, NOW WITH BILIOUS/CLOUDY OUTPUT FROM JP WHICH IS 
      GROWING YEAST AND ENTEROCOCCUS. PLEASE EVALUATE FOR FLUID COLLECTIONS, DUODENAL 
      STUMP.  MAY GIVE PO AND J-TUBE CONTRAST.  NO IV CONTRAST. POSSIBLE DRAINAGE.
     CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST:
      ELEVATED CREATININE
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Patient is S/P gastrectomy for upper GI bleed with bilious cloudy
     output from JP drain.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images of the abdomen and
     pelvis with oral contrast only.
     
     ABDOMINAL CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST FINDINGS:  There are moderate bilateral
     pleural effusions, right greater than left.  There is a 3.6 cm low attenuation
     lesion identified within the spleen.  This may represent a splenic infarct.
     As intravenous contrast was not administered, evaluation of the splenic vein
     and arteries is limited.  There is no evidence of abscess.  The gallbladder is
     distended and there are two gallstones.  Two surgical drains identified in the
     left upper quadrant of the abdomen.  The pancreas is somewhat atrophic.  There
     is small, triangular shaped area of hypoattenuation in segment 2B of the
     liver.  This may represent retraction injury. There is no evidence of
     hemorrhage.  The intrahepatic bile ducts are not dilated.  There is a 1.6 cm
     simple cyst in the mid-portion of the left kidney.  There are no
     pathologically enlarged peritoneal or retroperitoneal lymph nodes.  The
     patient is S/P gastrectomy.  There is no evidence of leak around the
     anastomotic site.
     
     CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST FINDINGS: There is no free fluid.  There is
     minimal air within the bladder, likely from Foley catheter insertion.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate degenerative changes in the lumbar spine.
     
     CONCLUSION:  1)  Low attenuation lesion in the spleen, as described above.
     This may represent a splenic infarct.  As contrast was not administered,
     evaluation of the splenic artery and veins is limited.
     
     2)  No evidence of abscess.
     
     3)  Gallstones and distended gallbladder.

     Comparison is made to study of [**3116-4-3**] at 0110.
     
     FINDINGS: The left CPA angle has been excluded from the study. Given technique
     and lung volumes the heart size is likely normal. There is a stable
     retrocardiac opacity. An ill-defined hazy opacity throughout the left lung
     which partially obscures the vessels is likely a layering effusion. The right
     lung appears clear. A right sided IJ central venous line terminates in the
     upper SVC. A left sided subclavian central venous line also terminates in the
     upper SVC. There is no pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION: Worsening layering left effusion. Continued clearing of the right
     lung. No pneumothorax.

     upper lung zone redistribution of pulmonary blood flow, which may indicate
     mild CHF. Osseous structures are unchanged.  The left subclavian central
     venous line has been removed.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Allowing for the postural differences, no significant change in
     appearance of lungs.  Mild CHF.

      84 year old man s/p near-total gastrectomy, splenectomy, and roux-en-Y 
      anastomosis for UGI, complicated post-operatively by fungemia.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Please place PICC line for long-term IV anti-fungal therapy in anticipation of

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: Status post near-total gastrectomy and splenectomy. Will need long-
     term antifungal therapy in anticipation of discharge.
     
     PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 389**], with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 389**] being present and supervising. The left upper arm is prepped in sterile
     fashion. Since no suitable superficial veins were visible ultrasound was used
     for localization of a suitable vein. The brachial vein was patent and
     compressible. After local anesthesia with 2 cc of 1% lidocaine, the brachial
     vein was entered under ultrasonic guidance with a 21 gauge needle. A 0.018
     guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopy to the superior vena cava. Based on
     the markers on the guidewire it was determined that a length of 48 cm would be
     suitable. The PICC line was trimmed to length and advanced over a 4 Fr
     introducer sheath under fluoroscopic guidance into the superior vena cava. The
     sheath was removed. The catheter was flushed. A final chest x-ray was
     obtained. The film demonstrates the tip to be in the superior vena cava. The
     line is ready for use.
     
     A StatLock was applied and the line was heplocked.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 48 cm total length PICC line with tip in
     superior vena cava, ready for use.
