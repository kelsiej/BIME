Admission Date:  [**3020-11-21**]       Discharge Date:  [**3020-11-22**]

Date of Birth:                    Sex:  M

Service:  TRAUMA SURGERY

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Pedetrian struck.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Severe closed head injury.
2.  Left pneumothorax.
3.  Left clavicle fracture.
4.  Left humerus fracture.
5.  Hypotension.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 55-year-old
male pedestrian who was struck while crossing the street.  He
was found with a GCS of 5 at the scene.  A nasotracheal
intubation was successfully undertake, and the patient was
transferred emergently to the [**Hospital6 402**] Emergency Room for evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.

ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Unknown.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Heart rate 48, blood
pressure 83/23, oxygen saturation 100% on ventilator.
General:  He was intubated with a GCS of 3.  HEENT:  His
pupils were fixed and dilated at 6 mm bilaterally.  He had a
depressed skull fracture with severe facial trauma and blood
coming from both ears.  He had no respiratory effort.  Chest:
Clear.  Heart:  Bradycardiac and regular.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Negative fast exam.  Extremities:
his left upper extremity had an obvious deformity.  His
distal extremities had no obvious deformities with palpable
pulses.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission hematocrit was 38; INR 1.3;
lactate 2.6.

IMAGING:  1.  On admission chest x-ray showed small left
pneumothorax, left clavicle fracture, and left rib fractures.
2.  Pelvis with no fracture.  3.  CT of head with
pneumocephalus, subarachnoid hemorrhage on the left and open
skull fracture.  4.  CT of cervical spine with a C6 facet
fracture.  5.  CT of chest with a pneumothorax and left
hemothorax.  6.  CT of abdomen and pelvis with no
abnormalities.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was seen in the Trauma Bay at
[**Hospital6 **] Emergency Room where he was
evaluated.  After plain films were obtained and initial
survey was done, he was taken emergently for imaging.

Given the fact that he had a severe closed head injury with a
negative fast exam, it was felt that his bradycardia and
hypotension was likely secondary to impending herniation, and
Neurosurgery consult was obtained.  They deemed it necessary
to place a ventriculostomy.  They recommended Mannitol and a
repeat head CT.

The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.  A
left chest tube was placed.  The patient was resuscitated.
His hemodynamic instability progressed, and he began to
require Levophed for his blood pressure and cardiac output.

Given the gravity of his closed head injury, a discussion was
held with the family, and they elected to make the patient
comfort measures only.  They also elected to speak with the
[**Location (un) **] Organ Bank.  They did elect for organ donation
with the patient being a donor after cardiac death.

The patient was given intravenous fluids over night, and on
[**3020-11-22**], the patient was taken to the Operating Room
on a Morphine drip.  The patient was extubated at 11:45 a.m.
He was then without a heart beat pulse or respiratory effort
or electrical activity at 11:54 a.m.  A decision was made for
made at 11:59.

     INDICATION:  39-year-old man struck by a car, evaluate line placement.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph from the same day at 15:59.
     There is a new right subclavian Swan-Ganz catheter whose tip is in an
     interlobar right pulmonary artery.  The nasogastric tube is again seen whose
     tip is not included on the film but is at least below the diaphragm.  The
     left-sided chest tube is unchanged in position.  The side hole is very close
     to the left chest wall.  The subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall not
     significantly changed.  There is worsening opacity at the both lung bases most
     likely due to a component of effusion and atelectasis. There are fractures of
     the left clavicle, left scapula, and left ribs, not changed.  The endotracheal
     tube tip is high, at the level of the T1-2 junction.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Appropriate placement of the Swan-Ganz catheter.
     
     2)  Endotracheal tube is high at the T1-T2 level.
     
     3)  Remaining lines and tubes are unchanged in position with the side hole of
     the left chest tube near the edge of the thorax.
     
     4)  Increased effusion at the right lung base and bilateral
     atelectasis/contusion.

     INDICATION:  Trauma.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were
     obtained following the administration of 150 cc of Optiray for the trauma
     protocol.  Multiplanar reformatted images of the chest were included.
     
     CTA OF THE CHEST:  The heart and great vessels are intact and within normal
     limits.  There is a large, approximately 50% left-sided pneumothorax with high
     density pleural fluid, compatible with a hemopneumothorax.  In addition, there
     is evidence of contusion involving the left lung.  Minor atelectatic changes
     at the right lung base are evident.  Subcutaneous air is present within the
     soft tissues of the left chest wall adjacent to a left 6th rib fracture.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is periportal edema,
     pericholecystic fluid, and edema of the small bowel, compatible with massive
     volume resuscitation.  Otherwise, the liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas,
     kidneys, and adrenal glands appear normal.  There is no evidence of traumatic
     injury to the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a Foley within the urinary
     bladder.  Pelvic loops of bowel are within normal limits.  There is no free
     fluid within the pelvis.  Of note, at this time, contrast has not reached to
     the bladder, limiting evaluation.  Note is made of air within the right
     femoral vein at the site of line placement.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Fractures of the left 1st, 5th and 6th ribs are evident.  In
     addition, there is a three part fracture of the left scapula.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Coronal sagittal reformatted images of the chest were

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Trauma.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were
     obtained following the administration of 150 cc of Optiray for the trauma
     protocol.  Multiplanar reformatted images of the chest were included.
     
     CTA OF THE CHEST:  The heart and great vessels are intact and within normal
     limits.  There is a large, approximately 50% left-sided pneumothorax with high
     density pleural fluid, compatible with a hemopneumothorax.  In addition, there
     is evidence of contusion involving the left lung.  Minor atelectatic changes
     at the right lung base are evident.  Subcutaneous air is present within the
     soft tissues of the left chest wall adjacent to a left 6th rib fracture.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is periportal edema,
     pericholecystic fluid, and edema of the small bowel, compatible with massive
     volume resuscitation.  Otherwise, the liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas,
     kidneys, and adrenal glands appear normal.  There is no evidence of traumatic
     injury to the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a Foley within the urinary
     bladder.  Pelvic loops of bowel are within normal limits.  There is no free
     fluid within the pelvis.  Of note, at this time, contrast has not reached to
     the bladder, limiting evaluation.  Note is made of air within the right
     femoral vein at the site of line placement.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Fractures of the left 1st, 5th and 6th ribs are evident.  In
     addition, there is a three part fracture of the left scapula.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Coronal sagittal reformatted images of the chest were
     reviewed and confirm the above findings.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Large left hemopneumothorax.
     2)  Multiple fractures as described above involving the left 1st, 5th, and 6th
     ribs, as well as the left scapula.
     3)  No evidence of traumatic injury to the abdomen or pelvis.

     INDICATION:  Ttrauma.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest and pelvis.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     FINDINGS:  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.
     There is a complete fracture through the distal-third of the left clavicle, as
     well as possible fractures through the glenoid and scapula.  There is a
     probable fracture through the left first rib. Fractures through the left fifth
     and sixth ribs are evident, with possible contusion just adjacent to the
     fracture site. There may be a left pneumothorax, although evaluation is
     limited in this study.
     
     Single AP view of the pelvis demonstrates no evidence of fractures or hip
     dislocation.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Multiple intrathoracic fractures, with a complete fracture through the
     distal-third of the left clavicle.  There may be fractures through the left
     glenoid and scapula, although evaluation with a dedicated study is
     recommended.  Fractures of the left first, fifth and sixth ribs are evident
     with likely adjacent lung contusion.
     2.  Probable left pneumothorax, with a deep sulcus sign on this examination. A
     repeat evaluation is recommended when clinically feasible.
     3.  No pelvic fractures.
