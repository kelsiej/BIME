     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      82 year old woman with h/o limited small cell.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      78 yo with limited small cell lung cancer. Follow-up chest x-ray.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  82 y/o female with history of small cell lung cancer.
     
     FINDINGS: Comparison is made to prior radiograph of [**2774-8-31**].
     
     The heart size is stable. There is evidence of left ventricular enlargement
     and an unfolded aorta.  There is evidence of decreased right sided pleural
     effusion and interval improvement of the right lower lobe infiltrate. There is
     a stable appearance of pulmonary parenchymal opacification in the region of
     the right middle lobe and a prominent region of opacity in the right perihilar
     region. There is evidence of atelectasis in the lingula.  The pulmonary
     vascularity is normal with no evidence of failure.  There is no pneumothorax.
     The soft tissues and osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION: Interval improvement with significant decreased size of right
     sided pleural effusion and improvement of right lower lobe infiltrate. Stable
     appearance of right middle lobe opacification and prominent opacity in the
     right perihilar region. Evidence of linear atelectasis in the lingula.

     COMPARISON: [**2774-8-19**]
     
     TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were
     obtained without and with IV contrast.  150 cc of nonionic IV contrast were
     administered. Nonionic IV contrast was used at patient's request.
     
     CHEST CT WITH IV CONTRAST: Soft tissue windows show interval resolution of
     mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  No axillary or hilar lymph node enlargement is
     seen.  Intrathoracic aorta has a normal caliber and exhibits extensive mural
     calcifications.  New enhancing epicardial mass is seen within the pericardial
     space.  In addition there is a very large pericardial effusion.  There is
     reflux of contrast into the IVC and hepatic veins on the arterial phase of
     contrast, suggestive of right heart failure.  New small bilateral pleural
     effusions are also seen.  Lung windows show collapse of the lingula, possibly
     compressive in nature from the enlarged cardiac contour.  Linear and patchy
     opacities in a paramedial geographic distribution are new.  No pulmonary
     nodules or masses are seen.  Airways appear patent to the level of the
     segmental bronchi bilaterally.
     
     ABDOMEN CT W/O&W IV CONTRAST: Liver has a homogeneous enhancement pattern,
     with no focal lesions.  There is no intrahepatic biliary tree dilatation.
     Gallbladder has a very edematous wall in the absence of full distention.
     Pancreas is unremarkable, with no ductal dilatation.  Spleen, stomach, small
     and large bowel, kidneys, ureters and adrenal glands are within normal limits.
     Intraabdominal aorta has a normal caliber and exhibits extensive mural
     calcifications.  There is a small amount of ascites around the liver and
     spleen.  No free air or lymphadenopathy are seen in the abdomen.
     
     PELVIC CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a small amount of ascites extending into
     the pelvis.  Rectum, pelvic loops of bowel, urinary bladder, distal ureters
     and uterus are within normal limits.  No adnexal masses or pelvic
     lymphadenopathy are seen.
     
     Osseous structures show stable Paget's disease in the pelvis.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) New enhancing epicardial mass concerning for metastatic disease. Associated
     very large new pericardial effusion.
     
     2) Findings suggestive of right heart failure, possibly secondary to
     constrictive pericardial fluid, could explain the small bilateral pleural
     effusions, edematous gallbladder wall, intraabdominal ascites and soft tissues
     anasarca.

     4) Bilateral paramediastinal pulmonary opacities appear to have a geographic

     history of radiation therapy is necessary.  Given the appearance of these
     opacities, tumor involvement is unlikely.  In the absence of prior history of
     XRT, these findings could represent an infectious/inflammatory process.
     
     5) Heavily calcified aorta with normal caliber.
     
     Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

Date of Birth:   [**2692-7-12**]     Sex:  F

Service:

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 82-year-old
female with limited stage small cell lung cancer who was
treated with three cycles of carboplatin/etoposide and
concurrent radiation therapy completed in 10/02.  Treatment
course was complicated by pneumonia and her fourth course of
chemotherapy was held.  She did relatively well until [**10-28**]
when she complained of headache.  Temporal artery biopsy was
performed and was negative, so she was put on prednisone
taper.

More recently, she has been complaining of decreased
appetite, increased shortness of breath, nausea, and
vomiting.  Laboratory work included increased LFTs.  CT scan
torso yesterday revealed a large pericardial effusion from an
epi-pericardial mass resulting in right heart failure.  She
was electively admitted for management of pericardial
effusion.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Congestive obstructive pulmonary disease.
2. Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction
and PTCA with stent placement.
3. Chronic lower back pain.
4. Small cell lung cancer.

ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Levoxyl 75 mg po q day.
2. Paxil 30 mg po q day.
3. Enalapril 5 mg po q day.
4. Diazepam 3 mg po q day.
5. Zocor 40 mg po q day.
6. Trazodone 50 mg po q day.
7. Roxicet one teaspoon prn.
8. Megace 400 mg po q day.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 96.9, blood pressure
of 86/palp, heart rate in the 90s, respiratory rate 16,
sating well on room air.  In general, she is a thin female in
bed.  HEENT:  Oropharynx is clear.  Neck is supple.
Cardiovascular:  Sinus tachycardia, faint S1, S2.  Lungs:
Coarse breath sounds, otherwise clear.  Abdomen is soft with
mild tenderness.  Extremities:  No lower extremity edema.

LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count of
10.6, hematocrit of 38.1, platelets of 310.  Sodium of 132,
potassium of 4.6, chloride 96, CO2 22, BUN of 27, creatinine
1.1.  Glucose 142, INR of 1.4.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:  The patient was transferred to
the CCU from OMED for elective pericardial centesis.  A
pericardial centesis was performed by under normal
procedures, which removed immediately 600 mL of
serosanguinous fluid followed by an additional 4-500 cc over
the next 48 hours.

The pericardial drain was left in place until drainage was
less than 100 cc per day.  It was removed, and the patient
was transferred to the Medicine Service in good condition.
The patient's symptoms improved markedly with drainage of
pericardial effusion.  She remained in chronic asymptomatic
tachycardia, however, even after drainage of the effusion.

Oncology:  Patient and family decided at this time they did
not wish to undergo further chemotherapy and that she would
be made DNR/DNI, and brought home as a bridge to hospice.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Small cell lung cancer.
2. Pericardial effusion.
3. Pericardial tamponade.
4. Coronary artery disease.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Diazepam 1 mg po q day.
2. Vitamin D 400 units po q day.
3. Calcium carbonate 500 mg po tid.
4. Prednisone 5 mg po q day.
5. Senna two tablets po q hs.
6. Docusate 100 mg po bid.
7. Lactulose 30 mg po q6 prn.
8. Protonix 40 mg po q day.
9. Aspirin 81 mg po q day.
10. Percocet 1-2 tablets q4-6h prn.
11. Trazodone 50 mg po q hs.
12. Simvastatin 40 mg po q day.
13. Peroxitine 30 mg po q day.
14. Levothyroxine 75 mcg po q day.

DISPOSITION:  She was discharged in stable condition to home.
