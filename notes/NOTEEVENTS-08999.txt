History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 81 yr old who presents to [**Hospital1 83**] as transfer 
from OSH for intracerebral bleed. History from daghter as pt. 
incoherent. At baseline, the patient is mildly dememented and 
forgetful, but was functional enough to
take care of herself and be independent. Then, this past Friday 
her daughter noticed that she became very incoherent with her 
speech and was non-sensical.  She also became fatigued and 
eventually bedbound over the next three days. The patient was 
taken to OSH which showed a well circumscribed 20-30cc 
intracerebral hemorrhage in the left frontal lobe located 
subcortically.  No midline shift or edema. There is also 
encephalomalacia of right fronto-parietal lobe suggestive of

NCHCT ([**6-25**])
Large intraparenchymal hemorrhage (32 x 44 mm) with edema or 
encephalomacia in the left frontal lobe. Large areas of 
hypodensity in the right frontal and parietal lobes, with areas 
of encephalomalacia. Possible left petrous meningioma

NCHCT ([**6-28**])
Unchanged
 
Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Neuro ICU for management of intracranial 
hemorrhage.  Neuro exam at that time was significant for waxing 
and [**Doctor Last Name 36**] alertness, inattention and nonsensical speech. There 
is more spontaneous movement on L> R. No cranial nerve findings. 
     

1.  Neuro:  Left frontal ICH (likely secondary to amyloid 
angiopathy)
Antiplatelet agents were held.  Her blood pressure was 
controlled on outpatient regimen (Coreg). Rpt head CT showed 
bleed unchanged. She was transfered to the floor on [**6-28**].  Neuro 
exam remained stable (fluctuating arousal, inattention, 
disorientation, follows simple commands, strength normal).  
Though the etiology of the bleed is likley to be amyloid 
angiopathy, she could have an MRI/MRA with gado as an outpatient 
to exclude other possible causes (mass lesion, AVM)-though these 
seem unlikely and to confirm susceptibility changes on MR that 
would be c/w amyloid.   

2.  CV: 
Continued on antihypertensives, BP well controlled. Lasix and 
aldactone were held secondary to dehydration.  Ruled out for MI 
with 3 sets negative CE.

3. Pulm:
No active pulmonary issues

4.  ID: WBC increased, low grade temp 100.6 on [**7-2**].  Repeat CXR 
negative.  UA showed 8 WBCS, awaiting Urine Culture.  She was 
started on amoxicillin and clarithromycin on [**6-27**] for recently 
diagnosed (and untreated) H. pylori infection.  She should 
continue on antibiotics until [**7-16**].  

5. Nutrition:  Speech and Swallow suggested nectar thick liquids

6. GI:  COntinued on Protonix.  + constipation, KUB negative for 
obstruction.  Started on colace and senna, lactulose PRN for 
constipation.

6. PT/OT:
d/c to rehab for further management

7. DVT Ppx:
pneumoboots

      Large intraparenchymal hemorrhage in left frontal lobe with edema and mass
      effect. Large area of right posterior frontoparieto hypodensities, possibly
      prior infarct.

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     @@@@@@@@@@@@@@ This is a revision of a previously signed report @@@@@@@@@@@@@@

     INDICATIONS:  81-year-old woman with left intracranial hemorrhage and change
     in mental status.
     
     COMPARISONS:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
     
     Films were available from an outside hospital reportedly demonstrating a large
     intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left frontal lobe with edema and mass
     effect along with low density in the right parietal lobe. The prior images are
     not currently available for review at the time of examining the new study.
     There is an intraparenchymal hemorrhage of approximately 32 x 44 mm in axial
     dimensions centered in the white matter of the left frontal lobe with
     surrounding low density. There is some effacement of gyri but surprisingly
     little mass effect on the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 234**]. There is also a very slight
     rightward falcine shift and partial effacement of the left suprasellar
     cistern.  In addition, there is a large area of hypodensity involving the
     right frontoparietal lobe with encephalomalacia in the right sylvian fissure
     without mass effect or edema. These abnormalities extend to the [**Doctor Last Name 30**] matter
     and may represent prior infarction.  Encephalomalacia in the right sylvian
     fissure is likely old.  The more superior areas of hypodensity are age
     indeterminant, but may not be acute and clinical correlation is suggested.
     Outside the area of the large intraparenchymal hemorrhage, the [**Doctor Last Name 30**]-white
     matter distinction is fairly well preserved and no other evidence of
     hemorrhage is seen.
     
     The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
     There is an 8 mm. calcification adjacent to the left petrous bone posterior
     to the internal auditory canal possibly representing a calcified meningioma.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Large intraparenchymal hemorrhage with edema or encephalomacia in
     the left frontal lobe.  Large areas of hypodensity in the right frontal and
     parietal lobes, with areas of encephalomalacia. Possible left petrous
     meningioma. The case was discussed with neurosurgery.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     HISTORY:  Fever, rule out pneumonia.
     
     PA and lateral views of the chest show no significant interval change in the
     radiographic appearance of the chest compared to [**3483-6-26**].  Cardiomegaly
     without edema is noted and the lungs are clear with no pneumonia or nodule
     seen.  Osteopenia and vascular calcifications are identified and flattened
     hemidiaphragms with a prominent AP diameter of the chest on the lateral view
     suggest underlying COPD.
     
     CONCLUSION:  No pneumonia.  No suspicious change compared to one week ago.
