                                     FINAL REPORT
     STUDY:  PA and lateral chest radiograph performed on [**3460-10-18**].
     
     HISTORY:  51-year-old man with chest pain, adenopathy, and history of HIV. The
     patient now with fever and chest pain.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to prior chest radiograph report from [**3458-3-22**].  The actual images are not available at this time and are being
     retrieved.
     
     There is an opacity in the left upper lobe posteriorly, which abuts the
     pleural margin.  There is also a vague opacity abutting the right heart border
     at the right base, which also may represent a second infiltrate.  The cardiac
     silhouette and mediastinum are unremarkable.  The lungs are clear.
     
     IMPRESSION:  
     
     1.  There is an infiltrate within the left upper lobe posteriorly, which abuts
     the posterior pleural margin, findings suspicious for pneumonia.
     
     2.  There is a vague opacity in the right base abutting the right heart
     border, which may represent a second infiltrate.
     
     These findings have been discussed with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 10616**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11462**], PA.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3471**] 
Chief Complaint:
hypotension
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
R internal jugular central line
 
History of Present Illness:
51 yo male with AIDs (dx 1990, on HAART, VL undetectable, CD4 90 
[**12-24**], h/o thrush and esophagitis) admitted with back pain/flank 
pain and fevers. He was in hus USOH until [**3461-1-17**] when he went 
to his PCP's with R sided pleurtic chest pain. He also had a 
resurangence of fevers to 102 - 105 and night sweats which he 
had had for 13 years, then stopped 2 years prior when he started 
HAART. CXR on [**3461-1-17**] showed infiltrate within the left upper 
lobe and an opacityl at the right heart border. He was started 
on Levaquin at that time. Then on [**3461-1-24**], he went to BID 
[**Location (un) 579**] with L calf pain. He was admitted with a DVT and 
multiple PEs. Chest CT at that time also showed multiple 
bilateral segments and subsegmental pulmonary emboli, 
consolidation vs. infarct in the posterior left upper lobe and 
anterior right lower lobe, multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, 
and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. MDs there were also concerned 
that he could have TB as he had weight loss, fevers, and pulm 
nodules. He underwent bronch on [**3461-1-28**] which was ""normal"". 
Cytology showedd atypical flora. Cultures/labs from there showed 
negative crypto ag, oral flora from the bronch, AFB smear 
negative, culture pending. He was started on coumadin and 
heparin and a second of levofloxacin. During this stay, he had 
no pulmonary symptoms.  
.  
On discharge from [**Location (un) 579**], he noticed his Right leg now was 
tender, where it had not been before. He then was switched to a 
course of Doxy on [**2-1**] my his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was not doing well at home 
since he was having extreem pain in both his legs. The swelling 
in the LLE diminished, but the right increased. He had no 
pulmonary symptoms until the afternoon on [**2-8**] when he began to 
become SOB. He came to the ED.  
.  
In ED, initial vitals were 103.6, HR 145, BP 78/62, RR 18, 98% 
-> 100% on 2L .He was complaiing of worsening SOB and pleurtic 
right chest pain. Code sepsis called, RIJ placed. Initial CVP 
was 7. he was boluesd 8 L NS in the ED. Of note, his O2 sat on 
arrival was 98% RA, then 100% 2l in the ED,94% on 4L NC on 
arrival to MICU. he was started on Dopamine and levophed. He was 
given 1 gram of vancomycin, 1 gram of CTX, and a DS bactrim. 
Blood cultures and urine cultures were sent. A ct chest revealed 
a left upper lobe opacity, subsegmental PE's, multiple B pulm 
nodules.  
.  
Currently, he is SOB and c/o pleurtic right sided and posterior 
chest pain and bilateral calf pain. He has been having fevers to 
102 - 105 daily with night sweats. Denies large weight gain (he 
has had touble with weight loss since his MAC). No HA. No neck 
pain. No nausea. No vomiting. Has one loose BM daily [**2-21**] HAART. 
Denies missing any of his medicine. Quit smoking 2 eeks agi. No 
recent PPD. No TB contacts. No Rashes. No recent travel.

Extremities: 1+ pitting edema bilaterally on calf. VERY tender 
gastroc. 2+ radial, DP and PT pulses b/l.  
Neurologic: A and O x3; srength grossly normal.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: 51 yo m with AIDS, recent diagnosis of PE, pulmonary 
nodules, fevers, and shock. His shock is most likely due to 
sepsis given his increasing WBC and low CVP making right heart 
strain from PE unlikley.  
.  
Plan:  
# Septic shock: He seems to be in distributive shock. Most 
likely this is sepsis, given that he is immunocompromised with 
fevers and respiratory distress. However,  Adrenal insufficiency 
unlikely given normal [**Last Name (un) **] stim test. Given his 
immunocomprimised state, he has many potential sources for 
sepsis including bactreial, fungal, and viral. Infectious 
disease was consulted who recommended continue treatment with 
caspofungin, azithromycin, imipenem-cilastin. Continue 
antiretrovirals and bactrim ppx.  Unclear source at this point. 
So far all cultures NGTD, cryptococcus, CMV, and histo 
serologies negative, AFB x3, PCP stain, [**Name9 (PRE) 12407**] ag, negative.  Pt 
was placed on Sepsis protocol. With frequent NS fluid bolus for 
CVP >12 and pressors.  He had episode of NSVT on arrival while 
on dopamine and was changed over to levophed, which he required 
for several days of his addmision to keep MAP>65. Given 
persistent hypotension concern for neurogenic shock secondary to 
autonomic dysfunction, Neuro consult was obtained who did not 
think that patient has autonomic dysfunction on initial 
assessement.
.  
#  Respiratory distress - as above, most likely secondary to 
pulmonary infection complicated by pulmonary emboli. Required 
significant oxygen supplementation initially but this was 
reduced by 6 days of hospitalization from NRB to 40% by 
facemask.
.
# PE/DVT: Hx of DVT and PE on recent hospitalization.  RL LENI 
shows DVT this admission.  Given likely coumadin failure IVC 
filter was placed.  Pt was started on heparin initially and then 
changed over to lovenox 1mcg/kg bid.  [**2-17**] AM with RUE swelling 
as well, with DVT.  Heme onc consulted, started on heparin as 
developing DVTs through lovenox.
- Given recurrent dvt and ?pulmonary nodules and enlarged 
lymphnode concern for malignancy in setting of hypercoguble 
state high.  
- Currently morphine prn.
.
#. hemoptysis - likely secondary to underlying pulmonary 
processes. Consider bronchoscopy only if this worsens (currently 
stable).
.
#Polyuria - Unclear etiology. Continues to urinate to the point 
of hypotension despite IVF being stopped. May have neprogenic DI 
[**2-21**] ambisome. May also not be able to concentrate urine to 
excrete all the salt he has gotten on the sepsis portocol 
causing an solute diuresis. Gave dose of ddAVP to see if can 
concentrate urine. Ambisome switched to caspofungin. 
- Renal was consulted given concern for DI.  They did not think 
that the pt has diabetes insipidus given that the patient has 
had normal Uosm and Una. More likely, this is consistent with a 
solute diuresis from the large amounts of fluid the patient has 
received during this hospitalization. It is unclear whether he 
is intravascularly depleted or overloaded, and his weight is up 
approx 6kg. If he is making appropriate urine to previous IVF 
administration, would expect his urine now to more accurately 
match his input.  With restriction on NS IVF, pt's urine output 
has improved.
.
# Infection - unclear etiology most likely source of infectionis 
pulmonary, but differential in this immunocompromised patient is 
very broad. ID following. So far all cultures NGTD, 
cryptococcus, CMV, and histo serologies negative
- on retrovirals, azithro/bactrim
- imipenem dc'd- continuing with vanco
.
## Neuro - pt with c/o diplopia this morning which is new.  Also 
with nystagmus on exam concerning for brainstem process.
- per discussion with neuro attg, given pt's likely 
hypercoaguble state need to rule out stroke.
- MRI/MRA -small L cerebellar stroke, w/ sluggish basilar artery 
flow, CTA also showed no thrombus but decreased basilar artery 
flow.  Per Neuro ordered TTE w/ bubble, no ASD or PFO
- Daily CT showed no change (needs daily CTx7 day to assess no 
hemorrhagic development
.
#Hemoptysis - likel secodary to PE and PNA. Stable in amount and 
frequency. Is small amounts at this time. If decompensates of 
hemoptysis progresses beyond tsp amounts will need bronchoscopy 
and possible surgical consult.   
.
## Neuro - pt with c/o diplopia this morning which is new.  Also 
with nystagmus on exam concerning for brainstem process.
- per discussion with neuro attg, given pt's likely 
hypercoaguble state need to rule out stroke.
- MRI/MRA to eval for stroke.
.
# AIDS: Initially held  HAART therapy. Restarted on [**3460-2-15**].  

#. pulm nodules - concern for malignancy given fevers, LAD. o/w 
infection as above. with LUL mass, discuss timing of biopsy as 
differential includes lymphoma vs lung neoplasm, will need to 
discuss holding anticoagulation.
.
PPx: PPI, no pneumoboots, lovenox, increase bowel regimen given 
constipation, no bowel movement since admission per pt
FEN: po diet as resp status stable
Access: RIJ, R art line, PIV
Communication: sister [**Name (NI) **]
Dispo: ICU until HD stable
# Code Status: Full, discussed extensively with paitent and HCP, 
[**Doctor First Name **], his sister. He is very nervous about intubation, but 
agrees that he may benefit from it in the short term.  
# Dispo: ICU for now given hypotension.
# Contact: [**Doctor First Name **], sister  ...

The patient had a prolonged intensive care unit stay.  He 
developed further progressive thromboses.  An IVC filter was 
placed to prevent further pulmonary emboli.  He developed 
ischemic bowel with thrombosis of celiac and mesenteric 
arteries.  After extensive discussion with patient and his 
sister [**Name (NI) **], the patient was made care and comfort measures 
only.  He was treated with IV morphine and expired peacefully on 
[**3461-3-6**].

     STUDY:  AP chest performed on [**3461-2-9**].
     
     HISTORY:  51-year-old man with AIDS, hypoxia, and pulmonary emboli.  Evaluate
     for fluid overload or larger pulmonary infarct.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous study from [**3461-2-9**].
     
     There has been worsening of the diffuse airspace opacities throughout both
     lung fields.  These opacities are seen predominantly within the right lower
     lobe, left upper lobe, and left lower lobe.  There is also a new left
     retrocardiac opacity.  There is a right-sided central venous catheter with the
     distal tip in the mid SVC.  There is blunting of bilateral CP angles
     consistent with small pleural effusions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Worsening of the airspace opacities seen throughout both lung fields. This
     may represent worsening of the pulmonary infarcts with pulmonary hemorrhage.
     However, a component of pulmonary edema would be difficult to exclude.
     
     2.  New small bilateral pleural effusions.

     INDICATION:  51-year-old with history of HIV and known pneumonia.
     
     SINGLE AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST:  Compared to chest CTA performed
     subsequently.  Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
     unremarkable.  There is consolidation in the left upper lobe and a more subtle
     opacity in the right lower lobe.  Innumerable small pulmonary nodules known
     from subsequent chest CT are not well evaluated here.  There is emphysematous
     changes of the upper lobe.  Known mediastinal lymphadenopathy is also not well
     seen on this chest x-ray.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Left upper lobe consolidation.
     2) Right lower lobe opacity, correlation with the subsequent chest CTA
     suggests this likely represents infarction/hemorrhage due to known PEs in this
     distribution.
     3) Multiple tiny pulmonary nodules seen on the chest CT are not well seen on

                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     STUDY:  AP chest performed on [**3461-2-9**].
     
     HISTORY:  51-year-old man with AIDS, hypoxia, and pulmonary emboli.  Evaluate
     for fluid overload or larger pulmonary infarct.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous study from [**3461-2-9**].
     
     There has been worsening of the diffuse airspace opacities throughout both
     lung fields.  These opacities are seen predominantly within the right lower
     lobe, left upper lobe, and left lower lobe.  There is also a new left
     retrocardiac opacity.  There is a right-sided central venous catheter with the
     distal tip in the mid SVC.  There is blunting of bilateral CP angles
     consistent with small pleural effusions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Worsening of the airspace opacities seen throughout both lung fields. This
     may represent worsening of the pulmonary infarcts with pulmonary hemorrhage.
     However, a component of pulmonary edema would be difficult to exclude.
     
     2.  New small bilateral pleural effusions.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  51-year-old with HIV with no pneumonia, rule out PE.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Apparently, there is a prior CT chest from an outside hospital,
     which is not available to me at the time of interpretation.
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT imaging through the chest with IV contrast by CPAP
     protocol, with coronal and sagittal reformatted images.
     
     CTA CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are multiple occlusive pulmonary emboli
     involving the subsegmental branches of the right lower lobe.  The central
     pulmonary arterial system is patent.  There is dense consolidation involving
     the posterior aspect of the left upper lobe and ground glass and alveolar
     consolidation involving the right lung base posteriorly.  Additionally, there
     are innumerable small pulmonary nodules ranging from 3-7mm throughout both
     lungs, highly concerning for malignancy.  Diffuse emphysematous changes.
     Diffuse lymphadenopathy in the upper mediastinum, predominantly in the AP
     window distribution.  The heart and pericardium are unremarkable.  Limited
     axial imaging through the upper abdomen demonstrates no obvious abnormalities.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are seen.
     
     MULTIPLANAR REFORMATS:  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images confirm the
     above findings.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Multiple occlusive subsegmental pulmonary emboli in the branches of the
     right lower lobe. Associated RLL opacity likely represents
     infarction/hemorrhage.
     2) Dense consolidation in the left upper lobe, likely pneumonia, but worisome
     in that it has been present dating back to [**12-24**] It should be followed to
     resolution.

     HISTORY:  AIDS, hypoxia, sepsis and pulmonary embolism.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**2-9**]:
     
     Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the left and small on the right have
     developed since [**2-9**] accompanied by asymmetric pulmonary edema,
     obscuring the previously more discrete consolidation in the left upper and
     right lower lung zones.  Heart is normal size.  Nodular opacities seen on the
     chest CTA from [**2-9**], particularly at the right lung base have not been
     apparent on plain radiographs.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  51-year-old man with AIDS and pulmonary embolism while on Coumadin
     with bilateral lower extremity DVTs.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 3134**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 42**], the Attending Radiologist,
     present and supervising the entire procedure.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 389**] reviewed the exam.
     
     PROCEDURE: Ultrasound examination of the common femoral veins bilaterally was
     performed and demonstrated chronic occlusive thrombosis of the right common
     femoral vein and acute partially occlusive thrombus within the left common
     femoral vein. The decision was made to use the left common femoral vein for
     access.  The left groin was prepped and draped sterilely.  Preprocedure
     timeout was performed.  1% lidocaine was used to administer local anesthesia.
     21-gauge needle was advanced into the left common femoral vein under
     ultrasound guidance.  The ultrasound image was printed and attached to the
     chart documenting vessel patency.  The 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 223**] wire was advanced via the
     needle into the IVC and the needle was exchanged for a multi side hole pigtail
     flush catheter which was positioned at the convergence of the iliac veins into
     the IVC.  The wire was removed and catheter was connected to the power
     injector. An IVC venogram was then performed demonstrating non-duplicated,
     single, patent IVC with patent proximal iliac veins.  The position of the
     renal veins was established. The renal veins appeared patent.  0.035 guidewire
     was then advanced into the catheter and the catheter was exchanged for an IVC
     filter sheath which was positioned slightly above the level of the lowermost
     left renal vein.  The filter was deployed just below the level of the left
     renal vein and a final fluoroscopic image was obtained.  The sheath was
     removed and pressure was applied until complete hemostasis in the left groin
     was achieved. The patient was transported to the room in good condition.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a VenaTech IVC filter in the infrarenal
     position.

     MRI OF THE BRAIN AND MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]
     
     INDICATION:  51-year-old man with pulmonary emboli failed on warfarin,
     hypotensive, new diplopia and nystagmus.  Evaluate for stroke and basilar
     artery abnormality.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images of the brain were obtained.
     Diffusion-weighted scans are included.
     
     3D time-of-flight MR angiography of the circle of [**Location (un) 220**] was performed.
     Multiplanar reformatted images and source image data are reviewed.
     
     Comparison is made to a previous MRI of the brain from [**3457-8-18**].
     
     FINDINGS:
     In the interval since the previous study, there are several small cerebellar
     infarctions which have developed, the largest of which is in the
     posterolateral inferior right cerebellar hemisphere.  In addition, there is a
     new focus of left anteromedial inferior cerebellar signal abnormality and
     diffusion hyperintensity, suspicious for acute infarction.
     
     Cerebral structures appear normal.  The ventricles are not dilated.  There are
     three or four small foci of increased T2 signal in the subcortical white
     matter of the cerebral hemispheres, which probably represent chronic
     microvascular infarctions.  There is no abnormal intracranial susceptibility
     artifact.
     
     MR angiographic images demonstrate flow in the major branches of the anterior
     circulation, with prominent posterior communicating arteries continuing into
     the posterior cerebral arteries bilaterally.  There is also normal-appearing
     flow signal within both intracranial vertebral arteries, however, the basilar
     artery flow signal is diminished and irregular.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  MRI demonstrates a small acute left anterior cerebellar infarction.  Other
     small chronic infarctions of the cerebellum are identified and have occurred
     in the interval since the previous study.
     
     2.  MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 220**] demonstrates abnormally decreased flow in the
     basilar artery.  Vertebral artery flow signal and posterior communicating
                                                                 (Over)

     three or four small foci of increased T2 signal in the subcortical white
     matter of the cerebral hemispheres, which probably represent chronic
     microvascular infarctions.  There is no abnormal intracranial susceptibility
     artifact.
     
     MR angiographic images demonstrate flow in the major branches of the anterior
     circulation, with prominent posterior communicating arteries continuing into
     the posterior cerebral arteries bilaterally.  There is also normal-appearing
     flow signal within both intracranial vertebral arteries, however, the basilar
     artery flow signal is diminished and irregular.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  MRI demonstrates a small acute left anterior cerebellar infarction.  Other
     small chronic infarctions of the cerebellum are identified and have occurred
     in the interval since the previous study.
     
     2.  MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 220**] demonstrates abnormally decreased flow in the
     basilar artery.  Vertebral artery flow signal and posterior communicating

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Cerebellar infarction and decreased basilar artery flow on MRA.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast CT of the head was performed, followed by a CT
     arteriogram of the Circle of [**Location (un) 220**].  Additional multiplanar reformatted
     images as well as volume-rendered images were also performed and reviewed.
     
     COMPARISONS:  None.  Correlation is made with yesterday's MRA.
     
     FINDINGS:  Noncontrast evaluation of the brain remains within normal limits,
     and demonstrates no evidence of hemorrhage, major territorial infarction, or
     shift of normally midline structures.  Extraaxial spaces are slightly dilated,
     considering the patient's age.  The [**Doctor Last Name 30**]-white matter differentiation appears
     preserved. The left cerebellar infarction seen on the prior MRI is not evident
     on this examination.
     
     CTA:  The basilar artery has a clearly patent although moderately irregularly
     narrowed caliber.   Both vertebral arteries remain prominent and well
     distended, even in the presence of persistent bilateral fetal posterior
     cerebral circulations. The remainder of the major vascular tributaries of the
     Circle of [**Location (un) 220**] appeared normal.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  There is a diffusely narrow basilar artery, in the presence of both
     bilateral persistent fetal posterior cerebral circulation as well as prominent
     bilateral vertebral arteries.  While this might be atherosclerotic in nature
     or a congenital variant, vasculitis should also be considered, especially in
     this patient with AIDS.
     
     2.  Prominence of extraaxial spaces, which may be AIDS-related change.

     INDICATION:  Lung nodules, question malignancy.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were
     obtained with oral and intravenous contrast.  150 cc of Optiray contrast were
     administered.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3461-2-9**] chest CTA.
     
     CHEST CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a thrombus within the right internal
     jugular vein and right brachiocephalic vein.  The left brachiocephalic vein
     and left internal jugular vein are patent.  No thrombus is seen within the
     superior vena cava.  No axillary lymphadenopathy is present.  There are
     multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, with two lymph nodes immediately
     below the aortic arch measuring 1.8 x 1.5 cm and 1.3 x 2.2 cm. There is an ill
     defined irregular mass in the left suprahilar region, which is causing
     compression of the upper lobe vessels as well as compression of the apical and
     posterior left upper lobe segmental bronchi.  Persistent consolidation is seen
     in the left upper lobe superiorly and posteriorly and is unchanged from the
     prior study.
     
     There are innumerable bilateral pulmonary nodules, which do not appear
     significantly changed from the prior study.  There is moderate-sized right
     effusion and a small left effusion, both of which have increased in size in
     comparison to the prior study.  The right lower lobe is collapsed and there
     are irregular heterogeneous low-attenuation foci within the collapsed lobe,
     likely due to metastatic foci.  There are patchy inspissated secretions in the
     right lower lobe branches.
     
     ABDOMEN CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  An 8 mm x 8 mm low-attenuation focus is present
     within the posterior right lobe of the liver, immediately adjacent to the IVC.
       The gallbladder, pancreas, and adrenal glands are unremarkable.  Two low-
     attenuation foci are present within the spleen.  These are not fully
     characterized on this study.  The largest measures 1.4 cm in diameter.  The
     kidneys are normal.  Scattered small paraaortic lymph nodes are present, none
     of which meet criteria for pathologic enlargement.  The stomach, small bowel,
     and large bowel are normal.  There is an inferior vena cava filter, with tip
     at the level of the renal vein insertions.
     
     PELVIS CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  The distal ureters, rectum, and pelvic loops of
                                                                 (Over)

     bowel are unremarkable.  There is a Foley within the bladder.  A small amount
     of free fluid is present within the pelvis consistent with mild ascites.
     Bilateral femoral vein thrombi are present.
     
     The osseous structures reveal no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
     Diffuse mild increased attenuation is seen within the subcutaneous fat,
     consistent with diffuse edema.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Left suprahilar mass with post obstructive consolidation.  This is highly
     concerning for a primary lung malignancy.  This is likely amenable to
     bronchoscopic biopsy.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Lung nodules, question malignancy.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were
     obtained with oral and intravenous contrast.  150 cc of Optiray contrast were
     administered.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3461-2-9**] chest CTA.
     
     CHEST CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a thrombus within the right internal
     jugular vein and right brachiocephalic vein.  The left brachiocephalic vein
     and left internal jugular vein are patent.  No thrombus is seen within the
     superior vena cava.  No axillary lymphadenopathy is present.  There are
     multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, with two lymph nodes immediately
     below the aortic arch measuring 1.8 x 1.5 cm and 1.3 x 2.2 cm. There is an ill
     defined irregular mass in the left suprahilar region, which is causing
     compression of the upper lobe vessels as well as compression of the apical and
     posterior left upper lobe segmental bronchi.  Persistent consolidation is seen
     in the left upper lobe superiorly and posteriorly and is unchanged from the
     prior study.
     
     There are innumerable bilateral pulmonary nodules, which do not appear
     significantly changed from the prior study.  There is moderate-sized right
     effusion and a small left effusion, both of which have increased in size in
     comparison to the prior study.  The right lower lobe is collapsed and there
     are irregular heterogeneous low-attenuation foci within the collapsed lobe,
     likely due to metastatic foci.  There are patchy inspissated secretions in the
     right lower lobe branches.
     
     ABDOMEN CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  An 8 mm x 8 mm low-attenuation focus is present
     within the posterior right lobe of the liver, immediately adjacent to the IVC.
       The gallbladder, pancreas, and adrenal glands are unremarkable.  Two low-
     attenuation foci are present within the spleen.  These are not fully
     characterized on this study.  The largest measures 1.4 cm in diameter.  The
     kidneys are normal.  Scattered small paraaortic lymph nodes are present, none
     of which meet criteria for pathologic enlargement.  The stomach, small bowel,
     and large bowel are normal.  There is an inferior vena cava filter, with tip
     at the level of the renal vein insertions.

     transformation.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast CT of the head was performed, compared to yesterday's
     CT.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline
     structures.  Extra-axial spaces appear somewhat prominent for the patient's
     age.  The focus of infarction seen on the prior MRI again is not seen on this
     examination in the left cerebellum.  The [**Doctor Last Name 30**]-white matter differentiation
     remains preserved.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are within normal
     limits, aside from a large left nasal septal spur.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No appreciable interval change or evidence of hemorrhagic
     transformation in comparison to either the CT of the head performed yesterday
     or the examination performed the day before.

     COMPARISON:  [**3461-2-18**].
     
     UPRIGHT AP CHEST:  This exam was performed at the bedside.  The right internal
     jugular central venous catheter has been removed in the interim since the
     prior exam.  Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are unchanged.  Moderate
     sized right pleural effusion is unchanged.  No significant left pleural
     effusion.  Opacity within the left upper lobe has become slightly more
     confluent in the interim, suggesting pneumonia.  Asymmetric pulmonary edema is
     lower on the differential diagnosis, especially given the patient's symptoms.
     The right upper lung is clear.  No pneumothorax.  Osseous structures are
     unchanged.  An inferior vena cava filter is noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Left upper lobe opacity has become more confluent, consistent with
     pneumonia.  Continued followup is recommended to ensure resolution.
     2.  Persistent moderate right pleural effusion.

     AP single view of the chest has been obtained with the patient in semi-upright
     position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with a similar preceding
     study of [**3461-2-21**].  The previously described right-sided basal density
     obliterating the right diaphragmatic contour and blunting the pleural sinus
     remains rather unchanged.  No new parenchymal abnormalities can be identified.
     Also the left upper lobe parenchymal densities are again seen, and may even
     have increased slightly in extension.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax in
     the apical region on either side.  The noninvolved pulmonary areas do not show
     any vascular congestive pattern, nor is there evidence of cardiac enlargement.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Persistent right-sided pleural density, left upper lung field
     densities with slight progression.  Further evaluation recommended.

     FINDINGS:
     
     There are additional acute cerebellar infarcts superimposed upon the infarcts

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  51-year-old man with AIDS, recent diagnosis of lung cancer, status
     post first round of chemotherapy, multiple PEs and DVTs, now on Coumadin with
     acute onset epigastric and periumbilical pain.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3461-2-19**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Mesenteric CTA of the abdomen and pelvis was performed, consisting
     of a non-contrast sequence followed by an arterial phase and delayed phase
     imaging.  Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained.
     
     CT ABDOMEN:  There are numerous pulmonary nodules at the lung bases.  They are
     likely not significantly changed compared to the recent torso CT, but are more
     apparent due to the decrease in size of pleural effusions.  Filling defects
     are observed in the subsegmental right lower lobe pulmonary arteries
     consistent with pulmonary emboli.  There is a small right pleural effusion,
     which is decreased compared to recent examination.  The left pleural effusion
     has resolved.  The liver, gallbladder, and pancreas are unremarkable.  There
     has been interval development of perfusion defects involving most of the
     spleen consistent with infarction.  The kidneys are overall stable in
     appearance.  There are tiny bilateral low-attenuation foci, which may
     represent cysts, but are too small to be fully characterized.  Small wedge-
     shaped perfusion defects in the right kidney are consistent with prior
     infarcts.  Within the limits of this noncontrast study, the bowel loops are
     fluid filled and slightly hyperenhancing.  No definite wall thickening or
     pneumatosis is identified.  There is a tiny amount of free air along the
     infrainguinal, linea [**Female First Name (un) 11493**].  No significant free fluid is identified.
     
     There is mild narrowing at the origin of the celiac axis, but it is patent.
     The superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric arteries appear occluded at
     their origins.  Although, the CT of [**3461-2-19**] was not optimized for
     arterial evaluation, these findings appear to have been present on that exam.
     There is reconstitution of the superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric
     territories.  An IVC filter is again observed.  There is a small amount of
     thrombus captured within the filter.  Thrombus is observed in both common
     femoral veins.
     
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     (Cont)
     CT PELVIS:  The bladder is unremarkable.  Calcifications are again noted in
     the prostate.  The sigmoid colon and rectum are unremarkable.  There is no
     free fluid and no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Tiny amount of intraperitoneal free air.  In the absence of recent
     intraabdominal intervention, this finding is concerning for bowel perforation.
     Within the limits of this study, no definite bowel abnormalities are
     identified other than slight hyperenhancement.  No wall thickening,
     pneumatosis or free fluid is identified.  However, the presence of superior
     mesenteric and inferior mesenteric artery occlusion places this patient at
     risk for mesenteric ischemia.  Close clinical follow up is recommended.
     
     2.  Interval infarction of the majority of the spleen.  The visualized splenic
     artery is patent, suggesting an embolic phenomenon.
     
     3.  Right lower lobe subsegmental pulmonary embolism.  Small amount of
     thrombus captured within the IVC filter.  Bilateral common femoral vein
     thrombus.
     
     4.  Multiple pulmonary nodules at the lung bases.
     
     5.  Slight decrease in size of right pleural effusion.  Interval resolution of
     left pleural effusion.
     
     6.  Small wedge-shaped perfusion defects in the right kidney suggestive of
     prior infarcts.

     INDICATION:  HIV/AIDS, recent diagnosis of lung cancer, multiple DVTs, now
     with worsening abdominal pain.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Mesenteric CTA technique was used, along with delayed abdomen and
     pelvis images.  Pre-contrast images were also obtained of the abdomen and
     pelvis.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.  200 cc of
     Optiray contrast were administered.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3461-3-3**] abdomen and pelvis CT.
     
     MESENTERIC CTA:  Occlusion of the celiac trunk and superior mesenteric root
     are noted.  Occlusion of the celiac trunk is new from the prior study.  There
     is partial reconstitution of flow within the hepatic artery and a diminutive
     splenic artery.  Partial reconstitution is also seen within a diminutive
     superior mesenteric artery.  There is normal contrast opacification of the
     right and left renal arteries.
     
     Delayed phase imaging reveals bilateral femoral DVTs and right iliac vein DVT.
     No opacification is seen within the superior mesenteric vein.  Small caliber
     opacified splenic vein and partially opacified small caliber portal vein are
     present.  Thrombi are seen within several posterior right lower lobe pulmonary
     arterial branches.
     
     ABDOMEN CT WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  Right lower lobe effusion is present
     and there are multiple nodular opacities at the right lung base.  Right lower
     lobe atelectasis is seen.  There is markedly abnormal liver attenuation with
     hypoperfusion, which is new from the prior study.  Given the significant
     vascular abnormalities as described above, this is concerning for evolving
     infarcts. The pancreas is unremarkable.  The spleen is diffusely low
     attenuation with minimal enhancement consistent with near total infarction.
     Normal enhancement of the left kidney is seen.  A 1.5 cm wedge-shaped defect
     is seen in the lower pole of the right kidney, likely consistent with an
     infarct.  There is otherwise normal renal cortical enhancement.  There is no
     hydronephrosis.  The bowel is diffusely abnormal, with moderate-to-severe
     bowel dilatation.  This is new from the prior study.
                                                                 (Over)

     infarct.  There is otherwise normal renal cortical enhancement.  There is no
     hydronephrosis.  The bowel is diffusely abnormal, with moderate-to-severe
     bowel dilatation.  This is new from the prior study.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
       51 year old man with HIV/AIDS, recent dx of lung cancer s/p 1st round chemo,  
      multiple PE/DVT on lovenox now s/p IVC filter w/ worsening abdominal pain    
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      pt w/ multiple dvt/pe and newly infarcted spleen.  previous abd CT w/ small 
      amount of free air but exam fairly benign.  now pt w/ worsening abdominal pain 
      and surgical abdomen.  please eval for acute mesenteric ischemia, perforation, 
      and obstruction
     No contraindications for IV contrast

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  HIV/AIDS, recent diagnosis of lung cancer, multiple DVTs, now
     with worsening abdominal pain.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Mesenteric CTA technique was used, along with delayed abdomen and
     pelvis images.  Pre-contrast images were also obtained of the abdomen and
     pelvis.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.  200 cc of
     Optiray contrast were administered.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3461-3-3**] abdomen and pelvis CT.
     
     MESENTERIC CTA:  Occlusion of the celiac trunk and superior mesenteric root
     are noted.  Occlusion of the celiac trunk is new from the prior study.  There
     is partial reconstitution of flow within the hepatic artery and a diminutive
     splenic artery.  Partial reconstitution is also seen within a diminutive
     superior mesenteric artery.  There is normal contrast opacification of the
     right and left renal arteries.
     
     Delayed phase imaging reveals bilateral femoral DVTs and right iliac vein DVT.
     No opacification is seen within the superior mesenteric vein.  Small caliber
     opacified splenic vein and partially opacified small caliber portal vein are
     present.  Thrombi are seen within several posterior right lower lobe pulmonary
     arterial branches.
     
     ABDOMEN CT WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  Right lower lobe effusion is present
     and there are multiple nodular opacities at the right lung base.  Right lower
     lobe atelectasis is seen.  There is markedly abnormal liver attenuation with
     hypoperfusion, which is new from the prior study.  Given the significant
     vascular abnormalities as described above, this is concerning for evolving
     infarcts. The pancreas is unremarkable.  The spleen is diffusely low
     attenuation with minimal enhancement consistent with near total infarction.
     Normal enhancement of the left kidney is seen.  A 1.5 cm wedge-shaped defect
     is seen in the lower pole of the right kidney, likely consistent with an
     infarct.  There is otherwise normal renal cortical enhancement.  There is no
     hydronephrosis.  The bowel is diffusely abnormal, with moderate-to-severe
     bowel dilatation.  This is new from the prior study.
                                                                 (Over)
