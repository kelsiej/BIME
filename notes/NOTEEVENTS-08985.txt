Admission Date:  [**2980-1-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2980-1-28**]

Date of Birth:   [**2904-11-30**]       Sex:  M


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75 year old
male first admitted to the Neurology Service on [**1-19**],
for a right hemisphere stroke and then transferred to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2980-1-23**] for
lobe pneumonia, sputum culture growing out Escherichia coli
and Pseudomonas.  The patient is status post right
pneumonectomy for lung cancer and has chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease diagnosed in [**2979-4-24**] with
myelodysplastic syndrome, also with new onset atrial
fibrillation.  The patient presented initially with
left-sided weakness and dysarthria which was on magnetic
of ischemic paraventricular white matter on the right.  There
was no thrombosis, no vegetation seen on echocardiogram.
After four days on the Neurology Service with great
improvement in terms of his left-sided weakness the patient
was noted to have decreased oxygen saturation down to the
high 80s with tachypnea, was transferred to the Medicine
Intensive Care Unit for possible intervention.  Along with
the hypoxia and tachypnea he was also noted to have a
lowgrade fever, a cough with yellow sputum, while his chest
x-ray revealed a new left lower lobe infiltrate, Levofloxacin
was started, giving his aspiration risk and sputum culture
grew Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas and antibiotics were
changed to Ceftazidime along with Levofloxacin.  Also of
note, on the same day he developed atrial fibrillation which
was new onset with heart rates of 170s.  The rate was
eventually controlled with Diltiazem and Lopressor.  During
his stay in the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient
became afebrile.  Follow up chest x-ray showed improvement in
the left lower lobe infiltrate and the patient was
transferred to the Medicine Floor.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Coronary artery disease, status
post two myocardial infarctions, the last one in [**2974**]; 2.

scan in [**2979-5-24**] showed an aneurysm 4.8 by 4.8.  6.
Myelodysplastic syndrome; 7.  Macular degeneration; 8.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; 9.  Congestive heart
failure; 10.  Peripheral vascular disease; 11.  Chronic

Care Unit, Sotalol was used for rhythm control with
Cardiology following.  He was originally started on low dose
beta blocker, Lopressor 12.5, b.i.d. and was discontinued due
to worsening wheezing secondary to chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.  His systolic blood pressures rose to the
170s.  Electrocardiograms were performed on [**1-23**], [**1-24**],
and showed no changes.  Aspirin was continued.  Coumadin was
recommended for both his atrial fibrillation and
cerebrovascular accident.  He was originally started on 4 mg
on [**1-22**] and 2, INR rose to 3.6.  The patient is now
currently on Coumadin 2 mg q.h.s.

2.  Pulmonary - The patient was originally requiring 15
liters oxygen mask with saturations in the low 90s.  He is

on Levofloxacin and Ceftazidime.  Levofloxacin is 500 mg
times one every day and Ceftazidime is intravenously q. 8
hours.  There has been amazing improvement in his lung
examination with decreased wheezing and crackles that were
noted originally at the bases.

3.  Renal - His BUN/creatinine has been stable during the
hospitalization.

4.  Infectious disease - Noted sputum grew out Escherichia
coli and Pseudomonas.  The patient was continued with
Levofloxacin for six more days and the intravenous
Ceftazidime for a total of 14 days.
