CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Upper gastrointestinal bleed.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 51 year-old man
with a history of HIV, hepatitis C and cirrhosis who has
noted progressive development of ascites over the two weeks
prior to admission.  He has also noted increasing nausea and
vomiting over the two to three months prior to admission.
Approximately one to two weeks prior to admission the patient
noted epigastric discomfort associated with vomitus with
small amount of blood streaking noted.  The patient was seen
in the Emergency Department at that time where he was noted
to have mild hepatitis, pancreatitis with coagulopathy.  INR
was 2.7 and anemia with a hematocrit of 33.9.  He reports
being diagnosed with ascites at that time and asked to follow
up with his primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] report his primary
care physician instituted diuretic therapy with Aldactone 50
mg po q.d. at that time and held his heart therapy.  On the
morning of admission the patient stated that he felt nauseous
and that he self induced vomiting by ""sticking his fingers
down his throat.""  He reported that the vomitus was somewhat
bloody.  He subsequently developed a rapid heart rate with
palpitations and came to the Emergency Department for further
evaluation.

In the Emergency Department he was noted to be tachycardic
with a heart rate of approximately 110 and a blood pressure
of 96/38 and nasogastric tube was placed, which returned
bright red blood.  He was lavaged with 1200 cc returning 2700
cc of bloody fluid, which did not clear.  The patient was
then resuscitated in the Emergency Department and admitted to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  HIV diagnosed in [**2501**] secondary to
intravenous drug use.  His last CD4 count was 378 on the
[**12-8**].  His last viral load was 23,700.  2.  Chronic
hepatitis C.  3.  Lipodystrophy.  4.  Hypogonadism.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  1.  Aldactone 50 mg po q.d.  2.
Vitamin K 10 mg subQ for the two prior days.  3.  Mycelex.
4. HAART consisting of Ritonavir, Stavudine, Didanosine and
Kaletra, which was held for this period.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married with two children.
He has a prior history of cocaine and heroine use.  He denies
recent ethanol use and has a remote tobacco history.

INITIAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Pulse 110.  Blood pressure
116/60.  Respiratory rate 14.  Oxygen saturation of 100% on
room air.  In general, he is a thin ill appearing man in no
acute distress.  His HEENT examination was unremarkable with
sclera anicteric, oropharynx with nasogastric tube in place.
Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular
movements intact.  He had some temporal wasting.  His neck
was supple with full range of motion.  His lungs were clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac examination he was
noted to be tachycardic.  Normal S1 and S2.  No murmurs, rubs
or gallops were appreciated.  His abdomen was distended with
mild epigastric tenderness.  No right upper quadrant
tenderness.  No rebound or guarding.  His rectal examination
had black guaiac positive stool per the Emergency Department.
On extremity examination he had 1+ pitting edema bilaterally
in the lower extremities.  Dorsalis pedis pulses were 2+.

INITIAL LABORATORY STUDIES:  [**Known patient lastname 383**] blood cell 16.6,
hematocrit 22.9, previously 33.9 on [**2512-3-6**].  Platelets of
84, INR 2.7, PTT 57, sodium 135, potassium 4.9, chloride 100,
bicarb 20, BUN 30, creatinine 1.2, glucose 81, ALT 130, AST
201, alkaline phosphatase 172, total bilirubin 2.2, amylase
246, lipase 194, albumin 1.9.  His electrocardiogram showed
sinus tachycardia at a rate of 100, intervals of 120, 482,
451, nonspecific ST T wave changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit to be stabilized.  ON the first
evening he was transfused a total of six units of packed red
blood cells and also one bag of platelets and five units of
fresh frozen platelets to maintain hemodynamic stability.  He
also underwent emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which
showed duodenal erosion and a tear consistent with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 973**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear leading to his upper gastrointestinal bleed.  He
also underwent paracentesis.  His ascites showed [**Known patient lastname **] blood
cell of 100 with a differential of 0 polys, 20 lymphocytes,
22 monocytes, 2 mesothelial, 45 macrophages.  He also had 245
red blood cells, LDH 55, glucose 72.  Gram stain showed 2+
polys, but no microorganisms with evidence of SBP.  The
patient was started on prophylaxis with Ciprofloxacin 500 mg
b.i.d. for seven days in the setting of a gastrointestinal
bleed.  After being stabilized the patient was transferred to
the floor on [**2512-3-16**].  Repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy did
not show any evidence of varices.  The patient underwent a
therapeutic paracentesis on [**2512-3-17**] with improvement in
symptoms.  The patient also had his diuretics increased to
help alleviate further development of ascites and congestion.


On [**2512-3-18**] the patient was discharged to home in stable
condition.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  1.  Protonix 40 mg po b.i.d. for four
weeks.  2.  Aldactone 50 mg po b.i.d.  3.  Lasix 20 mg po
q.d.  4.  Ciprofloxacin 500 mg po b.i.d. for seven days total
and then to be changed to 750 mg po q week for prophylaxis.
4.  HAART therapy will be restarted as an outpatient.

The patient has the following appointments scheduled at the
time of discharge, with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7651**] of GI on [**2512-4-19**] at

     INDICATION:
     Patient with HIV, HCV with lactic acidosis and abdominal pain. The patient is
     status post recent endoscopy for upper GI bleed. Rule out ischemic gut,
     pancreatitis. Evaluate liver for mass.
     
     TECHNIQUE:
     A CT angiogram of the abdominal aorta was performed following a rapid bolus of
     150 cc Optiray. Precontrast and multiphasic scans were obtained through the
     abdomen. Multiplanar reconstructions were generated.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST:
     There are small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive
     atelectasis. The liver is somewhat small, but not particularly nodular in
     contour. There are four subcentimeter low attenuation lesions measuring up to
     5 - 6 mm which are nonspecific and too small to characterize by CT. Two of the
     lesions are in the lateral segment of the left hepatic lobe (segment 3). Two
     of the lesions are in the inferior right hepatic lobe (segment 5). No
     enhancing mass is identified within the liver. No biliary ductal dilatation.
     There is mild splenomegaly. The pancreatic parenchyma enhances normally with a
     normal acinar pattern. The adrenals and kidneys are normal in appearance.
     There is a tiny gallstone within the gallbladder with no gallbladder wall
     thickening.
     
     Immediately inferior to the gastric antrum and duodenal bulb, there is free
     air within the mesentery, likely postprocedural. There is a moderate - large
     amount of ascites. Wall thickening of the hepatic flexure is nonspecific and
     may be due to the ascites. There is no evidence of bowel obstruction. The
     visualized bowel loops demonstrate enhancement.
     
     Evaluation of the vasculature demonstrates a widely patent celiac, SMA and
     [**Female First Name (un) **]. The renal arteries are widely patent bilaterally. Note is made of an
     accessory right hepatic artery from the SMA. The portal vein, SMV and splenic
     vein are patent.
     
     No suspicious osseous lesions are demonstrated.
     
     Multiplanar reconstructions confirm the findings.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:
     Patient with HIV, HCV with lactic acidosis and abdominal pain. The patient is
     status post recent endoscopy for upper GI bleed. Rule out ischemic gut,
     pancreatitis. Evaluate liver for mass.
     
     TECHNIQUE:
     A CT angiogram of the abdominal aorta was performed following a rapid bolus of
     150 cc Optiray. Precontrast and multiphasic scans were obtained through the
     abdomen. Multiplanar reconstructions were generated.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST:
     There are small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive
     atelectasis. The liver is somewhat small, but not particularly nodular in
     contour. There are four subcentimeter low attenuation lesions measuring up to
     5 - 6 mm which are nonspecific and too small to characterize by CT. Two of the
     lesions are in the lateral segment of the left hepatic lobe (segment 3). Two
     of the lesions are in the inferior right hepatic lobe (segment 5). No
     enhancing mass is identified within the liver. No biliary ductal dilatation.
     There is mild splenomegaly. The pancreatic parenchyma enhances normally with a
     normal acinar pattern. The adrenals and kidneys are normal in appearance.
     There is a tiny gallstone within the gallbladder with no gallbladder wall
     thickening.
     
     Immediately inferior to the gastric antrum and duodenal bulb, there is free
     air within the mesentery, likely postprocedural. There is a moderate - large
     amount of ascites. Wall thickening of the hepatic flexure is nonspecific and
     may be due to the ascites. There is no evidence of bowel obstruction. The
     visualized bowel loops demonstrate enhancement.
     
     Evaluation of the vasculature demonstrates a widely patent celiac, SMA and
     [**Female First Name (un) **]. The renal arteries are widely patent bilaterally. Note is made of an
     accessory right hepatic artery from the SMA. The portal vein, SMV and splenic
     vein are patent.
     
     No suspicious osseous lesions are demonstrated.
     
     Multiplanar reconstructions confirm the findings.
     
     IMPRESSION:
                                                                 (Over)

With vigorous stimuli, pt would wake up and was answering questions appropriately.  Around 0200, pt more awake, opening eyes spontaneously and interacting verbally (baseline).  Pt c/o [**8-6**] pain at CT insertion site--responded well to 0.5 mg IV MS04 (pt dosed conservatively since he had been so lethargic for most of shift).  
  CV:  Afebrile.  Pt transfused with 2 u prbc during the evening--hct bumped from 21.5 to 24.  MD aware and another u prbc (#8 total) hanging.  Hct to be rechecked s/p transfusion.  AM INR within goal.  Pt also given 100g albumin for colloid replacement.  Pt's TLC with only 2 functioning ports (unable to flush blue port).  [**Known patient lastname **] port flushes with some resistance though it has a brisk blood return.  PIV X 2 are patent.  Clot current in BB.  At 2200, fingerstick checked in setting of pts lethargy--FSBG=78--[**12-30**] amp D50 given with improved sugars.  FS again in 70's at 0300--D50 repeated, will checks glucose at 0600.  Pt did not have any visible improvement in MS after D50.
  Pulm:  Pt with sp02 100% on 2 L NC.  Lung sounds CTA, diminished R base.  R anterior pigtail with + oscillation/small airleak with cough only.  Small amt serosanguinous drainage with CT at 20 cm water suction.  CXR at 2100 with much improved pneumothorax.
  GI:  Pt lethargic and not taking any PO's overnight.  Abd soft with + BS. No stool/N/V.
  GU:  Foley draining QS amber clear urine.

     SINGLE VIEW CHEST, [**2512-12-5**]:
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Pneumothorax.  Chest pain.
     
     A small bore catheter remains in place in the pleural space on the right.
     There is a very small right pneumothorax which is slightly decrease in size in
     the interval.
     
     The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in the interval.  The lungs
     reveal persistent left retrocardiac opacity with adjacent worsening opacity at
     the left base peripherally with adjacent blunting of the costophrenic angle.
     There is also increasing opacity in the right middle and right lower lobes
     with obscuration of the right heart border and right hemidiaphragm
     respectively.  There is also a small right pleural effusion.
     
     Subcutaneous emphysema is seen in the right chest wall, increased in the
     interval.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Small right apical pneumothorax, slightly decreased in size compared to
     recent study.
     2)  Worsening areas of increased lung opacity in the right middle and both
     lower lobes.  Although possibly due to atelectasis, pneumonia should be
     considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
     3)  Small bilateral pleural effusions.

     HISTORY:  Hepatitis C cirrhosis, now with DIC, no clear source.  Suspected
     hepatocellular carcinoma. Please evaluate for liver mets.
     
     COMPARISON: [**2512-8-2**].
     
     LIVER ULTRASOUND:  The liver is nodular in appearance, consistent with
     patient's know cirrhosis.  No focal masses are seen.  The main portal vein was
     patent and demonstrates hepatopetal flow.  There is no evidence of intra or
     extrahepatic biliary dilatation.
     
     The gallbladder  is thick-walled, measuring 5 mm in size.  The gallbladder
     contains a large amount of echogenic material.  No pericholecytic fluid is
     seen.  A 6 mm cyst is seen, in the left lobe of the liver.  The spleen is
     enlarged, measuring 14.7 cm in size.  A left-sided pleural effusion is noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Nodular liver, consistent with cirrhosis.  No focal masses.
     
     2)  Gallbladder wall thickening, but this patient has low albumin which could
     be accounting for this finding.
     
     3)  Tumefactive echogenic material within the gallbladder lumen which was not
     present previously and most likely represents tumefactive sludge.
