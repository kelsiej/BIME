Admission Date:  [**3184-3-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**3184-3-26**]
 
Date of Birth:  [**3090-5-19**]             Sex:   F
 
Service: MEDICINE
 
Allergies: 
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs
 
Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4822**] 
Chief Complaint:
Presented with unresponsiveness and mental status change.

 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation on [**3184-3-22**].
 
History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old woman with a history of hypertension who 
presented on [**3-22**] after being found unresponsive by her 
caregiver at home.  
.
As per MICU notes, the patient ""was found by her caregiver this 
morning around 9 am unresponsive. Had last been seen by her 
caregiver the night before, 6 pm, in her usual state of health."" 
Per her niece, the patient had been more lethargic over the past 
10 days and had seemed short of breath. No other complaints 
noted.  
.  
In the ED, her initial vitals were 99.6, 117/91, 92, 16, and 
97%RA. She was unresponsive to sternal rub and had no gag 
reflex. She was intubated for airway protection. She was sedated 
with propofol (unclear why as unresponsive?) She then became 
hypotensive to the 80s/50s and propofol was turned off; she got 
a bolus of one liter and her blood pressure responded to 130/47. 
Her ECG showed new TWI in II, III, and aVF, and her troponin was 
positive at 0.21. She was given solumedrol 125 mg, ceftriaxone 2 
grams, vancomycin 1 gram, and aspirin 600 mg pr. She had a 
lumbar puncture and a head CT which were unremarkable. Her CXR 
showed kyphoscoliosis and borderline cardiomegaly but no acute 
lung process.  
.  
Upon arrival to the MICU, her niece reported that the patient is 
DNR/DNI and would not want invasive procedures. She stated that 
the patient would want to be extubated, so patient was 
extubated.  Upon discontinuation of the propofol, the patient 
was awake, alert, and oriented.""

As per report, she denied any complaints, including no chest 
pain, cough, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, and 
abdominal pain.  
.
An echocardiogram obtained yesterday, [**3-23**], demonstrated a 
dilated RV with RV hypokinesis and pulmonary hypertension, an 
underfilled LV cavity with LVH and hyperdynamic LVEF and a small 
ASD with  
bidrectional flow at rest. Findings are suggestive of RV strain 
(PE?) and intracardiac shunting.  
.
The MICU team has had extensive discussion with the patient and 
her family and decision has made to pursue comfort measures 
only.
.
She is transferred to the floor at this time.  

 
Past Medical History:
Hypertension.
 
Social History:
Lives at home with caretaker.  Former smoker. 

 
Family History:
Non-contributory.
 
Physical Exam:
On transfer to floor, patient CMO.
Patient appeared comfortable.
 
Pertinent Results:
Images:
Cardiac ECHO ([**3184-3-23**]): 
Dilated RV with RV hypokinesis and pulmonary hypertension.  
Underfilled LV cavity with LVH and hyperdynamic LVEF. A small 
ASD with bidrectional flow at rest. These findings are 
suggestive, but not diagnostic for RV strain (PE?) and 
intracardiac shunting. 
.
CT head ([**3184-3-22**]):  
1.  No acute intracranial process.  2.  Moderate global atrophy, 
with chronic bilateral basal ganglia lacunes.  3.  Possible 
acute-on-chronic inflammatory changes involving the maxillary 
and ethmoid sinuses and right mastoid air cells. 
.
Chest Xray ([**3184-3-22**]):  
1)  ET tube tip roughly 3.7 cm proximal to the carina, likely in 
satisfactory position.  2)  Marked thoracic kyphoscoliosis and 
right chest wall deformity related to multiple rib fractures, as 
before. 
3)  Linear scarring and atelectasis involving the right lung, 
but no definite consolidation. 4)  Borderline cardiomegaly 
without CHF.

     CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST DATED [**3184-3-22**].
     
     HISTORY:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with altered mental status, unresponsive and
     intubated; ? bleed.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous 5 mm axial tomographic sections were obtained from the
     skull base to the vertex and viewed in brain and bone window on the
     workstation.
     
     FINDINGS:  There are no comparisons on record.  There is no intra- or extra-
     axial hemorrhage and the midline structures are in the midline.  There is
     moderate, proportionate prominence of the cortical sulci and fissures and the
     ventricles and cisterns, representing global atrophy.  There are scattered
     small low-attenuation foci in the basal ganglia, bilaterally, likely
     representing chronic lacunes, with only slight evidence of chronic
     microvascular infarction in periventricular white matter.  There is no finding
     to suggest acute vascular territorial infarction.  Noted is extensive
     calcification of the cavernous and supraclinoid segments of both internal
     carotid arteries.  There is mucosal thickening involving several ethmoidal air
     cells and both maxillary antra with a possible fluid level on the right.  The
     right mastoid air cells are largely opacified.  No skull fracture is seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No acute intracranial process.
     2.  Moderate global atrophy, with chronic bilateral basal ganglia lacunes.
     3.  Possible acute-on-chronic inflammatory changes involving the maxillary and
     ethmoid sinuses and right mastoid air cells.
     
     COMMENT:  These findings were transmitted electronically to the [**Hospital Unit Name 277**] at time of
     this dictation.

     SINGLE VIEW CHEST [**3184-3-22**]:
     
     HISTORY:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with rhonchi and decreased mental status; ?
     infiltrate or edema, and check ETT placement.
     
     FINDINGS: Very limited bedside AP examination labeled ""supine at 10:05 a.m.""
     with patient markedly rotated to her left.  The tip of the endotracheal tube
     lies at the level of the inferior margin of the clavicles, roughly 3.7 cm
     proximal to the carina.  Evaluation is limited technical factors, as well as
     the patient's kyphoscoliosis, some of which relates to diffuse osteopenia with
     compression deformities of several mid-thoracic vertebrae. There are also
     several old, healed consecutive right rib fractures.  There is linear
     atelectasis or scarring involving the right mid- and lower lung, as on study
     dated [**3181-3-10**]; since that time, the linear opacity in the left lung base has
     largely cleared, with no definite focal consolidation seen.  Allowing for the
     above factors, the heart is probably top normal in size, with dense mitral
     annular calcification.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion, pleural
     effusion, or other evidence of CHF.
     
     IMPRESSION: Limited study, with:
     1)  ET tube tip roughly 3.7 cm proximal to the carina, likely in satisfactory
     position.
     2)  Marked thoracic kyphoscoliosis and right chest wall deformity related to
     multiple rib fractures, as before.
     3)  Linear scarring and atelectasis involving the right lung, but no definite
     consolidation.
     4)  Borderline cardiomegaly without CHF.

Nursing Progress Note:

Pt. is called out and awaiting a bed. Pt. is DNR/DNI and is also CMO due to BP dropping very low at times.

Neuro: Pt. was quite alert in the morning, 0X2 but following commands and carrying on an appropriate conversation. She does not remember people visiting her unless reminded but did converse with nephew briefly during his visit. She assists with turns and moves upper extremities well, lower extremities minimally. She has no c/o pain.

CV: HR 80s-90s NSR with no ectopy, NBP 70s-100s/40s-50s. She does not appear symptomatic when BP has dropped and has stabilized on her own. 
Pt. has  20g IV in L wrist which leaks but works well if pulled bacj slightly.

Resp: Lungs are clear with crackles at times and diminished bases. 02 sats are 80-94%. NC increased from 2L to 4L with 02 sats now in high 80s to low 90s. No signs of resp distress.

GI: Pt. ate a large breakfast and had 2 large BMs on shift.

GU: UO is minimal, no interventions ordered.

Skin: Slight redness to  back but no open areas noted.
