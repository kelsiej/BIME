Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was taken from the ER straight to the operating room where an 
emergent R axillary-bifemoral bypass graft was performed with 
PTFE to restore blood flow to the lower extremities after an 
acute aortic occlusion.  Postopreatively, the patient initially 
did well.  She was quickly extubated.  Within a short amount of 
time the patient began to have problems maintaining adequate 
blood pressure requiring the use of pressors.  She was found to 
have an acute metabolic acidosis for which the patient was 
placed on a bicarbonate drip.  Over the course of the next 12 to 
18 hours the patients condition worsened.  A swan ganz catheter 
was placed to better monitor the patient's needs.  She was found 
to have low SVO2's, High SVR's, low PAD's/CVP's/Wedges.  The 
patient was bolused many liters of fluid.  Because the patient's 
cardiac output/index were low she was tried on milrinone.  This 
did not in effect help.  It only made her tachycardic.  
Meanwhile the patient began to have respiratory distress.  
Emergent tracheostomy was performed as endotracheal intubation 
was not an option due to pharyngeal edema.  Persistent lactic 
acidosis and developing renal failure then prompted consultation 
with the general surgery service.  The patient was then taken to 
the OR for abdominal exploration.  The patient had ischemic 
right colon but it did not appear dead.  No resection was 
performed.  Furthermore, the pt's hemodynamics improved with 
abdominal decompression indicating abdominal compartment 
syndrome.  Over the next day the patient required large amounts 
of fluid and began to develop further problems with hemodynamic 
stability.  In the early morning of [**2746-7-10**] the patient was being 
turned and became suddenly unable to be ventilated.  The patient 
was amboo'd.  Airway resistence was strikingly high.  
Auscultation revealed decreased breath sounds on the L lung 
field.  An emergent chest tube was placed with immediate 
drainage of about 1400 cc of serosanguinous fluid.  CO2 
detectors were used to insure CO2 exchange which was confirmed 
present.  A stat blood gas showed a PCO2 in the 20's and a PO2 
in the 200's.  Meanwhile, the pt began to brady down and become 
asystolic.  CPR was performed for approximately 20 minutes while 
numerous chemical modalities were tried to revive the patient.  
Ultimately we were unsuccessful, and the patient was declared 
dead at 443 am on [**2749-7-10**].
