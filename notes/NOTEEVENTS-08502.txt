   RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2596-6-8**] 9:34 AM
PORTABLE CHEST OF [**2596-6-8**]
COMPARISON: [**2596-6-6**].
Right PICC line and right chest tube are unchanged in position. 
Cardiac and mediastinal contours show interval decrease in 
width, likely due to improving volume status of the patient. 
There is also improvement in bilateral asymmetric perihilar and 
basilar alveolar process, particularly in the left perihilar 
region. Although these opacities may in part be due to improving 
pulmonary edema, underlying pneumonia is suspected, particularly 
in the lower lobes. Moderate right pleural effusion is 
unchanged.

   RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2596-6-6**] 10:39 AM
CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST
Contrast: OPTIRAY

INDICATION: 51-year-old with head and neck cancer, recent 
pancreatitis, presenting with acute shortness of breath, rule 
out PE and reassess abdominal collections.

COMPARISONS: CT torso of [**2596-5-31**].
TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis 
with oral and 100 cc of nonionic Optiray contrast.

CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: Right-sided chest tube remains in 
place. There are bilateral pleural effusions, with persisting 
consolidation in the right lower lobe. The mid and upper lung 
zones are clear. The airway is patent to the segmental level. 
The pulmonary arteries enhance normally without filling defect. 
There are diffuse enlarged lymph[**MD Number 65**] throughout the 
mediastinum, suspicious for metastatic nodes. The thoracic aorta 
is normal in caliber and enhances normally. Multiple small 
subcentimeter axillary nodes.

CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Again demonstrated are multiple 
small thin- walled fluid collections throughout the abdomen, not 
significantly changed in size and appearance compared to the 
prior study. None of these are large enough for safe 
percutaneous drainage. The pancreatic parenchyma enhances 
homogeneously without evidence of significant necrosis or 
intraparenchymal abscess. There are coarse calcifications along 
the duct near the pancreatic head, likely the sequela of chronic 
pancreatitis. Moderate amount of ascites surrounding the liver 
and throughout the pelvis. Small ill-defined hepatic hypodense 
lesion within segment VI, too small to characterize. Additional 
tiny hypodense lesion in segment V anteriorly, too small to 
characterize as well. Cholelithiasis without evidence of 
cholecystitis. The kidneys, adrenal glands, stomach, and 
proximal small bowel are normal. The spleen contains an 
ill-defined lesion posteriorly, not well characterized on this 
study.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Large amount of ascites and free 
fluid in the pelvis. Subcentimeter inguinal lymph[**MD Number 65**]. No 
pathologically enlarged lymph[**MD Number 65**] are seen.

BONE WINDOWS: 2.5-cm ill-defined lytic lesion in the right iliac 
bone lateral to the SI joint, suspicious for metastasis. Old 
right lateral rib fracture, demonstrating some callus formation. 
No other suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.

MULTIPLANAR REFORMATS: Coronal and sagittal reformatted images 
confirm the above findings.

IMPRESSION:
1) No pulmonary embolism.
2) Stable size and appearance of multiple small fluid 
collections throughout the abdomen, likely pancreatic 
pseudocysts; too small to be amenable to percutaneous drainage.
3) Bilateral pleural effusions with right lower lobe 
consolidation which may relate to persisting pneumonia versus 
less likely lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
4) Enlarged mediastinal lymphadenopathy, suspicious for 
metastatic nodes.
5) Stable moderate abdominal and pelvic ascites.
6) 2.5cm lytic lesion in the right iliac bone lateral to the SI 
joint, suspicious for metastasis.
7) Small hypodense lesions in the liver and spleen, too small to 
characterize.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
#Pancreatitis: Upon admission to [**Hospital1 83**] on [**2596-5-7**] he was started 
on Morphine PCA and Neurontin for [**9-8**] pain, he was placed on IV 
fluids, made NPO, and continued on TPN. An abdominal CT at this 
time showed pancreatic pseudocyst given history of pancreatitis, 
ascites, bilateral pleural effusions - right greater than left. 
A abdominal CT on [**2596-5-31**] showed multiple dynamic fluid 
collections again seen within the abdomen, some smaller and some 
larger when compared to prior study. Relatively stable fluid 
collection seen in the area of the head of the pancreas.'
[**2596-5-14**] tube feedings were started for nutritional support. The 
feedins were discontinued several days later when his 
prancreatic enzymes [**Hospital Ward Name **] rocketed to the 2700 range.  The patient 
was, however, asymptomatic in terms of abdominal pain/N/V. He 
was subsequently maintained on TPN with complete bowel bowel 
rest. His pancreatic enzymes were monitored regularly and 
remained elevated.
.
# Respiratory/Bilateral pleural effusions/pneumonia: [**2595-5-9**] he 
was intubated for respiratory distress, on [**2596-5-9**] he was re 
intubated after self-extubation. Blood cultures revealed GPC 
[**3-5**]. a sputum sample revealed 2+ yeast. A chest x-ray revealed 
worsening of his bilateral pleural effusions with associated 
basilar atelectasis. He was being suctioned for copious thick 
rusty/blood tinged secretions and respiratory support was 
continued. An NGT was draining small quantities of bilious 
fluid. Antibiotics Imipenem-Cilastatin was given for pneumonia 
empirically. [**2596-5-11**] he was extubated and placed on a 50% face 
tent. A Heimlich valve/chest tube was placed to the right medial 
chest. 
[**2596-5-14**] Thoracic surgery was consulted. A chest tube was placed 
on the right side.  On [**2596-5-15**] he was transfered back to the ICU 
for O2 sats to 80% and tachycardia with his heart rate in the 
130's. He was started on Vancomycin, Flagyl, and Levofloxacin 
for a rising WBC count. He went to the OR on [**2596-5-17**] for a right 
VATS, decortication and bronchoscopy with chest tubes x 3. 
Pleural tissue was Staphylcoccus coagulase negative. The patient 
continued to having respiratory difficulty and the bilateral 
effusions were very slow to improve. He completed a 2-week 
course of vanocymycin.
[**2596-5-23**] Interventional pulmonolgy performed a therapeutic 
throacentesis of the left side, draining 1000cc.
[**2596-5-31**] the patient had acute onset of shortness of breath and an 
O2 saturation of 75% and was transfered to the ICU. He responded 
well to Lasix and nebulizers and continued respiratory care. He 
was transfered back to the floor on [**2596-6-2**]. Chest tubes were 
sequentially discontinued per the thoracic surgery service over 
the next 2 weeks. The last tube was removed on [**2596-6-8**], a 
follow-up chest x-ray was negative for pneumothorax.
.
#Hemetology: The patient was transfused on multiple occasions 
from [**Date range (1) 11810**] for anemia of chronic disease.  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 11811**] 
white count continued to be slightly elevated throughout his 
hospital stay, though is currently trending down. 
.
# Aspiration/failed swallowing: Speech and Swallow was consulted 
on [**2596-5-20**] for aspiration and continued to recommend he stay 
NPO. They again saw the patient on [**2596-5-24**] for reevaluation of 
his swallowing. Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] was noted to have symptoms of 
aspiration  of any liquids/thickened liquids/solids taken PO. He 
was also noted at this time to have a left tongue mass. He was 
kept NPO. A doubhoff was placed the next day in order to 
administer medications enterally.  Over the next 5-7 days the 
patient removed the doubhoff on multiple occassions. It was 
ultimately not replaced and his medications converted again to 
IV form.
.
#Large tongue mass: ENT/ORL consult was obtained on [**2596-5-24**] for 
a left, posterior tongue lesion. The patient had slurring of 
speach and difficulty with clearing of oropharyngeal secretions. 
 The mass is 2 cm firm lesion and highly concerning for 
malignancy especially given the patient's history of alcohol and 
tobacco abuse. A biopsy was done on at the bedside on [**2596-6-7**] by 
ENT.  Oncology was also consulted regarding his tongue mass. 
They had no specific course of treatment without a confrimed 
tissue diagnosis.
.
#Decub ulcer: a Wound Care consult was obtained for evaluation 
of a coccyx skin breakdown and Duoderm was placed on the site, 
and other skin care measures were continued.
.
#Disposition: Continued hospitalization in [**Location (un) 210**], at such a 
distance from home, continued to put added strain on Mr. 
[**Known patient lastname 11811**] family. Per the patient's request arrangements were 
made to transfer him back to Southern New [**Hospital 11812**] Medical 
Center where he was originally hospitalized.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11813**] 
accepted the patient's return. He was transfered on [**2596-6-9**].

     INDICATION:  51-year-old male with pancreatic abscess.  Evaluate for post-
     drainage.
     
     No comparison studies.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:
     
     The visualized lung bases demonstrate a few focal areas of ground- glass
     opacities.  There is a moderate-sized right pleural effusion and small left
     pleural effusion.  Associated bibasilar atelectasis. There is a focal low-
     attenuation lesion within the right lobe of the liver that is too small to
     characterize.  The gallbladder contains multiple tiny stones.
     
     Multiple low attenuation lesions are seen within the upper abdomen. Lesion #1
     is within the region of the pancreatic head and measures 2.0 x 2.3 cm. Lesion
     #2 extends between the IVC and portal vein measuring 2.3 x 2.4 x 6.0 cm.
     Lesion #3 is just posterior to the stomach measuring 2.0 x2.6 cm. Lesion #4 is
     partially loculated and is more posterior th the stomach adjacent to the
     splenic flexure. Lesion #5 is on the right in the posterior para renal space
     measuring 3.2 x10.0.
     
     Lateral to the head of the pancreas, there are multiple punctate
     calcifications either representing pancreatic calcifications, given history or
     they could be CBD stones, however there is no biliary dilitation.
     
     The kidneys and adrenal glands are within normal limits. Small bowel and large
     bowel are unremarkable. A nasogastric tube is seen extending into the stomach.
     Vascular calcifications are seen within the aorta, celiac axis, SMA, splenic
     artery and renal arteries.  The spleen is within normal limits. There is a
     significant amount of low-attenuation fluid density seen perihepatic and
     perisplenic and tracking down into the pelvis consistent with ascites.  There
     is a focal air collection within the pelvis.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The urinary bladder is catheterized.  The rectum
     is unremarkable.  Prostatic calcifications are present.  No pathologically
     enlarged retroperitoneal, mesenteric, pelvic lymphadenopathy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Multiple fluid collections as mentioned detailed . Most likely diagnosis
     includes pancreatic pseudocysts given history of pancreatitis.
     2.  Calcifications lateral to pancreatic head, most likely representing
     pancreatic calcifications given history of pancreatitis. These could also
     represent CBD stones, however, no biliary obstruction is presen. Due to the
     multiple pseudocysts and inflammation in the pancreatic bed - the normal
     anatomic relationships are distorted, making exact localization of these
     calcifications somewhat limitied.
     4.  Ascites.
     5.  Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
     6.  Focal low-attenuation lesion within the right lobe of the liver, too small
     to characterize.

     drainage.
     
     No comparison studies.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:
     
     The visualized lung bases demonstrate a few focal areas of ground- glass
     opacities.  There is a moderate-sized right pleural effusion and small left
     pleural effusion.  Associated bibasilar atelectasis. There is a focal low-
     attenuation lesion within the right lobe of the liver that is too small to
     characterize.  The gallbladder contains multiple tiny stones.
     
     Multiple low attenuation lesions are seen within the upper abdomen. Lesion #1
     is within the region of the pancreatic head and measures 2.0 x 2.3 cm. Lesion
     #2 extends between the IVC and portal vein measuring 2.3 x 2.4 x 6.0 cm.
     Lesion #3 is just posterior to the stomach measuring 2.0 x2.6 cm. Lesion #4 is
     partially loculated and is more posterior th the stomach adjacent to the
     splenic flexure. Lesion #5 is on the right in the posterior para renal space
     measuring 3.2 x10.0.
     
     Lateral to the head of the pancreas, there are multiple punctate
     calcifications either representing pancreatic calcifications, given history or
     they could be CBD stones, however there is no biliary dilitation.
     
     The kidneys and adrenal glands are within normal limits. Small bowel and large
     bowel are unremarkable. A nasogastric tube is seen extending into the stomach.
     Vascular calcifications are seen within the aorta, celiac axis, SMA, splenic
     artery and renal arteries.  The spleen is within normal limits. There is a
     significant amount of low-attenuation fluid density seen perihepatic and
     perisplenic and tracking down into the pelvis consistent with ascites.  There
     is a focal air collection within the pelvis.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The urinary bladder is catheterized.  The rectum
     is unremarkable.  Prostatic calcifications are present.  No pathologically
     enlarged retroperitoneal, mesenteric, pelvic lymphadenopathy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.

     HISTORY:  51-year-old male with pancreatic cysts, now status post right
     thoracentesis with dyspnea.
     
     COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, [**5-8**] through [**2596-5-9**].
     
     SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST:  Endotracheal tube tip is 5 cm above the carina.  Left
     subclavian central line tip is in the proximal SVC.  Compared to the earliest
     chest film on [**5-8**], there has been progressive mediastinal widening and
     increase in size of the cardiac silhouette concerning for elevated central
     venous pressure and pericardial effusion.  Given differences in patient
     positioning compared to [**5-9**], there is probable decrease in size of right
     pleural effusion which is now moderate to large.  There remains a persistent
     small left pleural effusion.  Prominent interstitial markings are compatible
     with mild interstitial edema.
     
     The results of this study were discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 792**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8396**] on [**2596-5-10**].

Patient admitted for OSH for surgical work-up for pancreatitis. Upon evaluation surgeons deemed that no surgery was necessary. Patient electively intubated for CT scan of the abdomen, with a planned to extubate post procedure. However, patient has since failed to wean from ventilation.

Review of Systems:

Resp - Patient initially on CPAP/PS (abg pao2 83), changed to CMV with good effect (abg pH 7.40, PaCO2 37, PaO2 120), changed back to CPAP/PS FiO2 50%, PEEP 5, PS 15. SpO2 >06%, RR 25-35. Breath sounds now clear throughout with aggressive chest PT, Q2 turns, deep suction. Copious amounts of thick tan secretions on ETT suction. ETT resecured with fabric holder in addition to tapes.

CVS - Sinus rhythm, with minimal ectopy witnessed. HR 100-115bpm, SBP 95-130, MAP 70-90, CVP 7-9, T max 100.0. Peripherally warm/well perfused/palpable pedal and radial pulses. Serial HCT Q6 25.6-25.9%. 0200 labs Hb down to 8.6, WCC down to 21.2, Lactate 1.4. Continues on IV ABS.

Renal - UO 70-100ml/hr, 24 hour balance +ve 1600ml. 0200 labs K+ 3.6, Mg 1.8, Ca 8.1. 

Neuro - Sedated with propofol and fentanyl, easily rousable, and appears comfortable when not stimulated. MAE. GCS 11 (e3v2m6). Obeying commands. No apparent pain.

GI - TPN 75ml/hr. NG tube to LCS - minimal bilious fluid. Abdomen firm/distended (unchanged). Fecal collector bag in situ, minimal output overnight. Blood glucose stable with ISS.

Skin - given full bed bath at beginning of shift. Skin grossly intact.

     CT OF THE CHEST ON [**5-13**]
     
     HISTORY:  Persistent right pleural effusion following chest tube placement,
     evaluate for loculation.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector helical scanning of the chest was performed without
     intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 74**].  Reconstructed are contiguous 5- and 1.25-mm thick
     axial images compared with the chest portion of a CT of the torso on [**2596-5-8**].
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     Large right pleural effusion has increased in volume.  A small-bore right
     pleural tube inserted in the interim, enters the lateral chest and cannulates
     the right major fissure between the collapsed middle and lower lobes. Non
     hemorrhagic pleural effusion, with small pockets of air, fills most of the
     right hemithorax aside from the partially inflated right upper lobe and
     largely layers posteriorly, although there may be a small anterolateral
     loculation at the level of the aortic arch. Small nonhemorrhagic left pleural
     effusion also layers posteriorly.  A small pericardial effusion is
     present, with no findings to suggest tamponade.
     
     Central adenopathy consists of 13-mm right upper internal mammary, 12-mm right
     lower paratracheal, 10-mm left lower paratracheal, and 19-mm subcarinal nodes.
     The right upper lobe bronchus is severely narrowed by hilar lymph nodes
     ranging up to 12 mm in diameter.  Distal to that the entire right bronchial
     tree is occluded, probably by retained secretions.  Aside from dependent
     atelectasis in the left lower lobe and a small region of ground- glass opacity
     in the left upper lung, the left lung is clear.  Because of the extensive
     atelectasis in the right lung, significant pathology would not be apparent.
     
     Heavy atherosclerotic calcification is seen in both coronaries, left greater
     than right, and at the origin of the head and neck vessels near the aortic
     arch.
     
     Findings in the upper abdomen have not changed since [**5-8**] when the report
     of a Torso CT described ascites and calcifications in the gallbladder, bile
     duct, and head of the pancreas.
     
     A left-sided central venous line ends in the upper SVC.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     1.  Large, increasing nonhemorrhagic right pleural effusion.  Small-bore right
     pleural tube is fissural.
     
     2.  Moderately extensive central adenopathy probably contributing to right
     upper lobe narrowing.  Most of the right lung is collapsed from a combination
     of relaxation atelectasis, right upper lobe narrowing, and retained secretions
     more distally in the right bronchial tree.
     
     3.  Stable small nonhemorrhagic layering left pleural effusion.
     
     4.  Heavy coronary atherosclerosis.
     
     5.  Ascites and biliary and pancreatic calcifications, upper abdomen,
     unchanged since  Torso CT [**2596-5-8**].

     REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation for right lung expansion and pneumothorax
     in a patient after right VATS, decortication, and placement of three chest
     tubes.
     
     Portable AP supine chest radiograph is reviewed and compared to the previous
     film from [**2596-5-15**].
     
     The ET tube tip is in good position projecting 4.4 cm above the carina.  The
     NG tube and the left subclavian line are in good position.
     
     The previously seen complete atelectasis of the right lung do not exist now
     with re-expanding of the right lung and a relatively small right lower lobe
     consolidation is seen representing a re-expanding lung or true consolidation.
     Three chest tubes are inserted, two of them in the apex and one of them in the
     base of the lung.  No pneumothorax is seen.  No sizeable amount of pleural
     effusion is present.  Small subcutaneous emphysema within the chest wall on
     the right is demonstrates.
     
     The left lung is slightly less translucent than demonstrated on the previous
     film. This may be due to the shifting of the mediastinum towards the left now.
     Slight volume overload should also be considered as the cause.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Satisfactory position of tubes and lines.
     2.  Re-expanding right lung.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Right lower lung
     consolidation is still present.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CT SCAN OF THE NECK.
     
     HISTORY:  Evaluate tongue mass.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Bolus intravenously-enhanced imaging of the neck.
     
     COMPARISON STUDY:  None.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is an enormous, ill-defined mass lesion which appears
     centered in the left side of the tongue, essentially extending from the free
     margin to the tongue base, with both effacement and rightward deviation of the
     median raphe.  It is likely that the tongue mass infiltrates the genioglossus
     muscles. The mass also involves the left-sided oropharyngeal wall and appears
     to potentially extend as far cephalad as the left fossa of Rosenmuller,
     although in a somewhat discontinuous fashion.  Alternatively, a separate mass
     may be present in this locale.  There is no evidence on either the head CT
     scan or this neck CT imaging study of opacification of either the left middle
     ear cavity or mastoid sinus complex to indicate left-sided eustachian tube
     obstruction.  It is also likely that there are multiple large lymph nodes
     within the submandibular region, particularly on the left side, some of which
     have low-density centers suggesting necrosis.  A rounded left-sided
     jugulodigastric node is seen, measuring 14 mm in diameter. Additional necrotic
     lymph nodes are also seen at the hyoid bone level, involving both jugular
     chains.  An additional necrotic lymph node is also noted at the level of the
     thyroid cartilage on the left.
     
     There is also gross asymmetry of the internal aspect of the larynx, suggesting
     that there may be some infiltration of the mass from the tongue into the
     supraglottic region on the left side.  There is resultant marked asymmetry of
     the supraglottic airway.  Gas is seen within the right but not the left
     piriform sinus.  There is a chest tube seen within the posterior aspect of the
     right hemithorax, with what is likely surrounding pleural fluid, and a much
     larger posteriorly situated pleural-based soft tissue region is seen, again
     also presumably representing pleural fluid.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Gigantic mass within multiple compartments of the neck, including
     the tongue likely with many necrotic lymph nodes.  Clearly this picture
     suggest an extremely aggressive malignancy, most commonly squamous cell
     cancer, given the history of smoking and alcohol intake. In all probability,
     these abnormalities do have a relationship to the bilateral pleural fluid
                                                                 (Over)

     HISTORY:  Right chest tubes and large pleural effusion due to pancreatitis.
     
     IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to [**5-25**] and 28:
     
     Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis has progressed to complete collapse on the
     left. Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusion is unchanged.  Upper lungs
     show borderline pulmonary edema.  Right apical pleural tube still in place.
     Tiny right apical pneumothorax new or newly apparent.  Heart size normal.
     Mediastinum midline.  The weighted tip of the nasogastric feeding tube is at
     the level of the gastroesophageal junction and should be advanced to move all
     the side ports into the stomach.  Left subclavian line tip projects over the
     junction of the brachiocephalic veins.  Findings discussed with house officer
     caring for this patient at the time of dictation.

     INDICATION:  Pleural effusion assessment.  Pancreatitis.
     
     Two right-sided chest tubes remain in place.  Moderate-sized bilateral pleural
     effusions are without interval change allowing for slight positional
     differences.  Central venous catheter and feeding tube are also unchanged in
     position.  There has been decrease in cardiac silhouette size and decreased
     width of the vascular pedicle in keeping with improving volume status of the
     patient.  Previously reported mild pulmonary edema has resolved.  Atelectatic
     changes are again demonstrated in the lower lobes adjacent to the pleural
     effusions.

     INDICATION:  Low oxygen saturation.
     
     Right-sided chest tube and feeding tube are unchanged in position allowing for
     positional differences.  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  There is
     upper zone vascular redistribution and slight worsening of asymmetrical
     perihilar edema, right greater than left.  Moderate-sized pleural effusions
     are again demonstrated, with slight improvement on the left and slight
     worsening on the right.  Finally, a catheter overlies the right axilla, likely
     due to a PICC line, without interval change but with the tip proximal to the
     subclavian artery.

     COMPARISON:  CT torso [**2596-5-8**], CT chest [**2596-5-24**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired axial images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were
     obtained with and without IV contrast.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Chest tube is again noted on
     the right side.  Large bilateral effusions with associated large areas of lung
     consolidation with air bronchograms are seen, slightly larger compared to
     [**2596-5-24**].  Heart and mediastinum appear unchanged.  There is no evidence
     of pulmonary embolism.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  Again seen are multiple low-attenuation
     fluid collections throughout the upper abdomen. There is a relatively stable-
     appearing collection in the region of the head of the pancreas, likely
     representing pseudocyst.  The collection just posterior to the stomach appears
     slightly smaller compared to prior study. Collection in the right
     retroperitoneal region, in the medial posterior perirenal space, appears
     slightly larger compared to prior study. The pancreas appears to enhance
     normally. Again noted are multiple punctate calcifications lateral to the head
     of the pancreas, possibly representing common bile duct stones, however
     definitive localization is limited by distorted anatomy. Again seen are
     multiple gallstones within the gallbladder. Two rounded hypodensities within
     the right lobe of the liver appear unchanged from prior study, again too small
     to characterize by CT.  The spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys appear
     unremarkable.  Small and large bowel appear within normal limits. Again noted
     is a large amount of free fluid within the abdomen, tracking down to the
     pelvis, not significantly changed from prior study. Atherosclerotic disease is
     again noted throughout the abdominal aorta and celiac axis.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The rectum, sigmoid, bladder appear
     unchanged.  Again noted is air within the bladder, likely secondary to Foley
     catheterization.  Again seen is a large amount of free fluid within the
     pelvis, tracking down from the abdomen.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or bony lesions were seen.

     normally. Again noted are multiple punctate calcifications lateral to the head
     of the pancreas, possibly representing common bile duct stones, however
     definitive localization is limited by distorted anatomy. Again seen are
     multiple gallstones within the gallbladder. Two rounded hypodensities within
     the right lobe of the liver appear unchanged from prior study, again too small
     to characterize by CT.  The spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys appear
     unremarkable.  Small and large bowel appear within normal limits. Again noted
     is a large amount of free fluid within the abdomen, tracking down to the
     pelvis, not significantly changed from prior study. Atherosclerotic disease is
     again noted throughout the abdominal aorta and celiac axis.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The rectum, sigmoid, bladder appear
     unchanged.  Again noted is air within the bladder, likely secondary to Foley

     COMPARISON:  CT torso [**2596-5-8**], CT chest [**2596-5-24**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired axial images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were
     obtained with and without IV contrast.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Chest tube is again noted on
     the right side.  Large bilateral effusions with associated large areas of lung
     consolidation with air bronchograms are seen, slightly larger compared to
     [**2596-5-24**].  Heart and mediastinum appear unchanged.  There is no evidence
     of pulmonary embolism.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  Again seen are multiple low-attenuation
     fluid collections throughout the upper abdomen. There is a relatively stable-
     appearing collection in the region of the head of the pancreas, likely
     representing pseudocyst.  The collection just posterior to the stomach appears
     slightly smaller compared to prior study. Collection in the right
     retroperitoneal region, in the medial posterior perirenal space, appears

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  A 51-year-old man had PICC line placed through right
     basilic vein, which was an unable to be advanced the last 15 cm.  Now needs to
     reposition or change the PICC line.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2247**] [**Name (STitle) **] and Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 42**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 42**], the attending radiologist was present and supervising
     throughout the procedure.
     
     The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table.  The right arm and
     pre-existing PICC line were prepped and draped in the standard sterile
     fashion.  A 5 cc of 1% lidocaine was applied for local anesthesia. Fluoroscopy
     showed the tip of the catheter located in the right axillary vein.  A 4-
     French peel- away sheath was advanced over the preexisting PICC line after the
     PICC line was cut down. The PICC line was then removed. A 0.018 guidewire was
     advanced through the peel- away sheath with the tip in the superior vena cava
     under flouroscopic guidance . The length of the PICC line was measured at 51
     cm based on the mark on the wire.  After the inner dilator was removed, a
     double lumen PICC line was then placed over the wire with the tip in the
     superior vena cava. The peel- away sheath and the wire were removed.  Two
     lumens were flushed and the line was secured with skin with StatLock.  The
     patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate
     complications.
     
     IMPRESSION: Replacement of a 51 cm double-lumen PICC line through right
     basilic vein with the tip in the superior vena cava.  The line is ready to
     use.

     Right-sided chest tube and feeding tube are unchanged in position allowing for
     positional differences.  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  There is

     Small residual right pleural effusion, despite right pleural drain and
     atelectasis in adjacent lung are longstanding.  Mild pulmonary edema has not
     changed appreciably since [**5-31**] and the azygos vein is still distended

     INDICATION:  51-year-old with head and neck cancer, recent pancreatitis,
     presenting with acute shortness of breath, rule out PE and reassess abdominal
     collections.
     
     COMPARISONS:  CT torso of [**2596-5-31**].
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with oral and
     100 cc of nonionic Optiray contrast.
     
     CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  Right-sided chest tube remains in place.  There
     are bilateral pleural effusions, with persisting consolidation in the right
     lower lobe.  The mid and upper lung zones are clear.  The airway is patent to
     the segmental level.  The pulmonary arteries enhance normally without filling
     defect.  There are diffuse enlarged lymph nodes throughout the mediastinum,
     suspicious for metastatic nodes.  The thoracic aorta is normal in caliber and
     enhances normally.  Multiple small subcentimeter axillary nodes.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  Again demonstrated are multiple small thin-
     walled fluid collections throughout the abdomen, not significantly changed in
     size and appearance compared to the prior study.  None of these are large
     enough for safe percutaneous drainage.  The pancreatic parenchyma enhances
     homogeneously without evidence of significant necrosis or intraparenchymal
     abscess.  There are coarse calcifications along the duct near the pancreatic
     head, likely the sequela of chronic pancreatitis.  Moderate amount of ascites
     surrounding the liver and throughout the pelvis.  Small ill-defined hepatic
     hypodense lesion within segment VI, too small to characterize.  Additional
     tiny hypodense lesion in segment V anteriorly, too small to characterize as
     well.  Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.  The kidneys, adrenal
     glands, stomach, and proximal small bowel are normal.  The spleen contains an
     ill-defined lesion posteriorly, not well characterized on this study.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Large amount of ascites and free fluid in the
     pelvis.  Subcentimeter inguinal lymph nodes.  No pathologically enlarged lymph
     nodes are seen.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  2.5-cm ill-defined lytic lesion in the right iliac bone lateral
     to the SI joint, suspicious for metastasis.  Old right lateral rib fracture,
     demonstrating some callus formation.  No other suspicious lytic or blastic
     lesions.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  51-year-old with head and neck cancer, recent pancreatitis,
     presenting with acute shortness of breath, rule out PE and reassess abdominal
     collections.
     
     COMPARISONS:  CT torso of [**2596-5-31**].
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with oral and
     100 cc of nonionic Optiray contrast.
     
     CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  Right-sided chest tube remains in place.  There
     are bilateral pleural effusions, with persisting consolidation in the right
     lower lobe.  The mid and upper lung zones are clear.  The airway is patent to
     the segmental level.  The pulmonary arteries enhance normally without filling
     defect.  There are diffuse enlarged lymph nodes throughout the mediastinum,
     suspicious for metastatic nodes.  The thoracic aorta is normal in caliber and
     enhances normally.  Multiple small subcentimeter axillary nodes.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  Again demonstrated are multiple small thin-
     walled fluid collections throughout the abdomen, not significantly changed in
     size and appearance compared to the prior study.  None of these are large
     enough for safe percutaneous drainage.  The pancreatic parenchyma enhances
     homogeneously without evidence of significant necrosis or intraparenchymal
     abscess.  There are coarse calcifications along the duct near the pancreatic
     head, likely the sequela of chronic pancreatitis.  Moderate amount of ascites
     surrounding the liver and throughout the pelvis.  Small ill-defined hepatic
     hypodense lesion within segment VI, too small to characterize.  Additional
     tiny hypodense lesion in segment V anteriorly, too small to characterize as
     well.  Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.  The kidneys, adrenal
     glands, stomach, and proximal small bowel are normal.  The spleen contains an
     ill-defined lesion posteriorly, not well characterized on this study.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Large amount of ascites and free fluid in the
     pelvis.  Subcentimeter inguinal lymph nodes.  No pathologically enlarged lymph
     nodes are seen.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  2.5-cm ill-defined lytic lesion in the right iliac bone lateral
     to the SI joint, suspicious for metastasis.  Old right lateral rib fracture,
     demonstrating some callus formation.  No other suspicious lytic or blastic
     lesions.
                                                                 (Over)

     COMPARISON:  [**2596-6-6**].
     
     INDICATION:  Fever.
     
     Right PICC line and right chest tube are unchanged in position.  Cardiac and
     mediastinal contours show interval decrease in width, likely due to improving
     volume status of the patient.  There is also improvement in bilateral
     asymmetric perihilar and basilar alveolar process, particularly in the left
     perihilar region.  Although these opacities may in part be due to improving
     pulmonary edema,  underlying pneumonia is suspected, particularly in the lower
     lobes.  Moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged.

     INDICATION:  Followup right pleural effusion and pneumonia.
     
     FINDINGS:  Compared with [**2596-6-8**], there appears to have been some interval
     clearing/reexpansion of the right lower lobe collapse/consolidation with
     slightly improved lung volumes at the right base.
     
     The pleural effusion has probably increased slightly, and/or redistributed up
     along the right major fissure.
     
     Left lung remains grossly clear.
