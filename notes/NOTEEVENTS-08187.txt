HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69 year-old
male who was admitted [**2836-8-13**] for elective
catheterization after a positive exercise treadmill test.  He
was recently found to have two lung lesions and underwent a
preoperative stress test for thoracic surgery, which revealed
partially irreversible defects in the inferior and lateral
distribution.  The patient was admitted [**2836-8-13**] to the CMI
Service for elective cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Coronary artery disease status
post right coronary artery stent times three in [**2834**], status
post inferior myocardial infarction, V fibrillation arrest.
2.  Status post mitral valve endocarditis.  3.  History of
ejection fraction of 52%.  4.  History of subdural hematoma
after a motor vehicle accident in [**2833**].  5.  History of
transient ischemic attacks.  6.  History of GI bleed.  7.
Hypertension.  8.  Hypercholesterolemia.  9.  History of
splenic infarct.  10.  Gout.  11.  Prostate cancer.  12.
Left upper lobe and left lower lobe lung lesions suspect
primary tumors now preoperative for mediastinoscopy versus
thoracotomy for definitive diagnosis.

MEDICATIONS:  1.  Zestril 20 mg po q day.  2.  Lipitor 10 mg
po q.d.  3.  Norvasc 10 mg po q.d.  4.  Imdur 60 mg po q.d.
5.  Hormone injection q month.  6.  Lopressor 50 mg po b.i.d.
7.  Prilosec 20 mg po q.d.  8.  Terazosin 5 mg po q d.  9.
Aspirin 325 mg po q.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a forty pack year history of
smoking.  He drinks occasional alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs, heart rate 51.  Blood
pressure 145/70.  General appearance, the patient is awake,
alert and oriented, nontoxic appearing.  HEENT no
jugulovenous distention.  No carotid bruits.  Lungs clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular regular rate and
rhythm.  Normal S1 and S2.  No murmurs.  Abdomen soft,
nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities no peripheral edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient was
admitted [**2836-8-13**] for elective cardiac catheterization status
post positive exercise treadmill test.  Cardiac
catheterization revealed left ventricular ejection fraction
of 45% with inferior hypokinesis, left main coronary artery
had a 60 to 70% ulcerated distal stenosis, left anterior
descending artery with 40% mid stenosis.  Left circumflex
with 30% mid stenosis and right coronary artery subtotally
occluded.  The patient was considered to be a candidate for
coronary artery bypass graft given his three vessel disease,
but this option was not pursued given probably inoperable
lung cancer.  The patient was subsequently recathed on [**2836-8-15**]
for stent placement.  The right coronary artery underwent a
rotational arthrectomy followed by angioplasty.  Following
the angioplasty there was a 20% residual stenosis and
brachytherapy was subsequently utilized.  The left main and
obtuse marginal one were stented as were the left main left
anterior descending coronary artery with a 0% residual with
no left circumflex compromise.  An intra-aortic balloon pump
was utilized during repeat catheterization.  Post procedure
the patient experienced an episode of gross hematemesis.  A
nasogastric tube was inserted, which revealed greater then
300 cc of red clot immediately following insertion.  The tube
was subsequently removed secondary to patient discomfort.

The patient remained hemodynamically stable with a hematocrit
of 31.  The patient was transferred two units of packed red
blood cells and transferred briefly to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit where the Gastrointestinal Service performed an
upper endoscopy.  Upper endoscopy revealed erosions in the
mid third and lower third of the esophagus consistent with
grade 2 esophageal erosions, a hiatal hernia and an ulcer at
the GE junction with a visible tear, but no visible vessel
and significant blood in the stomach.  Integrilin was also
discontinued at the time of the hematemesis.  Following the
procedure the patient remained hemodynamically stable.  He
was noted to have a bilateral groin hematoma left greater
then right with no bruits and intact distal pulses.  He was
subsequently discharged on Plavix and aspirin.

2.  Gastrointestinal:  As noted above patient with post
catheterization hematemesis and esophagogastroduodenoscopy
revealed grade two esophageal erosions as well as an ulcer at
the GE junction.  The patient was placed on Protonix 40 mg
intravenous times 24 hours and then 40 mg po b.i.d.  The
patient's diet was gradually advanced.  Hematocrit remained
stable with no recurrent hemoptysis.  The patient was
discharged on Prevacid 30 mg po b.i.d. with plan for
gastrointestinal follow up for endoscopy in three months.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Three vessel disease status post stenting of the obtuse
marginal one, the left main and the left anterior descending
coronary artery as well as percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty with brachytherapy of the right coronary artery.
2.  Gastrointestinal bleed secondary to esophageal erosions
and GE junction ulcer in the setting of anticoagulation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  1.  Zestril 20 mg po q.d.  2.
Lipitor 10 mg po q.d.  3.  Norvasc 10 mg po q.d.  4.  Imdur
60 mg po q.d.  5.  Hormone injection q month.  6.  Lopressor
50 mg po b.i.d.  7.  Prilosec 20 mg po q.d.  8.  Terazosin 5
mg po q.d.  9.  Aspirin 325 mg po q.d.  10.  Plavix 75 mg po
q.d. times thirty days.  11.  Prevacid 30 mg po q.d.

DISCHARGE PLAN:  The patient is to follow up with
gastrointestinal for repeat endoscopy in three months.  The
patient will follow up with his primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 1010**].  The patient has a planned mediastinoscopy versus
thoracotomy for evaluation of lung lesions.
