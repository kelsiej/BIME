     HISTORY:  Change in mental status partially reversed with Narcan.
     
     COMPARISON: None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  The patient is positioned obliquely in the scanner.  There is a
     fluid density ovoid small lesion in the right cerebellar hemisphere probably
     representing prior infarct at that location.  There is prominence of the
     ventricles, in particular the third ventricle where there is a somewhat
     rounded configuration in the anterior recesses.  There is periventricular
     hypodensity in the white matter consistent with chronic microvascular
     infarction.  There is no major vascular territorial infarct.  There is no
     parenchymal or extra-axial hemorrhage.  There is no shift of normally midline
     structures or mass effect.  The [**Doctor Last Name 30**]-white distinction is otherwise preserved
     and the ventricles, cisterns and sulci are as above.
     
     There is increased density throughout the globe on the left with some probable
     areas of calcification, although the globe itself is normal in size and
     contour.  There is no lens identified.  This is of uncertain chronicity and
     significance.  The bones and visualized paranasal sinuses are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No intracranial hemorrhage.  Chronic microvascular infarction.
     Abnormal-appearing left globe may represent chronic changes.

     FINDINGS:  Doppler evaluation of the upper extremities was performed.  The
     right subclavian vein could not be identified, however, multiple superficial
     collaterals were seen, all indicative of subclavian vein occlusion.  The right
     IJ appears widely patent, as well as the left subclavian vein.  The left
     internal jugular vein was not assessed due to technical reasons (line in this
     location).
     
     Doppler evaluation shows monophasic waveforms diffusely on the left.  The ABI
     measurement on the left is non-obtainable due to vessel noncompressibility.
     Volume recordings demonstrate diffuse amplitude loss and waveform widening on
     the left with only 3 mm amplitude at the left metatarsal level.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Findings consistent with an occluded right subclavian vein; the right IJ,
     and left subclavian veins are patent.
     
     2) Left-sided aorto-iliac disease.  There is likely significant tibial

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  65 year-old female with end stage renal disease and recent
     tunnedled catheter removal.  Place temporary left internal jugular vein
     catheter.
     
     RADIOLOGIST:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1455**] [**Name (STitle) 843**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6**], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6**], the attending physician present and supervising.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE:  Informed and signed consent was obtained.  The patient
     was prepped and draped in a standard sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia to the
     left neck was applied using 1% Lidocaine.  Under ultrasonographic guidance,
     access to the left internal jugular vein was obtained with a 21 gauge needle.
     A 0.018 guidewire was advanced into the left internal jugular vein.  A 4.5-
     French sheath was then advanced over the guidewire into the left internal
     jugular vein.  A 0.035 angled glidewire could not be advanced easily through
     the SVC.  A hand injection venogram was then performed which demonstrated
     tight stenosis at the junction of the left brachiocephalic vein adjacent to
     the right brachiocephalic vein.  The entry site at the left internal jugular
     vein was then dilated with two successive dilators.  A 14-French peelaway
     sheath was then advanced to the left internal jugular vein.  A 1 cm x 2 cm
     balloon was then advanced over a stiff Amplatz 0.035 guidewire. Balloon
     angioplasty of this area of stenosis at the left brachiocephalic vein was then
     performed.  The peel-away sheath was advanced to the area of stenosis.  The 20
     cm [**Last Name (un) 3722**] hemodialysis catheter was then advanced over the stiff Amplatz wire
     until the tip reached the mid-right atrium using flouroscopic guidance.  The
     peelaway sheath was removed. The catheter was flushed and both ports
     demonstrated good blood flow. A final chest x-ray showed the tip of the
     catheter within the mid- right atrium. The line was fixed to the skin with a
     statlock.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  Local anesthesia with 1% Lidocaine.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  65 year-old female with end stage renal disease and recent
     tunnedled catheter removal.  Place temporary left internal jugular vein
     catheter.
     
     RADIOLOGIST:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1455**] [**Name (STitle) 843**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6**], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6**], the attending physician present and supervising.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE:  Informed and signed consent was obtained.  The patient
     was prepped and draped in a standard sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia to the
     left neck was applied using 1% Lidocaine.  Under ultrasonographic guidance,
     access to the left internal jugular vein was obtained with a 21 gauge needle.
     A 0.018 guidewire was advanced into the left internal jugular vein.  A 4.5-
     French sheath was then advanced over the guidewire into the left internal
     jugular vein.  A 0.035 angled glidewire could not be advanced easily through
     the SVC.  A hand injection venogram was then performed which demonstrated
     tight stenosis at the junction of the left brachiocephalic vein adjacent to
     the right brachiocephalic vein.  The entry site at the left internal jugular
     vein was then dilated with two successive dilators.  A 14-French peelaway
     sheath was then advanced to the left internal jugular vein.  A 1 cm x 2 cm
     balloon was then advanced over a stiff Amplatz 0.035 guidewire. Balloon
     angioplasty of this area of stenosis at the left brachiocephalic vein was then
     performed.  The peel-away sheath was advanced to the area of stenosis.  The 20
     cm [**Last Name (un) 3722**] hemodialysis catheter was then advanced over the stiff Amplatz wire
     until the tip reached the mid-right atrium using flouroscopic guidance.  The
     peelaway sheath was removed. The catheter was flushed and both ports
     demonstrated good blood flow. A final chest x-ray showed the tip of the
     catheter within the mid- right atrium. The line was fixed to the skin with a
     statlock.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  Local anesthesia with 1% Lidocaine.
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  65 year-old female with end stage renal disease and recent
     tunnedled catheter removal.  Place temporary left internal jugular vein
     catheter.
     
     RADIOLOGIST:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1455**] [**Name (STitle) 843**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6**], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6**], the attending physician present and supervising.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE:  Informed and signed consent was obtained.  The patient
     was prepped and draped in a standard sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia to the
     left neck was applied using 1% Lidocaine.  Under ultrasonographic guidance,
     access to the left internal jugular vein was obtained with a 21 gauge needle.
     A 0.018 guidewire was advanced into the left internal jugular vein.  A 4.5-
     French sheath was then advanced over the guidewire into the left internal
     jugular vein.  A 0.035 angled glidewire could not be advanced easily through
     the SVC.  A hand injection venogram was then performed which demonstrated
     tight stenosis at the junction of the left brachiocephalic vein adjacent to
     the right brachiocephalic vein.  The entry site at the left internal jugular
     vein was then dilated with two successive dilators.  A 14-French peelaway
     sheath was then advanced to the left internal jugular vein.  A 1 cm x 2 cm
     balloon was then advanced over a stiff Amplatz 0.035 guidewire. Balloon
     angioplasty of this area of stenosis at the left brachiocephalic vein was then
     performed.  The peel-away sheath was advanced to the area of stenosis.  The 20
     cm [**Last Name (un) 3722**] hemodialysis catheter was then advanced over the stiff Amplatz wire
     until the tip reached the mid-right atrium using flouroscopic guidance.  The
     peelaway sheath was removed. The catheter was flushed and both ports
     demonstrated good blood flow. A final chest x-ray showed the tip of the
     catheter within the mid- right atrium. The line was fixed to the skin with a
     statlock.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  Local anesthesia with 1% Lidocaine.
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  65 year-old female with end stage renal disease and recent
     tunnedled catheter removal.  Place temporary left internal jugular vein
     catheter.
     
     RADIOLOGIST:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1455**] [**Name (STitle) 843**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6**], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6**], the attending physician present and supervising.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE:  Informed and signed consent was obtained.  The patient
     was prepped and draped in a standard sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia to the
     left neck was applied using 1% Lidocaine.  Under ultrasonographic guidance,
     access to the left internal jugular vein was obtained with a 21 gauge needle.
     A 0.018 guidewire was advanced into the left internal jugular vein.  A 4.5-
     French sheath was then advanced over the guidewire into the left internal
     jugular vein.  A 0.035 angled glidewire could not be advanced easily through
     the SVC.  A hand injection venogram was then performed which demonstrated
     tight stenosis at the junction of the left brachiocephalic vein adjacent to
     the right brachiocephalic vein.  The entry site at the left internal jugular
     vein was then dilated with two successive dilators.  A 14-French peelaway
     sheath was then advanced to the left internal jugular vein.  A 1 cm x 2 cm
     balloon was then advanced over a stiff Amplatz 0.035 guidewire. Balloon
     angioplasty of this area of stenosis at the left brachiocephalic vein was then
     performed.  The peel-away sheath was advanced to the area of stenosis.  The 20
     cm [**Last Name (un) 3722**] hemodialysis catheter was then advanced over the stiff Amplatz wire
     until the tip reached the mid-right atrium using flouroscopic guidance.  The
     peelaway sheath was removed. The catheter was flushed and both ports
     demonstrated good blood flow. A final chest x-ray showed the tip of the
     catheter within the mid- right atrium. The line was fixed to the skin with a
     statlock.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  Local anesthesia with 1% Lidocaine.
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 65 year old woman with end stage renal disease and recent tunnel
     catheter removed on [**7-26**] due to infection. She has a temporary left
     internal jugular catheter in place. Please tunnel this for more permanent
     access.
     
     PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3726**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3727**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 505**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 400**]
     the attending radiologist present and supervising. Informed consent was
     obtained from the patient. This was done verbally since she is blind and the
     patient's nurse signed the consent form as the witness.
     
     The left upper chest was prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion. A
     0.35 guidewire was placed through the existing 20 cm temporary dialysis line.
     Using the wire, a length estimate was obtained and it was deemed that a 27 cm
     tip to cuff tunneled dialysis line would be appropriate. Then a site on the
     upper left chest was selected and the tunnel was made using a blunt 21 gauge
     [**Last Name (un) 514**] needle after administration of 15 cc of 1% lidocaine for local
     anesthesia. The new dialysis catheter was fed through the tunnel and the
     existing temporary catheter was exchanged for a 14.5 french peel away sheath
     using flouroscopic guidance. There was some resistance in placing the sheath
     within the brachiocephalic vein, and two peel-away sheaths had to be used
     because of crimping.  A 0.35 glidewire was used to guide the sheath into the
     IVC. The inner dilator was removed and the dialysis catheter was fed through
     the 14 french peel away sheath with its tip with the proximal right atrium wit
     ha glide wire in place. The tunnel site at the chest was secured with a stat
     lock and a small vicryl suture was placed at the site of the prior temporary
     dialysis catheter to prevent slipping of the cuff. There was a small amount of
     oozing from the site after the procedure and a pressure dressing was applied.
     
     FINDINGS: A final chest x-ray was obtained which demonstrates the tip of the
     catheter in the proximal atrium. The line is ready for use.
     
     IMPRESSION: Tunneling of the previously existing left internal jugular
     dialysis catheter. There is stenosis in the distal left brachiocephalic vein
     which the catheter crosses.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION: Severe PVD, ESRD, with history of infected right graft which was
     removed at an outside hospital.  The patient is bacteremic, evaluate for a
     fluid collection in the right thigh.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained from the lower pelvis
     through the knees without intravenous contrast.  No IV contrast was
     administered secondary to the patient's elevated creatinine.  Coronal and
     sagittal reformations were performed.
     
     FINDINGS: There are extensive vascular calcifications.  There are no focal
     fluid collections identified within the right thigh or elsewhere.  There is
     inflammatory stranding within the anterior subcutaneous tissues of the right
     thigh, which may relate to recent surgery in this region.  The patient is S/P
     right below the knee amputation.
     
     The left rectus abdominis muscle is diminutive compared with the right.  Oral
     contrast is identified within the sigmoid colon and rectum. There is
     thickening of the left lateral wall of the rectum.  In retrospect, this is
     probably present on the prior CT of the abdomen and pelvis from [**2973-7-26**]
     but was not as well evaluated without oral contrast in this region.  There is
     a prominent left femoral lymph node, which measures 15 mm in short axis.
     
     There are bilateral knee effusions, slightly larger on the left than the
     right.  The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  No evidence for a focal fluid collection within the right
     thigh, though this evaluation is somewhat limited without intravenous
     contrast.
     2)  Thickening of the wall of the rectum on the left.  A neoplastic process
     cannot be excluded.  Correlation with endoscopy is recommended.
     3)  Prominent left femoral lymph node.

     PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3726**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3727**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 505**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 400**]
     the attending radiologist present and supervising. Informed consent was
     obtained from the patient. This was done verbally since she is blind and the
     patient's nurse signed the consent form as the witness.
     
     The left upper chest was prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion. A
     0.35 guidewire was placed through the existing 20 cm temporary dialysis line.
     Using the wire, a length estimate was obtained and it was deemed that a 27 cm
     tip to cuff tunneled dialysis line would be appropriate. Then a site on the
     upper left chest was selected and the tunnel was made using a blunt 21 gauge
     [**Last Name (un) 514**] needle after administration of 15 cc of 1% lidocaine for local
     anesthesia. The new dialysis catheter was fed through the tunnel and the
     existing temporary catheter was exchanged for a 14.5 french peel away sheath
     using flouroscopic guidance. There was some resistance in placing the sheath
     within the brachiocephalic vein, and two peel-away sheaths had to be used
     because of crimping.  A 0.35 glidewire was used to guide the sheath into the
     IVC. The inner dilator was removed and the dialysis catheter was fed through
     the 14 french peel away sheath with its tip with the proximal right atrium wit
     ha glide wire in place. The tunnel site at the chest was secured with a stat
     lock and a small vicryl suture was placed at the site of the prior temporary
     dialysis catheter to prevent slipping of the cuff. There was a small amount of
     oozing from the site after the procedure and a pressure dressing was applied.
     
     FINDINGS: A final chest x-ray was obtained which demonstrates the tip of the
     catheter in the proximal atrium. The line is ready for use.
     
     IMPRESSION: Tunneling of the previously existing left internal jugular
     dialysis catheter. There is stenosis in the distal left brachiocephalic vein
     which the catheter crosses.

     This appearance is consistent with past trauma. There is also an area of
     increased density in the posterolateral right globe consistent with possible
     retinal detachment and hemorrhage.  Much less likely, this appearance could
     suggest melanoma in the appropriate clinical setting.
     
     The osseous structures, soft tissues, and paranasal sinuses are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or territorial
     infarction.
     2)  Chronic changes in the left globe which may suggest past trauma.
     3)  Area of increased density in the right lateral retina which suggests
     retinal detachment with hemorrhage.  For follow up, an [**Hospital Unit Name 115**] examination is
     recommended.

     COMPARISON:  [**2973-7-26**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiple axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained
     following the administartion of non-ionic IV contrast.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The lung bases demonstrate some minimal
     bilateral atelectasis.  There is a small pericardial effusion.  The liver,
     gallbladder, pancreas, and adrenal glands are unremarkable.  Both kidneys are
     atrophic.  There are numerous cysts present in both kidneys, unchanged.  The
     spleen is unremarkable with the exception of a small 1.5 cm low attenuation
     lesion.  This could represent a cyst or a hemangioma and is unchanged from the
     prior study of [**2973-7-26**].  There is no free air or free fluid in the

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Please evaluate for PE.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  A 64-year-old with left-sided pleuritic chest pain and
     hypotension.  Assess for pulmonary embolus.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT of the chest with and without IV contrast.  100 cc of Optiray
     were used for this examination due to the need for fast bolus technique.
     Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.
     
     No prior studies for comparison.
     
     FINDINGS:  Soft tissue window images reveal small bilateral pleural effusions.
     There are several scattered non-pathologically-enlarged mediastinal and
     prevascular lymph nodes.  There is no significant hilar or axillary lymph
     adenopathy.  The heart is slightly enlarged.  There is a pericardial effusion
     which measures about 1.6 cm in greatest dimension.  A left-sided Port-A-Cath
     is in place with its tip terminating in the right atrium.  Lung window images
     reveal minor atelectatic changes at both lung bases.  There are no focal
     consolidations or nodules.  There is no pneumothorax.
     
     CT angiogram demonstrates no pulmonary embolus.  The aorta is calcified, but
     normal in caliber with no evidence of aneurysmal dilation or dissection.
     
     Images of the upper abdomen reveal calcifications in the splenic and celiac
     arteries. The upper abdomen is otherwise unremarkable. The osseous structures
     demonstrate degenerative changes throughout the thoracic spine.  The soft
     tissues are normal.
     
     Coronal and sagittal reformatted images confirm the above findings.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     No evidence of pulmonary embolus.  Small pericardial effusion.  Small
     bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectatic changes.

     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Status post left AKA, now with bacteremia, evaluate for
     osteomyelitis.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Coronal T1, STIR, axial T1, STIR, and post contrast fat saturated
     T1W imaging was performed.  The most recent prior examination, a CT scan of
     the lower extremity dated [**2973-8-3**], is retrieved for correlation.
     
     Since the prior examination the patient has undergone a left above the knee
     amputation.  Evaluation of the hips on this examination is limited due to the
     field of view.  However, there is no evidence of a hip effusion.  Signal
     arising from within the bone marrow is within normal limits.  There is no
     evidence of an intraosseous abscess.  There is diffuse edema within the vastus
     lateralis of the left leg and quadriceps of the right.  No discrete fluid
     collections are identified.  On post contrast imaging no focal enhancing
     collections are present either.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Status post left above the knee amputation.  Diffuse edema is present within
     the quadriceps muscles on the right and vastus lateralis on the left.  No
     intraosseous abscess or drainable soft tissue collection is identified.

     INDICATION:  65 year old female with desaturation with fever.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
     
     Comparison is made with the previous chest radiographs dated [**11-3**] and
     20, 2004.
     
     FINDINGS:  The study is somewhat limited due to under penetration with
     overlying soft tissue. The central venous line is unchanged compared to the
     previous study. Again note is made of mild cardiomegaly. Thoracic aorta is
     tortuous. Again note is made of stent in the right axillary, subclavian, and
     brachiocephalic vessels. Opacification of the left lower lobe is noted, most
     likely related to the posteriorly located density noted on the lateral view,
     which is increased compared to the prior study. No evidence of CHF is noted.
     Continued plate-like atelectasis in bilateral lungs.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Increase of left lower lobe opacity, which can represent
     atelectasis of pneumonia, or pleural density. Please correlate clinically.
