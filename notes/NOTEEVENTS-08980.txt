STUDIES:
[**2619-1-8**] Abdominal aortogram with right lower extremity runoff.
ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:  The abdominal aorta is extremely 
angulated but smooth. There were patent bilateral common, 
internal and external iliac arteries. The renal arteries and 
single and patent bilaterally. The right lower extremity shows a 
patent common femoral artery, profunda femoral artery and 
superficial femoral artery, popliteal, anterior tibialis and 
peroneal arteries. The PT is occluded and both the AT and the 
peroneal arteries occlude at the ankle. There were vessels seen 
in the foot.
SUMMARY:  Either thrombosis or embolism of the right foot 
arteries. Nonviable foot. Will likely need a right below knee 
amputation.
.
[**1-13**] CT abd/pelvis:  There is free fluid in the pelvis. There is 
dilatation of bowel loops with a maximum of 7 cm in diameter. 
.
[**1-16**] CTA abd/pelvis: 
1.A slight interval increase in size in the bilateral pleural 
effusions and adjacent consolidation/atelectasis.
2.The aorta is normal in caliber, all its main branches are 
widely patent.
3. Hypodense areas in both lobe of the thyroid gland.
4. Mild cardiomegaly.
5. Cholelithiasis.
6. Splenic and cortical renal infarcts.
7. Ascites.
.
Pathology: Ileocolectomy:
Acute hemorrhagic infarction involving the mucosa of the cecum 
and colon.
The infarction extends in the mucosa to the proximal ileal 
margin.
.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known patient lastname 12541**] was admitted to vascular surgery service with 
gangrene of the right foot that was likely secondary to 
thrombosis or embolism of the right foot arteries, as confirmed 
by angiography. As she was not a candidate for 
revascularization, she was prepped for right below knee 
amputation. She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics. Given 
the patient's poor nutritional status, MIS surgery was consulted 
regarding PEG placement at the time of amputation. The patient 
underwent above knee amputation of the right extremity by 
vascular surgery and PEG placement by MIS surgery on [**2619-1-12**]. 
Please see operative report for full details. 
.
On post-operative day #1, the patient complained of abdominal 
pain. Initially, this was not associated with peritoneal signs 
and the patient underwent CT scan evaluation. This revealed some 
free air and ascites. Subsequent exam of the patient did reveal 
abdominal distention and peritoneal signs that were associated 
with elevation in WBC and decreased urine output. As a result, 
the patient was taken to the OR for exploratory laparotomy on 
[**2619-1-13**]. Please see operative report for full details.
.
In the OR, the patient was found to have ischemic colon without 
frank perforation extending from the cecum to the end of the 
descending colon. SHe underwent extended R colectomy and end 
ileostomy. She was transferred to the SICU for care.  
.
In the SICU, the patient received IV antibiotics. In the week 
following admission, the patient remained intubated but appeared 
to be improving slowly. THe patient was extubated on [**2619-1-17**] 
with a functioning ostomy. The following day, however, the 
patient developed blood per rectum. This was associated with a 
fall in her hematocrit. On [**2619-1-20**], the patient was taken back 
to the OR for exploratory laparotomy. In the OR, 46 cm of 
necrotic and ischemic bowel was found. The patient underwent 
resection of small intesting as well as ileostomy. Please see 
operative report for full details.
.
Post-operatively, the patient underwent extensive 
hypercoagulable work-up and was found to be HIT positive. She 
was started on Agastroband. On [**2619-1-24**], a code was called on the 
patient for pulseless electrical activity secondary to 
respiratory distress. She was re-intubated and resuscitated 
successfully. A family meeting was held on [**2619-1-26**] at which time 
her code status was changed from full code to DNR/DNI (if 
successfully extubated). After several days, as the patient was 
not tolerating extubation, the patient's code status was 
discussed again with the family. On [**2619-1-29**], the patient was made 
comfort measures only and she expired at 13:47 on that same day.

     INDICATION:  Abdominal pain after G-tube placement with abdominal distention.
     
     COMPARISONS:  No prior studies are available for comparison on PACS.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired axial images from the lung bases to the pubic
     symphysis were acquired without intravenous contrast, multiplanar reformations
     were performed.  CT of the abdomen:  There are bibasilar pleural effusions and
     lung consolidation on the left posterior base.
     
     There is ascites seen around abdominal organs tracking down into the pelvis.
     There is significant intrahepatic biliary dilatation.  There is
     cholelithiasis, without evidence of cholecystitis.  No focal liver lesions are
     seen on this limited unenhanced scan.  There are hypoattenuating lesions in
     the spleen, too small to characterize.  The kidneys, adrenal glands, and
     pancreas appear grossly normal on this limited study.  There is only minimal
     amount of contrast in the GI tract; the G-tube appears in satisfactory
     position in the stomach, there is no surrounding hematoma.  There is vascular
     calcification and tortuosity in the abdominal aorta.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There is free fluid in the pelvis.  There
     is dilatation of bowel loops with a maximum of 7 cm in diameter.  The bladder
     is unremarkable.  There are calcifications in the region of the right external
     iliac artery suggestive of aneurysmal dilatation in that area, however, on
     this noncontrast study this is difficult to evaluate. There is a significant
     amount of anasarca.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are degenerative changes in the lumbar spine.  No
     suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
     
     REFORMATIONS:  The multiplanar reformations were helpful in delineating the
     anatomy and pathology.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     PROCEDURE:  CT torso.
     
     HISTORY:  81-year-old woman with necrotic bowel S/P exploratory laparotomy.
     Please assess aorta.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT images of the thorax without contrast were first
     obtained, followed by continuous axial images with IV contrast of the chest,
     abdomen, and pelvis.
     
     Comparison is made with prior study dated [**2619-1-13**].
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     CHEST CT WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There has been mild interval increase in
     the bilateral pleural effusions.  There is associated adjacent bibasal
     atelectasis.  Bronchiectasis are seen in both upper lungs.  The airways are
     patent, endotracheal tube is seen in adequate position.  There are no
     mediastinal or axillary pathologically enlarged lymph nodes.  There is mild
     cardiomegaly.
     
     The aorta is normal in caliber, the main branches are widely patent.
     
     Small hypodense areas are seen in both lobes of the thyroid gland.
     
     ABDOMEN CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  Given the single early arterial phase, the
     liver, pancreas, and adrenals are unremarkable.  Multiple peripheral wedge-
     shaped areas are seen in the spleen and in the cortical regions of both
     kidneys consistent with areas of infarcts.  There is no hydronephrosis.  Tiny
     multiple stones are seen within the gallbladder lumen.  There is moderate
     ascites.  The G-tube appears in satisfactory position.
     
     The aorta is normal in caliber.  The main branches (celiac axis, SMA, [**Female First Name (un) **], and
     renal arteries) are widely patent.
     
     The small bowel loops are unremarkable.
     
     PELVIC CT:  There is moderate quantity of free fluid.  The bowel loops are
     unremarkable.  The bladder has a Foley catheter in its lumen.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     STUDY:  AP chest performed on [**2619-1-17**].
     
     HISTORY:  81-year-old woman with intubation.  Patient with bilateral pleural
     effusions.  Considering extubation.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to the prior chest radiograph of [**2618-1-13**], and chest CT from [**2619-1-16**].
     
     There is an endotracheal tube whose tip is at the level of the aorta.  There
     is a right-sided central venous catheter with distal tip in the distal SVC.
     The nasogastric tube has been removed.  Study is slightly limited secondary to
     increased opacity within the right lung secondary to the patient's many skin
     folds.  There is no evidence for pneumothorax.  There is again seen bilateral
     pleural effusions with a left retrocardiac opacity.  This is unchanged.
     Pulmonary vascular markings are slightly prominent without evidence for overt
     pulmonary edema.
