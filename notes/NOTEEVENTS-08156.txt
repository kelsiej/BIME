Pertinent Results:
CXR - Findings consistent with CHF, although underlying 
bilateral lower lobe pneumonias cannot be excluded. Follow up.
.
[**6-14**] ECG -  Regular tachycardia - may be sinus tachycardia but 
consider also atrial tachycardia. Left ventricular hypertrophy 
by voltage. Poor R wave progression could be due in part to left 
ventricular hypertrophy, but consider also anteroseptal 
myocardial infarction of indeterminate age. Clinical correlation 
is suggested. No previous tracing available for comparison 
.
[**6-16**] ECG - Baseline artifact. Narrow complex tachycardia may be 
atrial flutter or fibrillation, but baseline artifact makes 
assessment difficult. Left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage. 
Poor R wave progression could be due in part to left ventricular 
hypertrophy, but consider also anteroseptal myocardial 
infarction of indeterminate age. Anterolateral ST-T wave 
abnormalities. Cannot exclude ischemia. Clinical correlation is 
suggested. Since the previous tracing of [**2533-6-15**] sinus rhythm is 
now absent. 
. 
[**6-15**] TTE - mild LVH. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. 
There is mild global  left ventricular hypokinesis (lateral 
basal segments contract best). Overall  left ventricular 
systolic function is mildly depressed. Right ventricular chamber 
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is 
moderately  dilated. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. 
The aortic valve leaflets  are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] 
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
CHF - the patient was found to be fluid overloaded on CXR.  This 
was attributed to his tachycardia and hypertension.  He was give 
IV lasix in the ED.  The patient was rate controlled with a beta 
blocker.  Once his electrolytes stabilized he was started on an 
ACE inhibitor.  TTE was obtained and showed global hypokinesis 
with an EF of 40-45%.  Outside hospital records were obtained 
and the patient's EF was found to be at baseline.  Cardiac 
enzymes were cycled x3.  The patient's troponin was elevated in 
the setting of his renal failure, however; his CK's were found 
to be negative.  Once his tachycardia and BP were controlled the 
patient was weaned from a NRB to a nasal cannula.  He was 
eventually d/c on room air.  
.
Pneumonia - The patient presented with a fever to 101.6, wbc of 
17.2, and questionable b/l pneumonia on cxr.  He was initially 
started on levaquin, ceftazadime, and vancomycin.  Upon transfer 
to the floor the patient was maintained on levaquin which was 
dosed every other day in light of his renal failure.  He was d/c 
to home with treatment for a total of 14 days.  
.
Tachycardia - cardiology consult was called to address the 
patient's SVT.  Based on their initial assessment, they felt his 
rhythm may have been in atrial flutter that eventually 
transitioned to atrial tachycardia vs. sinus tachycardia.  They 
recommended rate control with an IV beta blocker to keep the 
patient HR < 100.  It was felt that his ECG changes represented 
his recent completed anteroeptal MI and cardaic catheterization 
was deferred.  Upon transfer to the floor the patient had 
several episodes where he was tachycardic to the 120's.  He was 
treated with IV beta blocker.  It appeared by ECG and telemetry 
that the patient was in atrial fibrillation though it was not 
completely clear.  His heart rate eventually responded to 
titration of his oral beta blocker.  He was eventually d/c to 
home with 300 mg of Toprol XL every day.

Shortness of Breath: the patient's shortness of was attributed 
to 1) fluid overload from tachycardia and hypertension 2) 
possible pneumonia based on fever, leukocytosis, and 
questionable opacities on CXR.  The patient was Pt white count 
and O2 sat stable  
- cont levofloxacin q 48 in light of pt renal function  
- continue nebs  
- prn lasix for fluid overload  
.
ESRD - The patient was seen by the renal service and underwent 
dialysis on two occassions.    
.
Dementia - the patient was often agitated on the floor.  He 
required a 1:1 sitter and occasional haldol for sedation.  Per 
his wife the patient had done poorly in the hospital in the 
past.  She felt his behavior was not out of the ordinary.  His 
MS slightly improved with treatment of infection though he was 
never completely lucid.  Per conversation with the patient's 
wife and PCP the patient functions much better in his home 
environment.  Per the wishes of his wife he was d/c's to home 
with VNA.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      75 year old man with ESRD and ? of venous outflow stenosis, cannot cannulate 
      venous limb of AVG.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Pt. has a L upper arm AV graft that has a bruit and thrill but HD staff cannot 
      place a venous needle. AV graft has had many revisions, goes from antecubital 
      to axilla. Staff can cannulate for the arterial needle in the antecubital but 
      no flow from needles further up the venous limb of the graft. Pt. needs a 
      fistulagram, ? venous outflow stenosis.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: This is a 75-year-old man with end-stage renal disease and difficulty
     cannulating the venous limb of his hemodialysis arteriovenous (AV) fistula.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 4385**] [**Name (STitle) 42**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 5263**]
     [**Doctor Last Name 43**] d'Othee. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 43**] [**Name (STitle) 44**] the attending radiologist was present and
     supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     CONSENT: After receiving explanation of the benefits and risks of the
     procedure written informed consent was obtained from the patient.
     
     TECHNIQUE: The patient was placed supine on the angiography table. After local
     anesthesia with 3 cc of Lidocaine 1%, access was gained to the outflow tract
     of the left arm AV fistula with a 21 gauge needle, close to the elbow. A 0.018
     guidewire was advanced through the needle into the fistula and the needle was
     exchanged for a 4 French micropuncture sheath. An AV fistulogram was obtained.
     It showed a few areas of moderate stenosis in the outflow tract of the fistula
     close to the arterial anastomosis. No other areas of significant stenosis were
     seen in the outflow tract up to the superior vena cava. With an inflated arm
     cuff, a new contrast angiogram was obtained to opacify the arterial
     anastomosis and inflow. No signs of inflow problems were visualized.
     
     Based on the findings of the fistulogram, a decision was then made to dilate
     the areas of venous stenosis in the distal third of the arm. This was done
     with a 5 mm angioplasty balloon followed by a new fistulogram which showed
     partial angiographic improvement. Then, decision was made to advance a 6 mm
     balloon for new angioplasty. This was successfully performed under
     fluoroscopic guidance and a final fistulogram was obtained. It showed good
     improvement of flow and opening of the stenosed areas.
     
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     (Cont)
     Of note, the patient presents, close to the AV anastomosis, an early
     bifurcation of the main outflow vein. The lateral limb of this bifurcation
     ends early as a short blind conduit that looks like an old outflow vein that
     is now occluded and therefore presents a pulse but no thrill. The medial limb
     of the bifurcation constitutes the main venous outflow of the fistula and
     presents good thrill along the medial aspect of the peripheral half of the
     arm. As the patient had been dialyzed at an outside facility so far, and in
     order to avoid possible confusion and erroneous access into the pulsatile,
     lateral venous limb, the medial limb was marked with Steri-Strips for future
     access before being sent to the Dialysis Unit. The dialysis unit staff was
     informed by phone to attempt access in this medial, thrilling limb only.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: There were no immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  AV fistulogram showing moderate areas of stenosis in the proximal outflow
     tract of the AV fistula.
     
     2.  Successful dilation of the stenosed areas with 5 and 6 mm angioplasty
     balloons.
     
     3.  Recommend to attempt future hemodialysis access only in the thrilling vein
     palpable on the medial aspect of the left arm, not in the pulsatile vein on
     the lateral aspect of the distal arm.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      75 year old man with ESRD and ? of venous outflow stenosis, cannot cannulate 
      venous limb of AVG.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Pt. has a L upper arm AV graft that has a bruit and thrill but HD staff cannot 
      place a venous needle. AV graft has had many revisions, goes from antecubital 
      to axilla. Staff can cannulate for the arterial needle in the antecubital but 
      no flow from needles further up the venous limb of the graft. Pt. needs a 
      fistulagram, ? venous outflow stenosis.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: This is a 75-year-old man with end-stage renal disease and difficulty
     cannulating the venous limb of his hemodialysis arteriovenous (AV) fistula.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 4385**] [**Name (STitle) 42**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 5263**]
     [**Doctor Last Name 43**] d'Othee. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 43**] [**Name (STitle) 44**] the attending radiologist was present and
     supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     CONSENT: After receiving explanation of the benefits and risks of the
     procedure written informed consent was obtained from the patient.
     
     TECHNIQUE: The patient was placed supine on the angiography table. After local
     anesthesia with 3 cc of Lidocaine 1%, access was gained to the outflow tract
     of the left arm AV fistula with a 21 gauge needle, close to the elbow. A 0.018
     guidewire was advanced through the needle into the fistula and the needle was
     exchanged for a 4 French micropuncture sheath. An AV fistulogram was obtained.
     It showed a few areas of moderate stenosis in the outflow tract of the fistula
     close to the arterial anastomosis. No other areas of significant stenosis were
     seen in the outflow tract up to the superior vena cava. With an inflated arm
     cuff, a new contrast angiogram was obtained to opacify the arterial
     anastomosis and inflow. No signs of inflow problems were visualized.
     
     Based on the findings of the fistulogram, a decision was then made to dilate
     the areas of venous stenosis in the distal third of the arm. This was done
     with a 5 mm angioplasty balloon followed by a new fistulogram which showed
     partial angiographic improvement. Then, decision was made to advance a 6 mm
     balloon for new angioplasty. This was successfully performed under
     fluoroscopic guidance and a final fistulogram was obtained. It showed good
     improvement of flow and opening of the stenosed areas.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     Of note, the patient presents, close to the AV anastomosis, an early
     bifurcation of the main outflow vein. The lateral limb of this bifurcation
     ends early as a short blind conduit that looks like an old outflow vein that
     is now occluded and therefore presents a pulse but no thrill. The medial limb
     of the bifurcation constitutes the main venous outflow of the fistula and
     presents good thrill along the medial aspect of the peripheral half of the
     arm. As the patient had been dialyzed at an outside facility so far, and in
     order to avoid possible confusion and erroneous access into the pulsatile,
     lateral venous limb, the medial limb was marked with Steri-Strips for future
     access before being sent to the Dialysis Unit. The dialysis unit staff was
     informed by phone to attempt access in this medial, thrilling limb only.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: There were no immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  AV fistulogram showing moderate areas of stenosis in the proximal outflow
     tract of the AV fistula.
     
     2.  Successful dilation of the stenosed areas with 5 and 6 mm angioplasty
     balloons.
     
     3.  Recommend to attempt future hemodialysis access only in the thrilling vein
     palpable on the medial aspect of the left arm, not in the pulsatile vein on
     the lateral aspect of the distal arm.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      75 year old man with ESRD and ? of venous outflow stenosis, cannot cannulate 
      venous limb of AVG.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Pt. has a L upper arm AV graft that has a bruit and thrill but HD staff cannot 
      place a venous needle. AV graft has had many revisions, goes from antecubital 
      to axilla. Staff can cannulate for the arterial needle in the antecubital but 
      no flow from needles further up the venous limb of the graft. Pt. needs a 
      fistulagram, ? venous outflow stenosis.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: This is a 75-year-old man with end-stage renal disease and difficulty
     cannulating the venous limb of his hemodialysis arteriovenous (AV) fistula.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 4385**] [**Name (STitle) 42**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 5263**]
     [**Doctor Last Name 43**] d'Othee. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 43**] [**Name (STitle) 44**] the attending radiologist was present and
     supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     CONSENT: After receiving explanation of the benefits and risks of the
     procedure written informed consent was obtained from the patient.
     
     TECHNIQUE: The patient was placed supine on the angiography table. After local
     anesthesia with 3 cc of Lidocaine 1%, access was gained to the outflow tract
     of the left arm AV fistula with a 21 gauge needle, close to the elbow. A 0.018
     guidewire was advanced through the needle into the fistula and the needle was
     exchanged for a 4 French micropuncture sheath. An AV fistulogram was obtained.
     It showed a few areas of moderate stenosis in the outflow tract of the fistula
     close to the arterial anastomosis. No other areas of significant stenosis were
     seen in the outflow tract up to the superior vena cava. With an inflated arm
     cuff, a new contrast angiogram was obtained to opacify the arterial
     anastomosis and inflow. No signs of inflow problems were visualized.
     
     Based on the findings of the fistulogram, a decision was then made to dilate
     the areas of venous stenosis in the distal third of the arm. This was done
     with a 5 mm angioplasty balloon followed by a new fistulogram which showed
     partial angiographic improvement. Then, decision was made to advance a 6 mm
     balloon for new angioplasty. This was successfully performed under
     fluoroscopic guidance and a final fistulogram was obtained. It showed good
     improvement of flow and opening of the stenosed areas.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     Of note, the patient presents, close to the AV anastomosis, an early
     bifurcation of the main outflow vein. The lateral limb of this bifurcation
     ends early as a short blind conduit that looks like an old outflow vein that
     is now occluded and therefore presents a pulse but no thrill. The medial limb
     of the bifurcation constitutes the main venous outflow of the fistula and
     presents good thrill along the medial aspect of the peripheral half of the
     arm. As the patient had been dialyzed at an outside facility so far, and in
     order to avoid possible confusion and erroneous access into the pulsatile,
     lateral venous limb, the medial limb was marked with Steri-Strips for future
     access before being sent to the Dialysis Unit. The dialysis unit staff was
     informed by phone to attempt access in this medial, thrilling limb only.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: There were no immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  AV fistulogram showing moderate areas of stenosis in the proximal outflow
     tract of the AV fistula.
     
     2.  Successful dilation of the stenosed areas with 5 and 6 mm angioplasty
     balloons.
     
     3.  Recommend to attempt future hemodialysis access only in the thrilling vein
     palpable on the medial aspect of the left arm, not in the pulsatile vein on
     the lateral aspect of the distal arm.

     INDICATIONS:  75-year-old man with dropping hematocrit following cardiac
     catheterization.
     
     COMPARISONS:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There are small bilateral pleural
     effusions, larger on the right than left.  There is adjacent compressive
     atelectasis at the right lung base as well.  Multiple linear atelectases are
     seen at the left base but the lung bases are otherwise well aerated.  There is
     a tiny calcified granuloma at the right lung bases as well.  The liver is
     somewhat dense, measuring 80 Hounsfield units on the noncontrast image which
     can be seen for example in amiodarone therapy.  Within the limitations of a
     noncontrast examination, the gallbladder, pancreas, and spleen are within
     normal limits.  The adrenal glands appear normal.
     
     A normal right kidney is not evidence, although there may be a tiny remnant
     related to atrophy. Correlation with surgical history is also suggested to
     ascertain whether right nephrectomy has been performed. There are two large
     cysts with fluid like attenuation in the kidney, on the left, one measuring 33
     mm, the other 44 mm. The larger one has a slightly calcified wall and possibly
     an internal septation.  Two smaller 8 mm cysts are too small to characterize.
     The left kidney is markedly atrophic. There are diffuse vascular
     calcifications.
     
     There is a large hiatal hernia. Otherwise, the stomach, small and large bowel
     are unremarkable within the limitations of a noncontrast study.  There is no
     mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, or free air or fluid.
     
     In the right lower quadrant in the pericolic gutter, there are some surgical
     clips, as well as dense material of 50 Hounsfield units.  This region may
     relate to a prior surgery perhaps surgical clips or calfifications are present
     nearby, but the presence of dense material in the clinical context raises the
     possibility of retroperitoneal hemorrhage status post catheterization.
     However, the appearance is felt more likely chronic, possible due to old
     hematoma. Otherwise, no evidence of hematoma is seen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The prostate, bladder are within normal
                                                                 (Over)

     lymphadenopathy or free fluid.  Contrast passes through to the rectum.
     
     There is a central venous catheter extending into the right common iliac vein.
     There is some stranding in the right groin consistent with recent
     catheterization, but no hematoma.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are heterotopic calcifications in the right groin as

     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Large hiatal hernia.
     2)  Coronary and aortic calcifications.
     3)  Small bilateral pleural effusions and atelectases.
     4)  Atrophic kidneys, with likely cysts on the left. Since only a tiny
     possible small remnant is present on the right, corelation with surgical
     history is suggested.
     5) Question of hematoma in the right lower quadrant, although postoperative
     changes, or old hematoma, are a possibility as well.  The appearance is felt
     more likely chronic. If there is concern for continuing hemorrhage at a later
     time, a follow-up study could be helpful. The case was discussed with a
     resident covering the patient.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  A 75-year-old male with four dialysis, left arteriovenous fistula.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3349**] [**Name (STitle) 3350**] and Dr.
     [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6**], attending radiologist, present and
     supervising.  After explaining risks and benefits of the procedure to the
     patient's wife who is his healthcare proxy, a telephone informed consent was
     obtained.  The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table.  The left
     upper arm was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.  After local
     administration of 1% lidocaine, the fistula was accessed with a 21-gauge
     micropuncture needle.  An 0.018 guide wire was advanced through the needle
     into the fistula, the needle was exchanged for a 4.5-French micropuncture
     sheath with inner dilator.  The inner dilator and guidewire were removed.  A
     test injection was made to confirm appropriate placement of the micropuncture
     sheath.  The sheath was then connected to a power injector, and a venogram
     performed.  This demonstrated good outflow along the tract leading to the
     superior vena cava.  No interval change is seen from the prior study three
     days ago.  No evidence of obvious stenosis is seen.  The arm cuff was then
     inflated and contrast injected through a power injector, which demonstrated
     a patent arterial anastomosis.  Also, seen was flow into an adjacent occluded
     fistula in the region of the elbow, which was also demonstrated on the prior
     exam.  A decision was made to insert a tunneled hemodialysis catheter at the
     request of the primary team, which is dictated separately. The micropuncture
     sheath was removed, and manual pressure applied until adequate hemostasis was
     achieved.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Fistulogram demonstrating good outflow into the right heart, with
     a widely patent arterial graft anastomosis.  Adjacent nonfunctioning fistula
     demonstrated again.

     HISTORY:  75-year-old male with malfunctioning left upper extremity
     arteriovenous fistula, needs long-term hemodialysis.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:
     The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3349**] [**Name (STitle) 3350**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6**] with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 6**], the Attending Radiologist, supervising the entire procedure.  After
     obtaining written informed consent from the patient's health care proxy,
     patient's wife, the patient was placed supine on the angiographic table.  His
     right neck and upper chest were prepped and draped in standard sterile
     fashion.  A preprocedure time out was performed.  The right internal jugular
     vein was accessed using ultrasonographic guidance with a 21-gauge
     micropuncture needle after local administration of 1% lidocaine.  Then a 0.018
     guide wire was advanced through the needle into the superior vena cava using
     fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was exchanged for a micropuncture sheath
     with inner dilator.  Attention was then directed towards creation of the
     tunnel along the designated tract where local 1% lidocaine was administered. A
     skin [**Doctor Last Name 1197**] was made at the designated catheter insertion site.  A 23 cm cuff-
     to-tip hemodialysis catheter was connected to a tunneling device, and advanced
     through the subcutaneous tissues, and taken out adjacent to the venous
     insertion site.  The inner dilator and guide wire of the micropuncture sheath
     were removed.  An 035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under
     fluoroscopic guidance.  The micropuncture sheath was sequentially exchanged
     for 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 French dilators.  Subsequently a 14 French peel-away
     sheath with inner dilator was advanced over the wire along the venous tract.
     With the patient holding breath, the inner dilator was removed, and the
     catheter inserted into the peel-away sheath, which was then removed.  Final
     fluoroscopic chest x-ray demonstrated tip of the catheter to be present in the
     high right atrium.  The catheter was secured to the skin using 0 silk sutures
     and OpSite.  The venous insertion site was covered with Dermabond, dry sterile
     dressing, and Tegaderm. The catheter was flushed, Hep-Locked and capped.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     `
     
     HISTORY:  75-year-old male with malfunctioning left upper extremity
     arteriovenous fistula, needs long-term hemodialysis.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:
     The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3349**] [**Name (STitle) 3350**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6**] with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 6**], the Attending Radiologist, supervising the entire procedure.  After
     obtaining written informed consent from the patient's health care proxy,
     patient's wife, the patient was placed supine on the angiographic table.  His
     right neck and upper chest were prepped and draped in standard sterile
     fashion.  A preprocedure time out was performed.  The right internal jugular
     vein was accessed using ultrasonographic guidance with a 21-gauge
     micropuncture needle after local administration of 1% lidocaine.  Then a 0.018
     guide wire was advanced through the needle into the superior vena cava using
     fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was exchanged for a micropuncture sheath
     with inner dilator.  Attention was then directed towards creation of the
     tunnel along the designated tract where local 1% lidocaine was administered. A
     skin [**Doctor Last Name 1197**] was made at the designated catheter insertion site.  A 23 cm cuff-
     to-tip hemodialysis catheter was connected to a tunneling device, and advanced
     through the subcutaneous tissues, and taken out adjacent to the venous
     insertion site.  The inner dilator and guide wire of the micropuncture sheath
     were removed.  An 035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under
     fluoroscopic guidance.  The micropuncture sheath was sequentially exchanged
     for 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 French dilators.  Subsequently a 14 French peel-away
     sheath with inner dilator was advanced over the wire along the venous tract.
     With the patient holding breath, the inner dilator was removed, and the
     catheter inserted into the peel-away sheath, which was then removed.  Final
     fluoroscopic chest x-ray demonstrated tip of the catheter to be present in the
     high right atrium.  The catheter was secured to the skin using 0 silk sutures
     and OpSite.  The venous insertion site was covered with Dermabond, dry sterile
     dressing, and Tegaderm. The catheter was flushed, Hep-Locked and capped.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     Successful placement of 23 cm tip-to-cuff right internal jugular tunneled
     hemodialysis catheter with tip in the high right atrium, ready for use.
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  A 75-year-old male with four dialysis, left arteriovenous fistula.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3349**] [**Name (STitle) 3350**] and Dr.
     [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6**], attending radiologist, present and
     supervising.  After explaining risks and benefits of the procedure to the
     patient's wife who is his healthcare proxy, a telephone informed consent was
     obtained.  The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table.  The left
     upper arm was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.  After local
     administration of 1% lidocaine, the fistula was accessed with a 21-gauge
     micropuncture needle.  An 0.018 guide wire was advanced through the needle
     into the fistula, the needle was exchanged for a 4.5-French micropuncture
     sheath with inner dilator.  The inner dilator and guidewire were removed.  A
     test injection was made to confirm appropriate placement of the micropuncture
     sheath.  The sheath was then connected to a power injector, and a venogram
     performed.  This demonstrated good outflow along the tract leading to the
     superior vena cava.  No interval change is seen from the prior study three
     days ago.  No evidence of obvious stenosis is seen.  The arm cuff was then
     inflated and contrast injected through a power injector, which demonstrated
     a patent arterial anastomosis.  Also, seen was flow into an adjacent occluded
     fistula in the region of the elbow, which was also demonstrated on the prior
     exam.  A decision was made to insert a tunneled hemodialysis catheter at the
     request of the primary team, which is dictated separately. The micropuncture
     sheath was removed, and manual pressure applied until adequate hemostasis was
     achieved.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Fistulogram demonstrating good outflow into the right heart, with
     a widely patent arterial graft anastomosis.  Adjacent nonfunctioning fistula
     demonstrated again.

     INDICATION:  Coronary artery disease and CHF with low-grade temperature,
     evaluate for pneumonia.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2533-6-25**].
     
     PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  There has been interval resolution of CHF.
     The pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits.  Cardiomegaly is again
     seen.  The mediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  There is blunting
     of the left costophrenic angle, consistent with a small effusion.
     
     There is flattening of the diaphragms, suggestive of emphysematous change.  A
     right-sided central venous catheter is seen with the tip in the mid SVC. There
     is a faint opacity in the right middle lung zone.  While this likely
     represents a confluence of overlying shadows from structures that are outside
     of the thorax, early pneumonia in this area cannot be definitively excluded.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Interval resolution of CHF.  Small left pleural effusion.
     2)  Faint opacity in the right middle lung zone, which likely represents a
     confluence of overlying shadows from structures outside of the thorax.
     However, an early pneumonia in this area cannot be definitely excluded.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis.  Status post recent
     removal of a right internal jugular tunneled dialysis catheter secondary to
     infection.  Now placement of a new tunneled dialysis catheter is requested.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 58**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 59**] and Dr.
     [**First Name (STitle) 79**] [**Name (STitle) 43**] D'Othee.  The attending physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 43**] [**Name (STitle) **] was present
     and supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     CONSENT:  After the risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with
     the patient's daughter, written informed consent was obtained.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The patient was placed supine on the procedure table. The
     left lower neck and upper chest wall were prepped and draped in a standard
     sterile fashion.  The left internal jugular vein was noted to be patent and
     compressible, but small by ultrasound.  The left external jugular vein was
     patent, compressible, and large in caliber.  1% lidocaine was administered to
     the skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the left external jugular vein.
     Under ultrasound guidance, the left external jugular vein was accessed with a
     21-gauge needle.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, a 0.018 guidewire was advanced
     through the needle into the superior vena cava.  The needle was exchanged for
     a 4-French micropuncture sheath.  The guidewire was exchanged for a 0.035
     Bentson guidewire.
     
     Attention was then turned to creating a tunnel.  The selected exit and entry
     sites for the tunneled tract were anesthetized with 1% lidocaine, and
     incisions at those sites were made with a scalpel.  A 14.5 French, double
     lumen, 27 cm cuff-to-tip hemodialysis catheter was advanced through the tunnel
     tract with the help of a tunneler.  The venous access site in the lower neck
     was sequentially dilated with 7, 12, and 14-French dilators. The 14-French
     dilator was then exchanged for a 14.5-French peel-away sheath. The
     hemodialysis catheter was directed into the sheath and advanced through the
     superior vena cava into the right atrium under fluoroscopic guidance.  A final
     fluoroscopic chest radiograph was obtained, documenting catheter tip in the
     right atrium.  The catheter was flushed and capped.  It was secured to the
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis.  Status post recent
     removal of a right internal jugular tunneled dialysis catheter secondary to
     infection.  Now placement of a new tunneled dialysis catheter is requested.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 58**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 59**] and Dr.
     [**First Name (STitle) 79**] [**Name (STitle) 43**] D'Othee.  The attending physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 43**] [**Name (STitle) **] was present
     and supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     CONSENT:  After the risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with
     the patient's daughter, written informed consent was obtained.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The patient was placed supine on the procedure table. The
     left lower neck and upper chest wall were prepped and draped in a standard
     sterile fashion.  The left internal jugular vein was noted to be patent and
     compressible, but small by ultrasound.  The left external jugular vein was
     patent, compressible, and large in caliber.  1% lidocaine was administered to
     the skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the left external jugular vein.
     Under ultrasound guidance, the left external jugular vein was accessed with a
     21-gauge needle.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, a 0.018 guidewire was advanced
     through the needle into the superior vena cava.  The needle was exchanged for
     a 4-French micropuncture sheath.  The guidewire was exchanged for a 0.035
     Bentson guidewire.
     
     Attention was then turned to creating a tunnel.  The selected exit and entry
     sites for the tunneled tract were anesthetized with 1% lidocaine, and
     incisions at those sites were made with a scalpel.  A 14.5 French, double
     lumen, 27 cm cuff-to-tip hemodialysis catheter was advanced through the tunnel
     tract with the help of a tunneler.  The venous access site in the lower neck
     was sequentially dilated with 7, 12, and 14-French dilators. The 14-French
     dilator was then exchanged for a 14.5-French peel-away sheath. The
     hemodialysis catheter was directed into the sheath and advanced through the
     superior vena cava into the right atrium under fluoroscopic guidance.  A final
     fluoroscopic chest radiograph was obtained, documenting catheter tip in the
     right atrium.  The catheter was flushed and capped.  It was secured to the
                                                                 (Over)

     PA AND LATERAL CHEST:  Compared to [**2533-7-2**].  The right-sided subclavian
     catheter has been removed and replaced with a left-sided subclavian catheter
     with its tip just distal to the atriocaval junction.  No pneumothorax is
     identified.  The heart is enlarged but stable.  The mediastinal and hilar
     contours are unchanged.  There is calcification seen within the aortic arch.
     There are small bilateral pleural effusions, not significantly changed
     compared to the prior study.  Background emphysematous changes.  The faint
     opacity seen overlying the right mid lung zone on the prior study is less
     apparent and likely represents overlap of vascular shadow.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Left subclavian catheter with its tip in the proximal right atrium; no
     pneumothorax.
     2) Stable cardiomegaly with persisting small pleural effusions but without
     evidence of congestive heart failure.
     3) No evidence of pneumonia.
     4) Large hiatal hernia.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  75-year-old man with end-stage renal disease, on
     hemodialysis through left arm AV fistula, presents with problem with the
     fistula, now needs fistulogram.
     
     PHYSICIANS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2247**] [**Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 43**] [**Name (STitle) 44**].
     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 43**] [**Name (STitle) 44**], the attending radiologist, was present and supervising
     throughout the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  After the risks and benefit were explained to the
     patient, written informed consent was obtained.  The patient was placed supine
     on the angiographic table.  The left arm was prepped and draped in the
     standard sterile fashion.  A preprocedure timeout was obtained to confirm the
     patient's name, procedure, and the site.  5 cc of 1% lidocaine was applied for
     local anesthesia.  Under ultrasonographic guidance, a 21-gauge needle was used
     to access the left arm AV fistula.  A 0.018 guidewire was placed through the
     needle under fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was exchanged for a
     micropuncture sheath.  Venogram was performed through the sheath, which
     demonstrated narrowed segment at the outflow vein.  There is no evidence of
     central venous stenosis.
     
     Based on the diagnostic findings, the decision was made that the patient would
     benefit from angioplasty.  A Glidewire was then advanced through the sheath
     and the sheath was exchanged for a 5-French vascular sheath.  The narrowed
     segment of the outflow vein was dilated by using 6 x 4 mm first, and then 8 x
     4 balloons in overlapped fashion. Follow-up venogram demonstrated good
     angiographic result.  There is a thrill palpated along the AV fistula
     immediately after the angioplasty.
     
     The sheath was then removed and the hemostasis was achieved by direct manual
     pressure for 10 minutes.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      75 year old man with ESRD and problematic fistula.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Pt. has a L upper arm AV fistula that has been functioning up until today.
      HD able to cannulate AVF without problems but [**Name2 (NI) 5274**] then clot up. Pt.
      reneedled and put on HD machine and the whole dialysis system clots. Sounds
      like there may be an inflow problem or outflow problem. There is still a bruit
      and thrill in the access. Please do fistulagram with angioplasty if indicated.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  75-year-old man with end-stage renal disease, on
     hemodialysis through left arm AV fistula, presents with problem with the
     fistula, now needs fistulogram.
     
     PHYSICIANS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2247**] [**Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 43**] [**Name (STitle) 44**].
     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 43**] [**Name (STitle) 44**], the attending radiologist, was present and supervising
     throughout the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  After the risks and benefit were explained to the
     patient, written informed consent was obtained.  The patient was placed supine
     on the angiographic table.  The left arm was prepped and draped in the
     standard sterile fashion.  A preprocedure timeout was obtained to confirm the
     patient's name, procedure, and the site.  5 cc of 1% lidocaine was applied for
     local anesthesia.  Under ultrasonographic guidance, a 21-gauge needle was used
     to access the left arm AV fistula.  A 0.018 guidewire was placed through the
     needle under fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was exchanged for a
     micropuncture sheath.  Venogram was performed through the sheath, which
     demonstrated narrowed segment at the outflow vein.  There is no evidence of
     central venous stenosis.
     
     Based on the diagnostic findings, the decision was made that the patient would
     benefit from angioplasty.  A Glidewire was then advanced through the sheath
     and the sheath was exchanged for a 5-French vascular sheath.  The narrowed
     segment of the outflow vein was dilated by using 6 x 4 mm first, and then 8 x
     4 balloons in overlapped fashion. Follow-up venogram demonstrated good
     angiographic result.  There is a thrill palpated along the AV fistula
     immediately after the angioplasty.
     
     The sheath was then removed and the hemostasis was achieved by direct manual
     pressure for 10 minutes.
                                                                 (Over)

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      75 year old man with ESRD and problematic fistula.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Pt. has a L upper arm AV fistula that has been functioning up until today.
      HD able to cannulate AVF without problems but [**Name2 (NI) 5274**] then clot up. Pt.
      reneedled and put on HD machine and the whole dialysis system clots. Sounds
      like there may be an inflow problem or outflow problem. There is still a bruit
      and thrill in the access. Please do fistulagram with angioplasty if indicated.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  75-year-old man with end-stage renal disease, on
     hemodialysis through left arm AV fistula, presents with problem with the
     fistula, now needs fistulogram.
     
     PHYSICIANS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2247**] [**Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 43**] [**Name (STitle) 44**].
     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 43**] [**Name (STitle) 44**], the attending radiologist, was present and supervising
     throughout the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  After the risks and benefit were explained to the
     patient, written informed consent was obtained.  The patient was placed supine
     on the angiographic table.  The left arm was prepped and draped in the
     standard sterile fashion.  A preprocedure timeout was obtained to confirm the
     patient's name, procedure, and the site.  5 cc of 1% lidocaine was applied for
     local anesthesia.  Under ultrasonographic guidance, a 21-gauge needle was used
     to access the left arm AV fistula.  A 0.018 guidewire was placed through the
     needle under fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was exchanged for a
     micropuncture sheath.  Venogram was performed through the sheath, which
     demonstrated narrowed segment at the outflow vein.  There is no evidence of
     central venous stenosis.
     
     Based on the diagnostic findings, the decision was made that the patient would
     benefit from angioplasty.  A Glidewire was then advanced through the sheath
     and the sheath was exchanged for a 5-French vascular sheath.  The narrowed
     segment of the outflow vein was dilated by using 6 x 4 mm first, and then 8 x
     4 balloons in overlapped fashion. Follow-up venogram demonstrated good
     angiographic result.  There is a thrill palpated along the AV fistula
     immediately after the angioplasty.
     
     The sheath was then removed and the hemostasis was achieved by direct manual
     pressure for 10 minutes.
                                                                 (Over)

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Pt. had a fistulagram last Friday. HD still cannot cannulate AVF easily d/t
      edema. Flows are not adequate for good HD clearance. Pt. needs a catheter to
      rest arm. Please place tunneled HD cath on R side if possible so pt. can get a

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  76-year-old male with renal failure who needs tunneled dialysis
     catheter.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3134**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1931**], and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6**], the Attending
     Radiologist, who was present during the entire procedure.
     
     FINDINGS/TECHNIQUE:  The patient was appropriately consented and placed supine
     on the angiographic table.  The right neck and chest were prepped and draped
     sterilely.  Preprocedure timeout was performed.  1% lidocaine was administered
     for local anesthesia.  Using the ultrasound guidance the patency of the right
     internal jugular vein was confirmed.  Under ultrasound guidance the 21-gauge
     needle was advanced into the right internal jugular vein and a 0.018 guidewire
     was advanced into the SVC under flouroscopic guidance.  Hard copy ultrasound
     images were obtained before and after venous access documenting vessel
     patency. The needle was exchanged for a 4.5 French micropuncture introducer
     sheath and the 0.018 wire was exchanged for a 0.035 J wire which was placed in
     the IVC. Then a small incision was made over the right chest and a
     subcutaneous tunnel was created using blunt dissection. A 23-cm tip to cuff
     14.5 French double- lumen hemodialysis catheter was pulled through the tunnel.
     The venous tract was dilated with 10, 12, and 14 French dilators.  The
     catheter was advanced into the right atrium via the peel-away introducer
     sheath which was removed. The proximal incision was closed with Dermabond. The
     distal portion of the catheter was secured to the skin with 0 silk. Sterile
     dressing was applied. Fluoroscopic image was obtained confirming correct
     position of the tip of the catheter in the right atrium. Excellent blood flow
     was achieved through both ports.  The catheter was heplocked.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 23-cm tip to cuff 14.5 French double-
     lumen hemodialysis catheter via the right internal jugular vein into the right
     atrium under ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance.  Catheter is ready for use.

     AP and lateral upright chest radiographs were compared to the previous film
     from [**2533-7-8**].
     
     The heart size is enlarged.  A hiatal hernia is again demonstrated with air-
     fluid level within it.  The aorta is tortuous, elongated with dilated aortic
     arch markedly calcified.
     
     The Port-A-Cath is inserted on the left with its tip projecting over the right
     atrium.
     
     A focal pulmonary consolidation is seen as well.  No evidence of congestive
     heart failure is present.  A lateral film demonstrates significant
     calcification within the aorta, unchanged in comparison to the previous study.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Large hiatal hernia.
     
     2.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.

      assess for mass, bleed

     WET READ: KKXa TUE [**2534-4-20**] 5:46 PM
      Exam markedly limited by motion, especially in evaluating small amounts of
      subarachnoid hemorrhage. No definite hemorrhage or shift of midline
      structures.
      
      Also, there are tiny calcs noted at the floor of the left middle cranial
      fossa, which could be from volume averaging of adjacent bone. However, a
      meningioma at this locale cannot be excluded on the basis of this study.
      Calcifications of a remote contusion are less likely.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Altered mental status.  Evaluate for hemorrhage or mass.
     
     No prior exams are available for comparison.
     
     NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN:  This examination is substantially degraded by
     patient motion, and is limited in evaluating such entities as small amounts of
     subarachnoid hemorrhage.  There is no evidence of acute intracranial
     hemorrhage on this study.  The ventricles and sulci are prominent, consistent
     with a moderate atrophy.  There is no shift of the normally midline
     structures.  There is hypodensity of the cerebral periventricular white
     matter, consistent with moderate-to-severe chronic microvascular ischemia.
     
     At the floor of the left middle cranial fossa, there are apparent few coarse
     calcifications, which may represent partial volume averaging of the adjacent
     temporal bone.  However, these may represent dystrophic dural calcification
     or, even, a dural-based process such as a small meningioma. Calcifications
     within a remote temporal lobe contusion are less likely, given the lack of
     encephalomalacia.
     
     The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Examination substantially limited by motion as described.  No definite
     acute intracranial hemorrhage process.
     2.  Evidence of moderately severe chronic microvascular ischemic change.
     3.  Possible calcifications within the inferior left middle cranial fossa as
     described.  These could be artifactual, or represent dural calcifications,
     even related to  meningioma.  Parenchymal calcifications within a remote
     contusion are less likely.
     
     COMMENT: Findings were relayed to the ED dashboard at the time of
     interpretation.

     HISTORY:  76-year-old man with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis with
     staph bacteremia and fever.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 815**] and
     [**Name5 (PTitle) 512**], the attending physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was present and supervising.  Informed
     consent was obtained and preprocedure timeout was performed.  After cutting
     the suture the patient's right IJ tunneled dialysis catheter was removed.  The
     tip was sent for culture.  A small amount purulent appearing fluid was
     expressed from the tunnel tract.  This was also sent for culture.  The
     patient's left neck was then prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.
     After infusion of 1% lidocaine, a vein medial to the carotid artery was
     accessed with a 21-gauge needle under ultrasonographic guidance.  This may
     represent an abnormal position of the internal jugular vein.  Hard copy
     ultrasound images were obtained before and after access.  An 0.018 wire was
     advanced into the SVC under flouroscopic guidance. Measurements were obtained
     and it was determined that a 24-cm length of the catheter would be
     appropriate. The tract was dilated and a 24-cm 14- French temporary dialysis
     catheter was advanced over an 0.035 wire into the right atrium.  The line was
     flushed and heplocked and the line was secured with 0- silk sutures.  The
     patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate post-
     procedure complications.  A final chest image demonstrated appropriate
     positioning of the line tip in the right atrium.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Removal of right IJ tunneled catheter.  The line tip and a small amount of
     purulent material from the tract were sent for culture.
     
     2.  Successful placement of a left-sided 24-cm 14-French temporary dialysis
     catheter via what may be an aberrantly positioned internal jugular vein or
     collateral vein.  The tip is in the right atrium and the line is ready for
     immediate use.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     HISTORY:  76-year-old man with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis with
     staph bacteremia and fever.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 815**] and
     [**Name5 (PTitle) 512**], the attending physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was present and supervising.  Informed
     consent was obtained and preprocedure timeout was performed.  After cutting
     the suture the patient's right IJ tunneled dialysis catheter was removed.  The
     tip was sent for culture.  A small amount purulent appearing fluid was
     expressed from the tunnel tract.  This was also sent for culture.  The
     patient's left neck was then prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.
     After infusion of 1% lidocaine, a vein medial to the carotid artery was
     accessed with a 21-gauge needle under ultrasonographic guidance.  This may
     represent an abnormal position of the internal jugular vein.  Hard copy
     ultrasound images were obtained before and after access.  An 0.018 wire was
     advanced into the SVC under flouroscopic guidance. Measurements were obtained
     and it was determined that a 24-cm length of the catheter would be
     appropriate. The tract was dilated and a 24-cm 14- French temporary dialysis
     catheter was advanced over an 0.035 wire into the right atrium.  The line was
     flushed and heplocked and the line was secured with 0- silk sutures.  The
     patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate post-
     procedure complications.  A final chest image demonstrated appropriate
     positioning of the line tip in the right atrium.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Removal of right IJ tunneled catheter.  The line tip and a small amount of
     purulent material from the tract were sent for culture.
     
     2.  Successful placement of a left-sided 24-cm 14-French temporary dialysis
     catheter via what may be an aberrantly positioned internal jugular vein or
     collateral vein.  The tip is in the right atrium and the line is ready for
     immediate use.

     HISTORY:  76-year-old male status post PICC line placement.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2534-4-20**].
     
     A single frontal chest radiograph was obtained demonstrating interval
     placement of a right-sided PICC line and left- sided dual-lumen dialysis
     catheter both with tips projecting over the right atrium.  Heart size and
     cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Again seen is extensive
     calcification of the aortic knob. There is a large hiatal hernia. The lungs
     are grossly clear and no consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax or
     evidence of congestive heart failure is identified. Surrounding osseous and
     soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Interval placement of right-sided PICC line with tip within the right
     atrium.  It is suggested that the PICC line be pulled back approximately 6 cm.
     2.  Left-sided dual-lumen dialysis catheter in appropriate position in the
     right atrium.
     3. Large hiatal hernia.
     
     This was discussed with the IV nurse, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 5281**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5282**] at the time of dictation on
     [**2534-4-25**].

     PHYSICIANS:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 60**] [**Doctor Last Name 41**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1560**] [**Doctor Last Name 389**] performed the procedure with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 389**], the attending radiologist, being present and supervising during the
     procedure.  
     
     PROCEDURE:  Following written informed consent, the patient was positioned
     supine on the angiography table.  A preprocedure timeout was performed to
     confirm patient, procedure, and site.  Standard sterile prep and drape of the
     left base of the neck and upper chest.  The in situ nontunneled hemodialysis
     catheter was prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia
     with 12 ml of 1% lidocaine subcutaneously.  After a small skin incision and
     using the tunneling device a 14.5-French 23-cm cuff-to-tip dual-lumen
     hemodialysis catheter was placed through the subcutaneous tunnel.  Prior to
     placement the catheter was bathed in orthopedic solution.  A 0.035-inch
     guidewire was advanced through the in situ catheter after the retaining
     sutures were cut.  The in situ catheter was removed and a peel-away sheath was
     placed over the guidewire.  The guidewire was removed and the tunneled
     hemodialysis catheter was placed through the peel-away sheath and positioned
     with its tip at the superior vena cava-right atrial junction under
     flouroscopic guidance. The peel- away sheath was removed.  Both lumens of the
     catheter flushed and aspirated well, were capped, and heplocked.  The catheter
     was sutured in place with two 0- Prolene sutures and a sterile transparent
     dressing was applied.  A final limited chest radiograph confirmed catheter tip
     position at the superior vena cava-right atrial junction.  The radiograph also
     demonstrates a PICC line superimposed on the superior vena cava.
     Calcifications of the aortic arch are present.  Suggest correlation with a
     chest radiograph from [**2534-4-25**] under [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5284**].  No immediate
     complications.  The catheter can be used immediately.

     hemodialysis catheter by way of the left internal jugular vein with tip at the
     superior vena cava-right atrial junction.  The catheter can be used

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
       76 year old man with ESRD on HD in need of tunneled line catheter for HD.      
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      cath placement

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis.
     
     PHYSICIANS:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 60**] [**Doctor Last Name 41**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1560**] [**Doctor Last Name 389**] performed the procedure with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 389**], the attending radiologist, being present and supervising during the
     procedure.  
     
     PROCEDURE:  Following written informed consent, the patient was positioned
     supine on the angiography table.  A preprocedure timeout was performed to
     confirm patient, procedure, and site.  Standard sterile prep and drape of the
     left base of the neck and upper chest.  The in situ nontunneled hemodialysis
     catheter was prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia
     with 12 ml of 1% lidocaine subcutaneously.  After a small skin incision and
     using the tunneling device a 14.5-French 23-cm cuff-to-tip dual-lumen
     hemodialysis catheter was placed through the subcutaneous tunnel.  Prior to
     placement the catheter was bathed in orthopedic solution.  A 0.035-inch
     guidewire was advanced through the in situ catheter after the retaining
     sutures were cut.  The in situ catheter was removed and a peel-away sheath was
     placed over the guidewire.  The guidewire was removed and the tunneled
     hemodialysis catheter was placed through the peel-away sheath and positioned
     with its tip at the superior vena cava-right atrial junction under
     flouroscopic guidance. The peel- away sheath was removed.  Both lumens of the
     catheter flushed and aspirated well, were capped, and heplocked.  The catheter
     was sutured in place with two 0- Prolene sutures and a sterile transparent
     dressing was applied.  A final limited chest radiograph confirmed catheter tip
     position at the superior vena cava-right atrial junction.  The radiograph also
     demonstrates a PICC line superimposed on the superior vena cava.
     Calcifications of the aortic arch are present.  Suggest correlation with a
     chest radiograph from [**2534-4-25**] under [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5284**].  No immediate
     complications.  The catheter can be used immediately.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 14.5-French 23-cm cuff-to-tip tunneled
     hemodialysis catheter by way of the left internal jugular vein with tip at the
     superior vena cava-right atrial junction.  The catheter can be used
     immediately.
