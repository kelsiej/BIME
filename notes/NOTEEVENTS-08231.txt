service for cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Peptic ulcer disease with gastrointestinal bleed on
recent admission.
2.  Diabetes type II
3.  Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarction in [**3203**] with an ejection fraction of 35%.
4.  Chronic renal insufficiency
5.  Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 35%.
6.  Gastritis
7.  Helicobacter pylori
8.  Cellulitis
9.  Hypothyroidism
10. Hypercholesterolemia
11. Hypertension
12. Barrett's esophagus
13. Osteoarthritis
14. Status post cholecystectomy
[**18**]. Asthma
16. Status post bilateral tubal ligation
17. Sepsis
18. Bilateral cataract surgery

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN AND CODEINE

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Insulin 70/30, 70 units in a.m., 30 in the p.m.
2.  Synthroid 0.175 qd
3.  Zocor 20 mg qd
4.  Prilosec 40 mg qd
5.  Lasix 20 mg bid
6.  Aspirin 325 mg qd
7.  Nitroglycerin prn

12. Folate 1 mg qd
13. Iron 325 mg qd
14. Zestril 10 mg qd
15. Colace

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the medical
service and scheduled for a cardiac catheterization.  She
underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**3205-6-13**] which revealed
three vessel disease.  Cardiac surgery was consulted at this
point and decision was made to take her to the Operating
Room.  The patient underwent coronary artery bypass graft x3
on [**3205-6-16**] with left internal mammary artery to LAD, RSVG to
OM to RAPD.  She tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the CSR unit in intubated condition.  She was
on pressors at this point.  She was extubated on
postoperative day 1.  Over the next few days it was noted she
had a marginal urine output and she was started on a dopamine
infusion.  On [**3205-6-20**], she was noted to have a left pleural
effusion and a left chest tube was placed.  A renal consult
was obtained on [**3205-6-21**] for the low urine output and rising
creatinine.  They suspected renal hyperperfusion and ATN due
to relative hypertension.  She was slowly weaned off of the
dopamine.  She went into atrial fibrillation/flutter on
[**3205-6-23**].  Renal recommendations were followed.  She continued
to be in flutter on postoperative day 7 and she was started
on a heparin infusion.  She was hemodynamically stable, but
still continued to have marginal urine output and therefore
needed a Neo-Synephrine infusion to keep her blood pressure
up so she could have a urine output.

Electrophysiology was consulted on [**3205-6-24**] for the atrial
fibrillation.  She was cardioverted per EP on postoperative
day 8 and was in sinus rhythm.  She continued to make slow
progress over the next few days.  Her white count increased,
but no focal symptoms occurred.  Per EP recommendations, she
would need to be anticoagulated for about a month.  She was
then started on Coumadin.  She was slowly weaned off of
pressors over the next three days.  Her urine output was
maintained off pressors and diuretics.  Her potassium was
still elevated.  She was transferred to the floor on
postoperative day 13 in stable condition.  She had some wound
drainage at this point and required Betadine dressing
changes.  On postoperative day 14 while on the floor, she
complained of some gassy abdominal pain which was
intermittent.  Subsequently, she had guaiac positive black
melanotic stools.  A lab check at this point revealed a
hematocrit of 23 which was a 7 point drop of prior hematocrit
of 30.  She was started on blood transfusion and her heparin
and Coumadin were discontinued.  A gastrointestinal consult
was obtained at this point and she was transferred back to
the Intensive Care Unit for closer monitoring.  She was
started on Protonix bid and transfused packed red cells.

She underwent an endoscopy by gastrointestinal on [**3205-7-1**].
This revealed a normal esophagogastroduodenectomy to the
second part of the duodenum.  These findings do not explain
melena and hematocrit drop.  If the hematocrit continues to
drop and the patient was stable, the gastrointestinal
consultant advised a colonoscopy.  Her hematocrit stayed
stable after this point and she was considered stable for
transfer back to the regular floor on [**3205-7-2**].  She had high
potassium at this point which was treated.  She has continued
subsequently to be stable and is now ready for discharge to a
rehabilitation facility as soon as a bed is available.

     and supervised the entire case.
     
     TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  The risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to
     the patient and informed consent was obtained.  The left upper extremity was
     prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Ultrasound guidance was used to gain
     access to the left brachial vein.  A dual-lumen PICC was placed via the

     under fluoroscopic guidance.  The catheter was secured to the skin and sterile
     dressing was applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without post-
     procedure complications.  A post-procedure radiograph was performed.
     
     FINDINGS:  The tip of PICC is within the SVC.  There has been median
     sternotomy.  The heart is enlarged.  Air-space disease is present in the right

     CLINICAL INDICATION: 72 year old woman with acute onset of right upper
     quadrant and flank pain.  Evaluate for perforated peptic ulcer, AAA,
     dissection, renal stone, retained bile duct stone.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Helically aquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung bases through the pubic symphysis without the administration of IV
     contrast.  No IV contrast was administered as the patient is in chronic renal
     failure.
     
     COMPARISON: None.
     
     CT ABDOMEN W/O IV CONTRAST: There is a left pleural effusion with a density at
     the left lung base which probably reflects partial collapse/consolidation of
     the left lower lobe. The patient is status post CABG.  No pericardial effusion
     is identified. The noncontrast enhanced liver is within normal limits with no
     evidence of intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.  The patient is status
     post cholecystectomy.  The common duct is mildly prominent, measuring up to 12
     mm in diameter, a measurement which is still within the range of normal status
     post cholecystectomy.  The adrenal glands are unremarkable.  The pancreas is
     atrophic.  The spleen is within normal limits and note is made of dense
     calcifications of the splenic artery. The kidneys are symemtric in size.  No
     renal stones are identified.  The duodenum is collapsed but does not appear
     abnormally thickened.  The aorta is normal in caliber and tapers appropriately
     towards the bifurcation.  The visualized loops of large and small bowel in the
     abdomen are unremarkable. There is no free air or free fluid within the
     abdomen.
     
     CT PELVIS W/O IV CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon, urinary bladder, uterus
     and adnexal regions are within normal limits.  No free fluid is present in the
     deep pelvis.
     
     There are degenerative changes of the osseous structures but no acute
     fractures or destructive bone lesions are seen.

  Overall, pt had a stable day with weaning of dobutamine, and the start of hydralazine and natrecor.  Plan is to ramp up hydralazine as the dobutamine is weaned while following cardiac output and SVR.  Of note:  swan is leaking clear (?IVF) fluid into swan sheath, unable to identify source of fluid.  Plan is to replace swan with heparin free catheter in setting of leakage and decreased plt count.  HIT antibody sent today.  

  Neuro:  Pt alert and oriented X 3, able to move all extremities strongly but strength is limited by arthritis and pts size.  She was medicated with tylenol X 2 for arthritis pain with good relief.

Oozing from line sites has stopped with pressure dressing/gel foam in place.  However, her nose has continued to bleed off and on (small amts).
