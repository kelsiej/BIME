Admission Date: [**3443-8-11**]        Discharge Date: [**3443-8-18**]

Date of Birth:  [**3348-4-17**]        Sex:  F

Service:  NSU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
right-handed woman who was previously healthy and in [**3443-7-4**] started developing difficulty with word finding and
writing letters.  Now has had worsening symptoms times one
week and also some question of slight right-sided weakness.
The patient has had a right ear lesion removed with unknown
pathology.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was awake and alert with
aphasia.  Good comprehension.  Following multi-step commands.
Word finding difficulty.  No left or right confusion.
Extraocular movements intact.  Cranial nerves II through XII
were intact.  Her motor strength was 4 plus in the deltoids
bilaterally, [**6-7**] in biceps, triceps and grasp.  IP was 4 on
the right and 5 on the left.  Quads 4 plus on the right and 5
on the left.  Otherwise, all other muscle groups were [**6-7**]
bilaterally.  Her sensation was intact to light touch.

RADIOLOGY:  Her head CT showed a left parietal 3 cm lesion
with hemorrhage and edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted to the Neurosurgery
Service.  She was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for
close neurologic observation.  She had an MRI scan which
confirmed the presence of this left parietal lesion.  She was
seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] who recommended possible
radiation treatment.  MRI scan showed this lesion that looked
most like a primary brain tumor.  The patient was also seen
by the Radiation Oncology Service who recommended a possible
biopsy followed by radiation.  The family, in discussion with
the patient, had decided that she did not want any treatment.
The patient was therefore seen by Physical Therapy and
Occupational Therapy and found to require a short
rehabilitation stay prior to discharge to home.  Her
neurologic status remained stable.  She was started on some
Decadron with improvement of her word finding difficulties.
Her vital signs remained stable throughout her hospital stay.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Include famotidine 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
heparin 5000 units subcu q. 12h., Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
verapamil 80 p.o. q. 8h., Dilantin 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.,
Decadron currently 6 mg IV q. 4h., Valsartan 80 p.o. q. day,
pilocarpine one drop O.D. q. 8h., lisinopril 20 p.o. q. day.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable at the time of discharge.

FOLLOW UP:  No follow up from Neurosurgery is required unless
requested by the patient.  At this time condition is stable.

      please assess for mass

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  [**Age over 90 **] year old with left hemispheric mass identified on CT performed
     earlier the same day.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2W brain imaging including diffusion weighted
     imaging and post Gadolinium imaging in multiple planes was performed.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is an approximately 3 cm irregularly marginated
     heterogeneously enhancing mass in the left frontoparietal region.  The mass is
     in the deep centrum semiovale and abuts the body and atrium of the left
     lateral ventricle.  There is associated vasogenic edema and slight compressive
     effect on the adjacent left lateral ventricle.  There is no shift of normally
     midline structures and there is no hydrocephalus.  There is also a faint area
     of enhancement in the white matter overlying the right lateral ventricle in
     the frontal lobe.  There are no extra-axial collections.  The osseous
     structures and soft tissues are unremarkable.  The major vascular flow
     patterns are normal.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Enhancing mass in the left frontoparietal white matter with
     associated vasogenic edema is consistent with a neoplasm.  The differential
     includes primary neoplasm of the brain such as a glioblastoma multiforme vs. a
     metastasis.  The area of faint enhancement overlying the right lateral
     ventricle suggests the possibility of multifocal neoplastic process.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Intracranial mass surrounded with hemorrhage change and
     hemorrhage is questioned.
     
     Axial non-contrast CT scans of the brain were obtained.
     
     No previous studies are available for comparison.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     There is hypodensity and swelling of the left frontal and parietal white
     matter, with abnormality extending into the internal and external capsules and
     superior left temporal lobe white matter.  An ill-defined mass with
     attenuation like that of grey matter is identified in the left centrum
     semiovale.  There is a small area of associated hemorrhage.  The left lateral
     ventricle is flattened.  There is no evidence of midline shift.  The basal
     cisternal spaces are wide.  Within the right hemisphere there are patchy areas
     of decreased attenuation, consistent with microvascular ischemia and
     infarction.
     
     The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoids are clear.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     There is a left hemispheric mass with a small amount of hemorrhage.  This may
     represent a primary neoplasm or metastasis.  Clinical correlation is
     recommended.
