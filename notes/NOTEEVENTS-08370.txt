Admission Date:  [**3106-8-2**]       Discharge Date:  [**3106-9-5**]

Date of Birth:   [**3035-12-18**]       Sex:  F

Service:

The patient is being discharged from the Trauma Surgery
Service at [**Hospital1 75**].

ADDENDUM:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4730**] [**Known patient lastname 10845**] remained in the hospital further since
his discharge dictation awaiting rehabilitation bed.  During
that time her progress has been satisfactory and is described
briefly as below.

Neurologically [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4730**] [**Known patient lastname 10845**] continues to be alert and oriented
and although she was trached is able to communicate well.
She is requiring minimal pain medication and should be able
to move to Tylenol from Roxicet fairly soon.  She continues
to be on Zoloft which currently is at 100 mg per nasogastric
tube q day.

Cardiovascular.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4730**] [**Known patient lastname 10845**] has remained stable from a
cardiovascular perspective and has been put on Lopressor for
rate control and cardiac protection.  Her current Lopressor
dose is 25 mg per nasogastric b.i.d.

Respiratory.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4730**] [**Known patient lastname 10845**] continues to make progress on her
vent as she is diuresed.  Her current settings are minimal at
CPAP and pressure support of five.  She should tolerate vent
wean at rehabilitation.  She has finished her course of Zosyn
for pneumonia and has been afebrile off antibiotics.

Gastrointestinal.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4730**] [**Known patient lastname 10845**] has been on tube feeds at goal
for several days.  Her tube feeds have been changed to Nepro
at 45 per hour goal to minimize volume intake.  She is also
on Prevacid prophylaxis.  She is to remain on aspiration
precautions.

Infectious Disease.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4730**] [**Known patient lastname 10845**] has been afebrile off
antibiotics for several days.

Renal.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4730**] [**Known patient lastname 10845**] had a brief episode of ATN which is now
resolving and she has improving creatinine which is currently
at 1.4.  She is being diuresed with Lasix to help her
ventilatory wean.  She will also get one day of Diamox to
help her diuresis and help her high bicarbonate level.

Prophylaxis.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4730**] [**Known patient lastname 10845**] gets Prevacid for prophylaxis and
also gets Lovenox for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis given
her obesity and post trauma status.

Wound care.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4730**] [**Known patient lastname 10845**] has well healing granulating two
small open wounds in her midline abdominal incision.  These
are to be changed with wet-to-dry dressings three times a
day.

Endocrine.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4730**] [**Known patient lastname 10845**] has history of diabetes for which she
has been controlled with insulin standing dose and sliding
scale at the hospital.  Please adjust the sliding scale as
needed to control sugars and check fingersticks four times a
day.

FOLLOW-UP:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4730**] [**Known patient lastname 10845**] should follow-up with the Trauma
Clinic at [**Hospital1 75**] within two
weeks of discharge.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Note, some of these medications
are changed from her prior dictation.

1.  Tube feeds, Nepro at 45 per hour which is goal.
2.  Lovenox 30 mg subcutaneously twice a day.
3.  Zoloft 100 mg per nasogastric once a day.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Trauma, respiratory failure.
     
     TRAUMA SERIES; CHEST:  The heart size is normal.  There is apparent widening
     of the mediastinum.  The endotracheal tube is within 2 cm of the carina.  The
     lungs are clear without focal opacities, effusions or pneumothorax.
     
     AP PELVIS:  This study is extremely limited due to poor exposure.  The
     superior iliac crests have been excluded from the study.  There are slight
     bilateral cortical irregularities along the inferior pubic rami and asymmetry
     within the superior aspect of the symphysis pubis.  No definite gross
     fractures are identified.  The SI joints are suboptimally visualized.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) There is apparent widening of the superior mediastinum.  However, the
     shallow inspiration and supine lordotic view result in inaccurate evaluation
     of the mediastinum.  A vascular injury is difficult to entirely exclude and
     correlation with mechanism of injury and symptoms is recommended.
     2) Extremely limited evaluation of the pelvis.  The apparent cortical
     irregularities along the symphysis pubis and inferior pubic rami should be re-
     evaluated by repeat radiograph.
     3) The endotracheal tube is within 2 cm of the carina and should be withdrawn
     by 1-2 cm.

     PORTABLE AP CHEST dated [**3106-8-3**] is submitted for evaluation. There are no prior
     images for comparison.
     
     FINDINGS: This is a technically limited study as the complete right hemithorax
     is not included. The ETT terminates 1 cm above the carina. The NG tube is in
     the stomach. The Swan-Ganz catheter tip terminates within the right ventricle.
     Adequate assessment of the cardiac and mediastinal contours is limited
     secondary to patient positioning and technical factors. There are decreased
     lung volumes. There are increased interstitial markings consistent with
     congestive heart failure.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) Swan-Ganz catheter suboptimally placed within the right
     ventricle. 2) Evidence of congestive heart failure in this limited study.

     FINDINGS:  7 views of the thoracic and lumbar spine.  Limited study due to
     patient habitus.  There is a widened mediastinum which could be a hematoma,
     further evaluation with cross sectional imaging would be useful.  There
     appears to be slight narrowing of the 7th vertebral body height, correlate
     clinically, as the present evaluation is suboptimal.  The endotracheal tube is
     approximately 1.5 cm from the level of the carina.  There is an NG tube whose
     tip terminates below the level of the film.  There is a Swan-Ganz catheter via
     the IVC with its tip in the right ventricle.  There are surgical staples in
     the abdomen and pelvis.  There are anterior osteophytes in the lumbar spine.
     Normal alignment of the lumbar spine with minimal degenerative disk disease at
     L5-S1.  No fractures of the pelvis visualized.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Very limited, poor quality films secondary to patient habitus.
     Widened mediastinum, further evaluation with cross sectional imaging. Probable
     narrowing of 7th vertebral body height.

     INDICATION:  Check position of right subclavian line.
     
     Reference exam:  [**8-3**].
     
     The endotracheal tube is 3 cm above the carina.  There is a right subclavian
     Swan-Ganz catheter with tip in the right descending pulmonary artery.  There
     is subsegmental atelectasis at both lower lobes.  An underlying infiltrate in
     the left lower lobe can't be totally excluded.  There is increased hazy
     opacity overlying the right lung that likely represents a layering effusion.
     Blunting of the left CP angle likely represents volume loss or small effusion
     there as well.  The heart size is unchanged.  NG tube tip is off the film, at
     least in the stomach.

     CT OF THE THORACIC SPINE [**3106-8-5**].
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  70 year old woman status post trauma with limited plain
     film evaluation.  Question of T7 vertebral body height loss.  Please evaluate
     for fracture.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from T4
     through L1 without the administration of IV contrast.  In addition, sagittal
     and coronal reconstructions were performed.
     
     FINDINGS:  There are multilevel degenerative changes with diffuse disc height
     narrowing and osteophyte formation.  Vertebral bodies T7 and T10 are minimally
     decreased in height in comparison with the other vertebral bodies but no acute
     fractures are identified.  The thoracic spine is well aligned and is without
     evidence of subluxation.  There is calcification within the disc space of
     T8/9.  The central canal is widely patent without evidence of bony
     encroachment and the neural foramina appear grossly free from bony
     encroachment as well.  There are calcifications within the abdominal aorta.
     There are bilateral pleural effusions along with bilateral lower lobe
     atelectasis.  An NG tube passes through the esophagus and out of the view of
     this study.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Multilevel degenerative changes with minimal loss of height of T7
     and T10 vertebral bodies.  No acute fractures identified.  MR is a more
     sensitive examination for detection of edema within the osseous structures,
     though this patient's body habitus would likely prohibit an MR examination.

     HISTORY:  Status post left central venous line placement.  Assess for
     pneumothorax.
     
     PORTABLE AP CHEST:  Comparison is made to previous exam of three hours
     earlier.  The patient is markedly rotated, limiting assessment of the heart
     and lungs.  There has been interval placement of a left-sided central venous
     catheter, with the tip not definitively seen on this exam.  A right-sided
     central venous catheter likely remains in satisfactory position.  The
     endotracheal and nasogastric tubes are in satisfactory position.  There are
     persistent bibasilar hazy opacities, left side greater than right.  The left
     costophrenic angle is not included on this exam, limiting assessment for a
     left-sided pneumothorax on this supine view.  The soft tissues and osseous
     structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Tip of newly inserted left-sided central venous catheter not definitively
     seen on this limited view.  Assessment for a left-sided pneumothorax is also
     limited as the left lateral costophrenic angle is not included on this supine
     view.  A repeat chest radiograph is recommended.
     2.  Allowing for differences in technique, no significant change in the
     previously described bibasilar opacities.

     PORTABLE CHEST:
     
     Compared to 1 day earlier.
     
     INDICATION: Pneumonia. S/P motor vehicle accident.
     
     An ETT and NG tube remain in satisfactory position. There is widening of the
     mediastinum with increased soft tissue density noted lateral to the aortic
     knob calcifications. Review of report of CT torso dated [**3106-8-3**] described no
     evidence of aortic injury, and the observed appearance of the mediastinum
     remains stable compared to the earlier portable radiographs dating back to
     [**3106-8-3**]. The pulmonary vascularity is likely accentuated by low lung volumes
     and portable supine technique. There has been interval improvement in
     previously described basilar lung opacities with residual opacity more
     prominent at the left base on the right. There is a persistent small left
     pleural effusion.
     
     Also noted is a left subclavian vascular catheter terminating in the left
     brachiocephalic vein.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) Stable widening of mediastinum. This is without change since
     recent studies and correlation with report of CT torso of [**3106-8-3**] describes no
     mediastinal hematoma. This is likely due to extensive mediastinal fat as shown
     on the recent CT torso.
     
     2) Improving basilar opacities which may reflect improving atelectasis,
     contusion or aspiration. Underlying infectious process in the left lower lobe
     is not fully excluded.
     
     3) Small left pleural effusion. Right pleural effusion cannot be assessed due
     to exclusion of costophrenic focus from the study.

     and left subclavian catheter remain unchanged.  An NG tube present can be seen
     in the proximal half of the esophagus, but cannot be identified distally.  A
     linear density similar to opacity of a feeding tube overlies the left mainstem
     bronchus.  This may, however, be artifactual and a followup chest x-ray should
     be obtained.

Trach is a #8 Portex, with inner cannula #7. Suctioned for thick tan secretions this am, but subsequently secretions were thin and white. 
Covering MD in and requests that patient be upright as high as possible secondary to [**Doctor Last Name 5**] apnea. Current bed can be converted to a chair but this is less than ideal for this patient, who has a tendency to slide down the bed even with mattress deflated. Ssubsequently the Bari-Care company was called and they will follow up tomorrow with discussions about the Bari-Air bed, which patients are less likely to slide on. A brief trial on trach mask was initiated by covering MD, while patient was in a sitting position. She tolerated this very well. 
The plan is to keep her upright as much as possible once the correct bed comes in, as it is felt she will wean much more quickly in this manner. Patient can also [**Doctor Last Name 5**] in a more upright position, as this will facilitate her breathing. 

GI/GU: Remains on Impact with Fiber at 75cc/hr, which is at goal. 
Abdomen is obese; positive bowel sounds. Rectal bag is in place, draining liquid brown stool. Urine output is improved since yesterday, at 60-70cc/hr. 

Skin: Bed bath given this am. Skin folds are mostly clear, although below left breast is slightly red. Miconazole powder applied to all skin folds. Abdominal incision with intact steri strips. Some erythema around steris. Some old eccymoses left chest and flank, and right knee has healing scab. Patient turned and repositioned throughout the day. 

Endocrine: Insulin per sliding scale. See flow sheet for blood sugars. 

Plan: As stated above: Keep patient upright when correct bed comes in.
Continue with weaning, pulmonary toilet. Monitor labs and blood sugars. Continue with PT/OT with goal of getting patient out of bed.

     PORTABLE CHEST: Comparison is made to previous films from  three days earlier.
     
     A tracheostomy tube and feeding tube remain in place. The tip of the feeding
     tube remains directed cephalad in the fundus of the stomach. There is stable
     widening of the cardiac and mediastinal contours.  The pulmonary vascularity
     appears engorged and slightly indistinct. There is a worsening area of
     increased opacity in the left retrocardiac region. There is new haziness and
     partial obscuration of the right costophrenic sulcus.  The left costophrenic
     sulcus could be assessed if it is excluded from the radiograph.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Worsening left retrocardiac opacity, which may be due to atelectasis or
     pneumonia.

     INDICATION:  Patient is a 70 year old female with pneumonia and needs a PICC
     line for antibiotic therapy.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 89**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 90**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 511**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 512**] with
     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 512**], attending radiologist, being present and supervising the entire
     procedure. The right upper arm was prepped in sterile fashion.  Since no
     suitable superficial veins were visible, ultrasound was used for localization
     of a suitable vein. The right basilic vein was patent and compressible.  After
     local anesthesia with 2 ml 1% lidocaine, the basilic vein was entered under
     ultrasonographic guidance with a 21-gauge needle.  A 0.018 guide wire was
     advanced under fluoroscopy into the superior vena cava.  Based on the markers
     on the guide wire, it was determined that a length of 45 cm would be suitable.
     The PICC line was trimmed to the length and advanced through a 4-French
     introducer sheath under fluoroscopic guidance into the superior vena cava.
     The sheath was removed. The catheter was flushed.  A final chest x-ray was
     obtained.  The film demonstrated the catheter tip to be in the superior vena
     cava just above the atrium. The line is ready for use.
     
     A Stat-Lock was applied and the line was heplocked.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 45-cm total length 4-French single-
     lumen Vaxcel PICC line with tip in the superior vena cava, ready for use.

     CLINICAL INDICATION: 70-year-old woman with acute onset tachycardia and
     diaphoresis.  Prolonged immobilization.  Evaluate for PE.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung bases through the lung apices following the administration of 150 cc of
     Optiray contrast IV per the CTA protocol.  In addition, multiplanar
     reconstructions were performed.
     
     COMPARISONS: There are no prior chest CTs for comparison.
     
     CHEST CT WITH IV CONTRAST: This examination is limited by respiratory motion
     in the patient's very large body habitus, causing streak artifact. However, no
     large pulmonary emboli are identified.  There is a trace amount of fluid in
     the anterior mediastinum.  There are heavy calcifications of the mitral valve
     and coronary arteries.  There is a central line in place with tip at the
     cavoatrial junction.  The aorta is normal in caliber with a few mural
     calcifications.  There is a small left pleural effusion and a trace right
     pleural effusion.  There is consolidation of the left lower lobe posteriorly
     adjacent to the pleural fluid.  The patient has a tracheostomy tube and the
     endotracheal portion terminates several cm above the carina.  There is
     excessive collapse of both the trachea and the right and left mainstem
     bronchi, consistent with tracheobronchomalacia.  No pulmonary nodules are
     identified and there is no pneumothorax.  There is scarring at the lung
     apices.  No enlarged lymphadenopathy is seen.  The osseous structures
     demonstrate rather marked degenerative changes in the lower thoracic spine.
     However, no destructive bone lesions are seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Allowing for the limitations of the examination, no CT evidence of central
     pulmonary embolism.
     
     2. Tracheobronchomalacia in this patient with tracheostomy tube.
     
     3. Small left and trace right pleural effusions with small area of collapse
     and consolidation of the left lower lobe.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     INDICATION: Acute onset tachycardia and diaphoresis after prolonged
     immobilization following MVA, suspicion for pulmonary embolism, limited CT
     angiography.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 3657**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 512**], the Attending Radiologist, who was
     present and supervised the procedure.
     
     CONTRAST & MEDICATION: 1 mg IV Versed, 25 mcg Fentanyl administered in divided
     doses under constant hemodynamic monitoring. 150 cc 60% nonionic contrast
     administered due to patient generalized debilitation.
     
     PROECURE/TECHNIQUE: The patient was informed of details and associated risks
     of procedure and written consent was obtained. The patient was placed supine
     on the angiographic table and right groin was sterile-prepped and draped in
     the usual fashion. 3 cc 1% subcutaneous Lidocaine was administered to soft
     tissues of the right groin. Under fluoroscopic guidance a 19 gauge single wall
     puncture needle was used to gain access to the right common femoral vein.
     Under fluoroscopic guidance a 0.035 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2580**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] wire was advanced into the
     inferior vena cava. The needle was removed and a 5 Fr dilator advanced
     followed by a 7 Fr sheath. A 7 Fr [**Last Name (un) 4349**] pigtail catheter was then advanced
     over a reflecting wire through the inferior vena cava right atrium and
     manipulated such that the tip of the catheter was within the right main
     pulmonary artery. AP and oblique right pulmonary arteriogram is obtained. The
     catheter tip was then repositioned over a 0.035 wire such that the tip is
     within the left main pulmonary artery and AP and oblique left pulmonary
     arteriograms are obtained. The catheter is removed and the 7 Fr sheath left
     within the right common femoral vein at Intensive Card Unit house officer
     request. There were no immediate complications.
     
     FINDINGS: Right and left selective pulmonary arteriograms do not demonstrate
     filling defects. There is no evidence of pulmonary emboli.
     
     IMPRESSION: Bilateral pulmonary arteries without evidence of pulmonary emboli.
     house staff were informed of these findings at the time of the study.

     present and supervised the procedure.
     
     CONTRAST & MEDICATION: 1 mg IV Versed, 25 mcg Fentanyl administered in divided
     doses under constant hemodynamic monitoring. 150 cc 60% nonionic contrast
     administered due to patient generalized debilitation.
     
     PROECURE/TECHNIQUE: The patient was informed of details and associated risks
     of procedure and written consent was obtained. The patient was placed supine
     on the angiographic table and right groin was sterile-prepped and draped in
     the usual fashion. 3 cc 1% subcutaneous Lidocaine was administered to soft
     tissues of the right groin. Under fluoroscopic guidance a 19 gauge single wall
     puncture needle was used to gain access to the right common femoral vein.
     Under fluoroscopic guidance a 0.035 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2580**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] wire was advanced into the
     inferior vena cava. The needle was removed and a 5 Fr dilator advanced
     followed by a 7 Fr sheath. A 7 Fr [**Last Name (un) 4349**] pigtail catheter was then advanced
     over a reflecting wire through the inferior vena cava right atrium and
     manipulated such that the tip of the catheter was within the right main
     pulmonary artery. AP and oblique right pulmonary arteriogram is obtained. The
     catheter tip was then repositioned over a 0.035 wire such that the tip is
     within the left main pulmonary artery and AP and oblique left pulmonary
     arteriograms are obtained. The catheter is removed and the 7 Fr sheath left
     within the right common femoral vein at Intensive Card Unit house officer
     request. There were no immediate complications.
     
     FINDINGS: Right and left selective pulmonary arteriograms do not demonstrate
     filling defects. There is no evidence of pulmonary emboli.
     
     IMPRESSION: Bilateral pulmonary arteries without evidence of pulmonary emboli.
     house staff were informed of these findings at the time of the study.

Respiratory Care
As per above nursing note; pt. had approx. an hour or more of resp distress and required ambuing during most of it. She was breathing entirely out of synch with the ventilator anad unable to generate any tidal volume with  resp effort.   Lavaged and suctioned,, given large amounts of abluterol during this time with no effect. Pt.settled down more comfortably when she was adequately sedated.  Later taken by amubu twice to CT scan (unable to do first scan as pt. did not have  line access.)Currently on simv 500 x 12 40% 10 of peep with few spontaneous breaths. She appears adequaately sedated, comfortable.

     Now with fevers elevated white count and left pleural effusion.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:
     
     COMPARISONS:  None
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous serial axial images were obtained from the lung bases
     to the pubic symphysis after the administration of 150 cc of non-ionic Optiray
     contrast.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  There is a moderate left pleural effusion
     with left basilar atelectiasis.  There is right basilar dependent atelectasis.
     
     Evaluation is limited by body habitus.  Allowing for this, the liver
     gallbladder, pancreas, and adrenals are grossly unremarkable.  A small amount
     of fluid is seen along the inferior aspect of the liver and the gallbladder.
     The patient is S/P splenectomy and an area of high attenuation fluid is seen
     in the splenectomy bed (measuring 70 Houndsfield units) and is consistent with
     a hematoma.  Lower attenuation fluid surrounds this high density region and
     tracts inferiorly (Houndsfield units are 27). There is extensive soft tissue
     swelling and edema within the left greater than right lateral chest walls.
     Evaluation of the left lateral chest wall is limited by artifact (related to
     body habitus/positioning).  Multiple left- sided rib fractures are present.
     Small low attenuation foci are seen within both kidneys likely representing
     cysts but too small to accurately characterize.  The kidneys are otherwise
     grossly unremarkable and demonstrate normal excretion of contrast.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  A Foley catheter is present within the
     bladder.  The rectum and intrapelvic loops of bowel are grossly unremarkable.
     There is no free pelvic fluid, nor inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.
     Stranding is seen within the subcutaneous soft tissue, most prominent along
     the inferior margin of the patient's pannus and likely relates to volume
     overload.

     INDICATIONS:  70 y/o woman s/p MVA and tracheostomy tube placement. 
     
     PORTABLE AP CHEST: A single, AP portable radiograph of the chest was obtained
     and compared to the next prior study dated [**3106-8-28**].  A tracheostomy tube is
     present with tip located approximately 5 cm above the carina. There is a right
     sided PICC with tip in the lower SVC. The overall heart size is enlarged but
     stable. Again seen is mild left heart failure. Allowing for technical
     differences, there appears to have been an interval increase in a left sided
     pleural effusion.  Patchy bilbasilar atelectasis persists.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Appropriate positioning of tracheostomy tube as described above.
     Mild left heart failure with interval increase in left pleural effusion.
