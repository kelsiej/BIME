Brief Hospital Course:
#Lower GI bleeding, NOS; likely secondary to manual 
disimpaction: seen by GI and OB/GYN teams who felt bleeding was 
clearly GI.  GI team consulted and felt etiology of bleed was 
likely hemmrhoidal vs diverticulae vs trauma from self 
disimpaction. GI team felt given advanced age and stable HCT 
(after transfusion of 1U of PRBC), that flex sigmoidoscopy would 
not be indicated given the patients advanced age.  Morever, the 
patient was completely asx.  The patient should be given senna, 
colace daily and would benefit from enemas.  She should not be 
allowed to mannually self disimpact herself.  Of note, ASA 
decreased to 81 mg on d/c.
.
#2 cm Vaginal abrasion: noted on GYN exam.  Felt to be secondary 
to trauma from ED speculum exam.  SW consulted; did not find any 
evidence to support sexual abuse.
.
#Afib:  kept on BB.  Of note, ASA decreased as above.
 
Medications on Admission:
Same (except full dose ASA)

     PA AND LATERAL CHEST [**2989-1-7**] AT 12:39 P.M.
     
     HISTORY:  Rectal and vaginal bleeding.
     
     COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated [**2988-2-10**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The patient is again markedly rotated limiting the examination. 
     There has been mild improvement in the vascular indistinctness previously
     noted with mild residual remaining.  No focal consolidation is evident.  A
     large tortuous atherosclerotic aorta is again seen.  The cardiac silhouette is
     enlarged but stable.  A prominent hiatal hernia is again seen in the
     retrocardiac region.  The bones are remarkably osteopenic.  Stable chronic
     superior endplate compression fracture is noted at the thoracolumbar junction.
     There is exaggerated kyphosis throughout the upper and mid thoracic spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Improvement in volume status relative to the most recent prior
     study with mild residual edema persisting.  No focal consolidation seen. 
     Otherwise stable.
