Admission Date:  [**3248-3-23**]       Death Date:  [**3248-4-16**]

Date of Birth:   [**3248-3-23**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Neonatology
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby Girl [**Known patient lastname 12349**] expired this
morning on day of life 24 from overwhelming sepsis.  She was
born at 25 and 1/7th weeks gestation to a 29-year-old gravida
2, para 0 now 1 woman.  The mother's prenatal screens were
blood type O+, antibody negative, Rubella immune, RPR
positive, CMV IGM negative, GBS unknown.  This pregnancy was
complicated by an abnormal maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein
with an elevated risk of trisomy 21.  A level II ultrasound
showed echogenic bowel, but was otherwise within normal
limits.  The parents declined an amniocentesis.  The mother
presented in preterm labor refractory to magnesium sulfate
tocolysis.  One dose of betamethasone was administered 18
premature rupture of membranes.  Preterm labor continued
until delivery by cesarean section under epidural anesthesia
for breech presentation.  The infant emerged with some tone,
but weak respiratory effort.  She was extubated in the
delivery room.  Her birth weight was 725 gm.  Her birth
length was 31 cm and her birth head circumference was 23 cm,
all in the 25th to 50th percentile.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM revealed an extremely premature
infant, non dysmorphic, intact palate.  Normal neck, normal
oral palate intact.  Moderate subcostal retractions.  Pink
and well perfused.  Nondistended abdomen, three vessel
umbilical cord, premature external female genitalia and
moving all limbs symmetrically, responsive to stimulation, 1
cm slightly raised erythematous lesion on the left anterior
thigh noted at delivery consistent with an abrasion.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1.  RESPIRATORY STATUS:  She was intubated in the delivery
room and she remained so during her entire hospital stay.
During the day befor eher death she required increasing
respiratory support for persistent metabolic and
respiratory acidosis.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR STATUS:  She required pressor support soon
after admission until day of life 8.  She was also treated
with stress doses of hydrocortisone and she was treated on
day of life 1 with indomethacin for a presumed patent ductus
arteriosus.  A repeat cardiac echocardiogram on day of life 4
showed a small patent ductus arteriosus and she was again
treated with another course of indomethacin.  Her last
echocardiogram on [**4-9**] again showed a moderate sized patent
ductus arteriosus which was ligated at [**Hospital3 27**].
She had a thoracotomy tube placed for 48 hours
postoperatively.  She again required dopamine support
postoperatively, was briefly off pressors until her clinical
deterioration on day of life 23.  She required dopamine to a
maximum of 35 mcg per kg per minute and epinephrine to a
maximum of 0.3 mg per kg prior to her death.

3.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION STATUS:  She required
parenteral nutrition and intravenous support with very brief
trophic feedings of breast milk.

4.  HEMATOLOGICAL STATUS:  She received multiple transfusions
in her last 24 hours of packed red blood cells and platelets.
Prior to that time, she had received five transfusions of
packed red blood cells for anemia of prematurity.

5.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE STATUS:  After admission, she was
started on ampicillin and gentamicin for risk factors.  Those
were discontinued initially after 48 hours when the blood
cultures were negative.  For a clinical presentation of
sepsis on day of life 6, she was again started on ampicillin
and gentamicin.  She completed a seven day course of those
antibiotics, although her blood cultures remained negative.
On day of life 13, she again had a clinical presentation of
sepsis.

She was started on vancomycin and gentamicin and
those were discontinued again after 48 hours and the blood
cultures remained negative.  On day of life 22, she had an
acute decompensation with persistent metabolic and
respiratory acidosis.  She was started on vancomycin and
gentamicin and ceftazidime. The blood cultures from the time of
her decompensation grew GNRs later shown to be pseudomonas.Her
clinical course was consistent with overwhelming sepsis with a
declining white blood cell count and platelet count in addition
to the persistent acidosis.

6.  NEUROLOGICAL STATUS:  She did have a head ultrasound on
day of life 1 that was within normal limits.  On [**3248-3-25**], she
had a head ultrasound that showed a choroid plexus cyst and
on day of life 23 the head ultrasound showed no choroid
plexus cyst present.

She had chromosomes sent on [**3248-3-24**] that were normal 46 XX.
She had a state screen sent on [**3-31**] that showed an increased
17 OH progesterone  It was repeated on [**4-1**].

7.  SOCIAL:  Her parents are married.  They have been very
involved in the infant's care.  The social worker from [**Hospital1 413**] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 166**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2276**].

On [**3248-4-16**], the infant had progressive deterioration after
multiple strategies for ventilatory support being
unsuccessful, including attempt at high frequency ventilation
and increasing in the epinephrine and bicarbonate continuous
intravenous infusion with no improvement.  Transillumination
showed a left pneumothorax which was evacuated with a needle
thoracentesis with continuous removal of air, but no
improvement in the infant's status.  The parents accepted the
offer to hold the infant and had a priest at the bedside with
them.  The infant expired in her mother's arms at 04:19.

Parents appear to be coping [**Last Name (un) **] at this time, as they slowly begin to integrate all the new information and medical issues that may arise for infant.
MD reviewed medical status, parents with appropriate questions.  Mother has been pumping, has good supply, and is encouraged by this.  Couple appear to be very supportive of each other, also encouraged to ask questions, given that they will need to incorporate a great deal of new information. 
Have talked with couple about long road ahead, and potential for [**Male First Name (un) 172**] course.  Will be available to meet with them as needed, provide support as they adjust to lengthy nicu course.

     INDICATION:  25 week preemie with known PDA.
     
     In follow up to [**3248-3-29**], the patient remains intubated with ETT just above the
     carina with the neck flexed.  There is now worsening collapse of the right
     upper lobe.  The remainder of the lungs are hyperinflated with a fine somewhat
     hazier interstitial pattern in keeping with RDS or some interstitial edema.
     The heart size is upper limits of normal.  A UVC terminates below the level of
     the right hemidiaphragm, perhaps within the ductus venosus and UAC terminates
     at T7-8.  Examination of the abdomen demonstrates featureless few mildly
     distended loops throughout in an overall nonspecific pattern.  No definite
     pneumatosis or portal venous gas.  Further follow up is needed.

Nutrition:  150 cc/kg/d TF.  NPO.  PN infusing via central PICC.  Projected intake from PN for next 24 hrs ~51 kcal/kg/d, ~3.6 g pro/kg/d, and no lipids (d/c'd today.) Projected glucose infusion rate from PN for next 24 hrs ~7.7 mg/kg/min.
GI:  hypoactive bowel sounds, abdomen soft and flat.  

A/Goals:
Infant w/ hyperglycemia over past ~18 hrs since lines changed and 1/2 NS d/c'd from UAC, with concurrent increase in PN rate causing increase in glucose infusion rate to ~9.8 mg/kg/min.  Current PN order has had dextrose content lowered to compensate for this.  Labs noted and PN adjusted accordingly; TG level noted to be 923, therefore IV lipids d/c'd.  Plan to recheck level.  Current PN not meeting recommendations for kcals/minerals due to above problems; meeting recommendations for pro and vits.  Do not expect growth to improve until kcal, pro and lipid recommendations are able to be met.  Plan now is to try to wean off dopamine, and then start feeds when able.  Will continue to follow w/ team and participate in nutrition plans.

     CHEST:
     
     Comparison is made with the exam done on [**3-31**].  Since that time the lungs have
     become much more opaque.  Of note in particular the right lobe is collapsed
     but the opacity is quite diffuse.  This could represent chronic lung disease
     so given the change since our last exam it could also represent acute as well
     such as edema or pneumonia.  The ETT is just above the carina.  A PICC line
     introduced from the left arm ends in the SVC.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Prematurity at 25 weeks gestation. RDS.
     
     FINDINGS: Single frontal view of the chest and abdomen was performed, in
     comparison with prior studies performed [**3248-4-3**] and [**3248-4-6**]. ETT terminates in
     mid thoracic trachea. NG tube tip projects just below the expected location of
     the GE junction, and could be advanced several mm. Several non-dilated gas
     filled loops of bowel are identified without definite radiographic evidence
     for necrotizing enterocolitis. There is air within the stomach.
     
     Hazy perihilar opacities would be consistent with mild pulmonary edema. This
     is increased slightly since the prior study of [**3248-4-6**]. No other interval
     change.

     CHEST AND ABDOMEN:  This is a baby who is s/p clipping of a patent ductus
     arteriosus.  Last exam was performed on the 9th.  Today's exam is little
     changed.  The ETT has been advanced to a point just above the carina.  The
     left pleural tube remains in place and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
     A PICC line introduced from the left arm reaches the SVC.  The lungs are
     slightly hazier than on a prior exam which may reflect continuing edema.

     FINDINGS: The current study is compared to the prior examination dated earlier
     the same day. There is a left sided chest tube in place with no evidence of
     residual pneumothorax. The ETT tube tip is in satisfactory position below the
     thoracic inlet and above the level of the carina. The ductus clip appears
     unchanged. The chest film is slightly rotated. Heart size is normal. The lungs
     are moderately inflated. There is a moderate ground glass appearance of the
     lung parenchyma bilaterally, improved compared to the prior examination. The
     abdominal bowel gas pattern is normal.

This has been a difficult few days for this family, hopeful now that infant will begin to improve.

Increased instability over course of day marked by hypotension and increased Fio2 requirement and metabolic acidosis. Has required increased PIP and rate to deal with CO2 retention. XRay shows paucity of bowel gas but with several slightly dilated featureless loops. No definitive evidence of NEC. Of note has significant hyponatremia to 121 116. K slightly elevated.

During afternoon we have given several NS boluses and begun transfusion with PRBCs. Started Dopamine infusion and increased it to current levels of 30 mcg/k/min. Total of 6 meq/kg of NaHCO3 have also been given to treat metabolic acidosis. Given hyponatremia, relative hyperkalemia and hypotension we have started stress doses of OH-cortisone (althouth addisonian crisis seems less likely given patients tolerance of thoracotomy earlier this week.) Urine output is decreased over course of day and may need Foley to assess urine flow. Pulses in legs remains unchanged and without significant differences between upper and lower extremities. We are checking TRG level as possible cause of pseudohyponatremia.

Most likely diagnosis appears to be sepsis syndrome. 

Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 165**] has spoken to family on several occasions during course of day and explained critical nature of patients illness. Family is said to be on their way to hospital.

Similarly respiratory support escalated with increasing pressures in face of fio2 1.0.  All pH values have been less than 7.2 with one exception despite bicarbonate drip increased to 2 meq/kg/hr.  Have given multiple volume boluses, including 40 cc/kg PRBC's, 20 cc/kg FFP, 20 cc/kg normal saline.

Called to bedside 2-3 hours ago for progressive hypotension and hypoxemia requiring continuous hand bagging.  Multiple ventilation strategies attempted with bag, simv, and a brief trial of HFOV.  Maximal SaO2 0.75 despite various maneuvers.  pH 7.09.  Additional administration of bicarbonate given.  Calcium gluconate administered with resulting ionized calcium 1.3.  Epi drip continued.

Further deterioration noted around 0200 with undetectable SaO2 and mean bp to high teens.  Transilliumination showed left pneumothorax.  This was evacuated with needle thoracentesis without significant improvement in either Sa02 or blood pressure.

Parents at bedside and left room during thoracentesis.  Team discussed clinical deterioration and consensus was that this was pre-terminal event.  Explained to family that thoracostomy tube could be placed and it was extremely unlikely- given her most recent course and poor response to thoracentesis- that this would result in survival.  Also explained that regimen over most recent hours involved continuous administration of ""code meds"" and that there was little more that could be provided pharmacologically.

Family accepted offer to hold [**Known patient lastname 579**].  Infant placed back on SIMV and monitors discontinued.  Parents are now sitting in rockers while holding her.  A priest has been requested by family.

We have just learned from lab that blood culture from [**3245**] on [**4-14**] is growing gram negative rods.
