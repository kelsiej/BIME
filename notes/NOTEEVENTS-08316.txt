Admission Date:  [**3431-8-5**]       Discharge Date:  [**3431-8-16**]

Date of Birth:   [**3347-7-24**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CARDIAC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84-year-old woman who
was admitted to [**Hospital3 1942**] Hospital on [**3431-8-4**],
and ruled in for a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction by
enzymes and electrocardiogram criteria.  She subsequently
developed postinfarction angina and was referred to the [**Hospital6 293**] for cardiac catheterization
on [**3431-8-5**].

Cardiac catheterization at that time demonstrated that she
had a left dominant system.  There was an 80% stenosis of the
left main coronary artery, severe obstructions of the left
anterior descending, first diagonal, distal circumflex, and
left posterior descending coronary arteries.  The right
coronary artery was occluded and diminutive.  An
echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 40%.

On [**8-7**], Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted and
evaluated the patient.  At that time it was recommended that
the patient undergo coronary artery bypass grafting.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Diltiazem ER 240 mg p.o. q.d.,
Isosorbide 90 mg p.o. q.d., Accupril 40 mg p.o. q.d.,
Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.d., ASA 81 mg p.o. q.d., Gabapentin
300 mg p.o. q.h.s.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.2��, pulse
52, blood pressure 120/60, respirations 18.  General:  She
was awake and comfortable and was pleasant.  HEENT:  Pupils
equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements
intact.  Neck:  Supple.  No jugular venous distention.
Heart:  Regular, rate and rhythm.  No murmurs.  Lungs:  Clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Protuberant, but
soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  Warm and well perfused without edema.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Chronic renal insufficiency with a
creatinine of 2.0.  Coronary artery disease.  Hypertension.
Gout.  Arthritis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the
Medicine Service where she underwent the aforementioned
studies.  Her surgery was delayed because of a bump in her
creatinine to a peak of 3.0, thought to be secondary to acute
tubular necrosis from the cardiac catheterization.

On [**8-8**], the patient underwent a vein mapping which
revealed that the right greater saphenous and bilateral
lesser saphenous veins were all patent.  This study failed to
identify a left greater saphenous vein.

Over the days leading up to her surgery, her creatinine began
to drop indicative of resolution of her acute tubular
necrosis.  She had isolated episodes of anginal pain treated
with Lopressor.  On [**3431-8-10**], the patient underwent
and uncomplicated aorto-coronary bypass graft times three
with a left internal mammary to the left anterior descending,
reversed autogenous saphenous vein to the first diagonal and
circumflex marginal coronary arteries.  The patient tolerated
the procedure well and was transported to the Cardiothoracic
Surgery Intensive Care Unit, intubated, stable, and in good
condition.

The patient remained intubated over night.  She was found to
have a lactic acidosis and was receiving bicarb.  She had a
low urine output and a low cardiac index; she was given
Hespan and started on a Dobutamine and Neo-Synephrine drip.
She underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram which was
significant for a hypokinetic inferior wall with good left
ventricular function and mild mitral regurgitation and trace
tricuspid regurgitation.  The heart was noted to be
underfilled.  The patient was being AV paced, and no ectopy
was noted.  Her creatinine had declined to baseline levels,
and she was making 30-45 cc/hr of urine.

By the morning of postoperative day #2, the patient's
Neo-Synephrine drips had been weaned.  She was placed on CPAP
and was continuing to be paced.  Her urine output remained
adequate, and her lactate level declined to 2.8.  The patient
tolerated CPAP and was extubated.  Her chest tube was
removed.  The patient was weaned from the ventilator and was
extubated.

On postoperative day #3, the patient had been noted to have a
few episodes of premature atrial contractions after her
Neo-Synephrine drip was discontinued.  Her pacemaker was
turned off, and the patient was in normal sinus rhythm at a
rate of 86-88.  She was noted to be in first degree AV block
without ectopy.  By postoperative day #4, her Dobutamine drip
had been discontinued, and her cardiac index was above 2.0.
She continued to undergo her Lasix diuresis putting out
greater than 400 cc/hr.  As the patient was deemed stable and
in good condition, her Swan-Ganz catheter was removed, and
she was transferred to the floor.

On postoperative day #5, the patient was in stable
cardiopulmonary condition.  She was making good urine.  Her
pressures and heart rate were stable.  Her Foley was
discontinued, and she was ready for rehabilitation placement.
On postoperative day #6, the patient obtained a bed and was
subsequently discharged to rehabilitation in stable
condition.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d., Lasix
20 mg p.o. b.i.d., Potassium Chloride 20 mEq p.r.n., Colace
100 mg p.o. b.i.d., Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d., Percocet [**11-30**] tab
p.o. q.3-4 hours p.r.n. pain, Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.,
Combivent MDI 2 puffs inhaled q.4 hours p.r.n., Gabapentin
300 mg q.h.s.

DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
97.4��, heart rate 79, blood pressure 126/64, respirations 18,
oxygen saturation 89-91% on room air.  Neck:  Supple.  Lungs:
Clear with slightly coarse breath sounds bilaterally.  Her
sternum was stable, clean, dry and intact.  Heart:  Regular,
rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen:  Her
belly was soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:  Warm
and well perfused.  Her incision was clean, dry and intact.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass grafting.
2.  Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.

DISPOSITION:  The patient is discharged to rehabilitation in
stable condition.

     HISTORY: 84 y/o woman with CAD, postop from CABG.
     
     Comparison to prior study from [**3431-8-9**].
     
     PORTABLE CHEST: The patient is s/p CABG. A left sided chest tube and
     mediastinal drain have been placed. The distal portion of the Swan-Ganz
     catheter is difficult to identify due to multiple overlying tubes and wires,
     though the tip is in the right main pulmonary artery. The ETT is in a low
     position, terminating approximately 1 cm above the carina and directed towards
     the right main stem bronchus. The NG tube is in the stomach with the side hole
     just below the GE junction. Again noted is cardiac enlargement with unfolding
     of the thoracic aorta. The pulmonary vasculature is normal and there is no
     evidence of pleural effusion. Minimal left mid lung zone atelectasis is seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) S/P CABG with left sided chest tube and mediastinal drain in place. No
     evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
     
     2) Low positioning of ETT, with tip approximately 1 cm above carina directed
     towards the right main stem bronchus. Repositioning recommended.
