Admission Date:  [**3356-12-30**]     Discharge Date:  [**3357-1-12**]

Date of Birth:   [**3276-1-12**]     Sex:  M

Service:  NEUROLOGY

ADDENDUM:

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE CORRECTED:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once daily.
2.  Acetaminophen 325 to 650 mg p.o. q4-6hours p.r.n. fever
or pain.
3.  Keppra 1000 mg p.o. twice a day.
4.  Tegretol 200 mg p.o. twice a day and an additional 400 mg
p.o. q.noon.
5.  Miconazole Powder.
6.  Famotidine 20 mg p.o. twice a day.
7.  Atenolol 37.5 mg p.o. once daily.
8.  Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. once daily.
9.  Fludrocortisone 0.1 mg p.o. three times a week on Monday,
Wednesday and Saturday.
10. Heparin subcutaneously 5000 units q12hours.
11. Valacyclovir one gram p.o. twice a day for three days.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  After discussion, it was determined that
the patient did receive a full eleven day course of
intravenous Acyclovir for presumed HSV encephalitis.  There
have been conflicting reports about the actual duration
needed for effective treatment for the HSV encephalitis.  It
is indicated that ten days appears to be a full course,
however, with other sources indicating fourteen to twenty-one
days of being a more usual duration of antiviral treatment,
we decided to finish his course of antiviral treatment with
three days of Valacyclovir p.o. at one gram p.o. twice a day.
Although we suspect that he most likely did not actually have
HSV encphalitis, we cannot be sure and opted to complete the
treatment as above. The patient is to follow-up with his
neurologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], on [**3357-1-19**], as well as Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1896**] in the Neurology Clinic on

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      80 year old man with ?sz now unresponsive                                       
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      r/o mass, please obtain cuts through palate mass seen on CT                     
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Unresponsive with question of seizure.  Assess nasal mass seen on
     prior CT.
     
     COMPARISON:  Head CT [**3356-12-30**] and [**3356-9-3**]; brain MRI [**11-7**],2003.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2-weighted gadolinium-enhanced MR of the brain
     with susceptibility.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is a moderate amount of brain atrophy.  Diffuse increased
     FLAIR signal in the periventricular white matter areas and punctate increased
     FLAIR signal in the subcortical white matter areas is likely related to
     chronic microvascular infarction.  There is no evidence of abnormal
     susceptibility artifact to suggest intracranial hemorrhage.  There is no mass
     effect, shift of normally midline structures, or hydrocephalus.  There is
     fluid within the mastoid air cells bilaterally.
     
     Within the anterior maxilla, there is a 2.9 x 3.5 cm lobulated mass lesion
     which demonstrates heterogeneous, moderately increased T2 signal and which
     does not enhance.  This was present on the prior MR study of [**3356-10-30**],
     but was not included in the field of imaging on the prior CT scan of [**9-4**], 2003. There is no associated high signal within the adjacent bone.
     
     Additional note is made of a 1.7 x 1.3 cm mass within the left parotid gland
     which enhances and likely represents a pleomorphic adenoma, with an intra-
     parotid lymph node being a secondary possibility.  This is unlikely to be
     related to the maxillary mass described above.
     
     No other areas of abnormal contrast enhancement are appreciated.  Several
     sequences are degraded by patient motion.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Chronic-appearing, non-enhancing mass within the anterior maxilla.  Signal
     intensity of this may represent fluid, as might be found in an incisive canal
     cyst, or it may be cartilaginous in origin, possibly emanating from the nasal
     septum.
     2.  Left parotid gland mass, likely reflecting a pleomorphic adenoma.
     3.  Mastoid fluid bilaterally.
                                                                 (Over)

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT *ABNORMAL!
     HISTORY:  Acute change in mental status.  Eyes deviated to the right. Evaluate
     for bleed.
     
     COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to prior head CT from [**3356-9-3**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is a bilobed CSF density lesion posterior to the left
     cerebellar hemisphere which has been previously described and has imaging
     characteristics consistent with a giant cisterna magna.  This is unchanged.
     There is global brain atrophy.  There is hypodensity in the periventricular
     white matter consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic change.  There are
     no major vascular territorial infarcts.  There is no intracranial hemorrhage.
     
     There is a fluid density lesion located in the subcutaneous tissues anterior
     to the subcutaneous tissues just below the nose related to the upper lip.
     There is destruction of a portion of the anterior wall of the left maxillary
     sinus and the anterior portions of the hard palate.  This lesion is
     incompletely imaged and was not included in the field of view on the prior
     head CT.  However, this was present on [**11-7**] MRI and is unchanged in
     size since that time.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial pathology. Destructive lesion involving the
     anterior hard palate and left maxillary sinus which is incompletely imaged but
     appears unchanged in size since the MRI from [**3356-11-6**].  This may
     represent an infectious source such as a peridental abscess.  Clinical
     correlation is suggested and correlation with physical exam is suggested.
     Additional imaging of the facial bones could be considered to better
     characterize the location and characteristics of this lesion.

     PORTABLE AP CHEST:
     
     INDICATION:  Seizure.
     
     Since the previous cxr  of [**3356-11-17**], there has been placement of an NG tube
     which terminates in the stomach with tip cephalad in the region of the fundus.
     Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits for portable
     technique. There is a new patchy alveolar opacity in the right perihilar
     region.  There may be an additional area of opacity at the left base, as the
     left hemidiaphragm is not as well demonstrated on the prior exam.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Patchy right perihilar alveolar opacity and possible additional
     left basilar opacity.  In a patient with h/o seizure, aspiration should be
     considered.  Infectious pneumonia is also possible.

     The heart shows slight LV enlargement.  The pulmonary vessels are within
     normal limits, allowing for posture.  There is again evidence of ill-defined
     patchy pulmonary infiltrates/atelecatasis in both lung bases.  There is also
     blunting of the left cp angle, suggesting a  small effusion.  These findings
     could be due to aspiration pneumonitis.  An ET tube is noted extending into
     the lower portion of the stomach.  Bilateral [**Location (un) 766**] rods are again noted
     in the lumbar region.
     
     IMPRESSION:  The appearances are essentially unchanged since [**1-2**].  Bibasilar
     pulmonary infiltrates are noted, consistent with aspiration pneumonitis.
     There is minimal improvement at this time, if any.

     INDICATION:  Fluctuating loss of consciousness.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1 and T2 images of the brain pre contrast, T1 coronal
     images post contrast.  Susceptibility, FLAIR, and diffusion-weighted images
     were also obtained.  13 cc of Magnevist was used for this examination.
     
     Comparison is made to [**3356-12-30**].
     
     FINDINGS:
     MRI OF THE BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT GADOLINIUM:
     
     There is a moderate amount of brain atrophy with widening of the sulci and
     ventricles bilaterally, unchanged from the prior study.  FLAIR images
     demonstrate several areas of bilateral punctate increased signal intensity
     within the periventricular white matter consistent with small vessel ischemic
     disease, also unchanged from the prior study.  There are no new areas of
     increased signal intensity.
     
     Diffusion-weighted images show no areas of abnormally slowed diffusion.
     Susceptibility images show no areas of abnormal susceptibility artifact to
     suggest acute intracranial hemorrhage.  There is no shift of normally midline
     structures noted.  There is no abnormal enhancement on post-gadolinium images
     to suggest parenchymal mass.  The hippocampi and temporal lobes appear
     symmetric, and are unchanged in appearance from the prior study.
     
     Again is noted a lobulated mass lesion in the anterior maxilla which shows
     increased T2 signal and no enhancement post contrast.  This is also unchanged
     in appearance.  There is mucosal thickening in the right maxillary sinus.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute infarction or intracranial hemorrhage.  No
     parenchymal mass lesion is noted on the post-contrast images.  Symmetric
     appearance to the hippocampi and temporal lobes without evidence of acute

     FINDINGS: The image quality is somewhat degraded by patient motion. There is
     no evidence of intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage. There is no shift of normally
     midline structures or mass effect. The ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are
     prominent but unchanged.
     
     There is a bilobed CSF density lesion posterior to the left cerebellar
     hemisphere which is unchanged and likely represents a giant cisterna magna.
     
     There is hypoattenuation of the periventricular white matter consistent with
     chronic microvascular angiopathy. The [**Doctor Last Name 30**]-white matter differentiation is
     preserved. There are no ossseous or soft tissue abnormalities. The mastoid air
     cells and visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.

     HISTORY:  Sepsis.  Clinical suspicion for urinary tract infection or C.
     difficile colits as source of infection.
     
     COMPARISON:  No prior studies.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung bases to the pubic symphysis with oral contrast and 150 cc of IV optiray.
      Coronal reconstructions were performed.
     
     ABDOMEN CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  Atelectasis present at both lung bases.  There
     are several small low-attenuation lesions within the liver, which are
     nonspecific in appearance.  There is a large calcified granuloma within the
     upper pole of the spleen.  The gallbladder, pancreas and adrenal glands are
     unremarkable.  Multiple renal cysts are present bilaterally, with the largest
     cyst in the upper pole of the right kidney measures 4.2 x 5.1 cm.  The
     nasogastric tube terminates within the stomach.  There is no mesenteric or
     retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  There is no free air or free fluid.
     
     There is an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 5.3 cm in AP
     diameter and 4.7 cm in transverse diameter.  The aneurysm contains a large
     anterior thrombus.  The celiac, superior mesenteric, inferior mesenteric and
     bilateral renal arteries are patent.  Incidental note is made of a replaced
     right hepatic artery.
     
     PELVIC CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is diffuse thickening of the colon wall,
     consistent with pancolitis.  If there is a confirmed C. difficile infection,
     then this represents C. difficile colitis.  Otherwise, other infectious or
     inflammatory causes cannot be distinguished.  There is no perforation or
     abscess. The small bowel is unremarkable. The prostate is markedly enlarged,
     measuring 6 x 7 cm. There is bladder wall thickening, probably secondary to
     prostatic enlargement. A Foley catheter is seen within the bladder.  There is
     no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Surgical rods are present within the lumbar spine.  There are
     no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions within the visualized osseous
     structures.

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     HISTORY:  Sepsis.  Clinical suspicion for urinary tract infection or C.
     difficile colits as source of infection.
     
     COMPARISON:  No prior studies.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung bases to the pubic symphysis with oral contrast and 150 cc of IV optiray.
      Coronal reconstructions were performed.
     
     ABDOMEN CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  Atelectasis present at both lung bases.  There
     are several small low-attenuation lesions within the liver, which are
     nonspecific in appearance.  There is a large calcified granuloma within the
     upper pole of the spleen.  The gallbladder, pancreas and adrenal glands are
     unremarkable.  Multiple renal cysts are present bilaterally, with the largest
     cyst in the upper pole of the right kidney measures 4.2 x 5.1 cm.  The
     nasogastric tube terminates within the stomach.  There is no mesenteric or
     retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  There is no free air or free fluid.
     
     There is an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 5.3 cm in AP
     diameter and 4.7 cm in transverse diameter.  The aneurysm contains a large
     anterior thrombus.  The celiac, superior mesenteric, inferior mesenteric and
     bilateral renal arteries are patent.  Incidental note is made of a replaced
     right hepatic artery.
     
     PELVIC CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is diffuse thickening of the colon wall,
     consistent with pancolitis.  If there is a confirmed C. difficile infection,
     then this represents C. difficile colitis.  Otherwise, other infectious or
     inflammatory causes cannot be distinguished.  There is no perforation or
     abscess. The small bowel is unremarkable. The prostate is markedly enlarged,
     measuring 6 x 7 cm. There is bladder wall thickening, probably secondary to
     prostatic enlargement. A Foley catheter is seen within the bladder.  There is
     no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Surgical rods are present within the lumbar spine.  There are
     no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions within the visualized osseous
     structures.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Coronal reconstructions confirm the presence of diffuse
                                                                 (Over)

     VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW:  The study was performed in conjunction with the
     speech and swallow service.  Various consistencies of barium were administered
     to the patient.  With thin consistencies there is spillover into the piriform
     sinuses both before and after the swallow phase with trace penetration.  There
     is trace aspiration of thin consistencies after the swallow from the residue
     spilling over from the piriform sinuses.  There is a spontaneous cough
     associated with this trace aspiration however it is not fully effective.
     Acute cough is more effective.  A 13 mm barium pill passes freely without
     holdup.  For full details please see the speech swallow report in the
     patient's online medical record.
     
     IMPRESSION: Trace aspiration of thin consistencies.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: 81 y/o male with clostridium difficile colitis, scrotal erythema and
     enlarged right scrotum.
     
     FINDINGS: There is a moderate right hydrocele. The right epididymal head
     contains a few small cysts, the largest of which is approximately 5 mm in
     diameter. There is increased flow throughout the right epididymal head and
     markedly increased flow, size and heterogeneity of the tail of the right
     epididymis. The right epididymal tail measures approximately 2.6 cm by 2.2 cm
     in diameter. The right testicle is homogeneous in appearance without mass or
     increased flow. The left testicle is normal in appearance and homogeneous in
     echo texture without intratesticular mass or increased flow. The left
     epididymal head contains a 5 mm rounded anechoic cyst, the left epididymal
     tail is grossly normal in appearance. There is a small amount of fluid
     adjacent to the left testicle. Normal pulsatile flow can be visualized in both
     testicles.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) Severe epididymitis on the right with a moderate right
     hydrocele and a small left hydrocele. Findings were called to house staff at
     approximately 15:07 hours.

     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images through the brain without IV contrast.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3357-1-26**].
     
     There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage or shift of normally midline
     structures.  The sulci and ventricles are prominent consistent with age-
     related atrophy.  There are several scattered hypodensities in the subcortical
     white matter consistent with small vessel ischemic disease.  These are
     unchanged from the prior study.
     
     The osseous structures are unremarkable.  The mastoid air cells and visualized
     paranasal sinuses are clear.  The soft tissues are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial hemorrhage.  Unchanged appearance of the
     brain.

     seen right internal jugular central venous line has been removed.  The cardiac
     size is upper limits of normal.  There is no overt CHF or pleural effusion.
     The previously seen right upper lobe and possibly middle lobe opacity is
     improved.  There is a patchy area of opacity within the right lower lobe,
     particularly the superior segment, which is suspicious for early pneumonia.
     There is improved aeration of the left lower lobe.  There is increased opacity
     in the retrocardiac left lower lobe as well which could be atelectasis or
     early pneumonia. Calcified pleural plaques are present bilaterally.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Likely early right lower lobe pneumonia.  Left lower lobe
     atelectasis versus early pneumonia.

     HISTORY: An 81-year-old man with lower abdominal tenderness.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Multiple axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained
     without IV contrast.  No IV contrast was given secondary to the patient's
     elevated creatinine.  Oral contrast was used.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH ORAL CONTRAST AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: A few images
     through the lung bases demonstrate subsegmental atelectasis of the right lower
     lobe.  There is minimal dependent atelectasis at the left base as well.
     
     Evaluation of intraabdominal organs is limited due to the lack of IV contrast.
     Given this limitation, the liver spleen and pancreas are unremarkable.  There
     is no significant change from [**3357-1-20**].  There are numerous cysts seen in both
     kidneys, unchanged.  Evaluation of these cysts is limited due to the lack of
     IV contrast.  The loops of bowel are unremarkable. There is no bowel wall
     thickening.  There is no free-air or free-fluid in the abdomen.  Oral contrast
     reaches the sigmoid colon.  There is no diverticulosis or diverticulitis.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a Foley catheter in the bladder
     which is relatively decompresssed with a focus of air present within it
     presumably Foley catheter insertion.  The prostate is enlarged, unchanged.
     Again seen is an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 5.4 x 4.6 cm,
     unchanged.

     ABDOMEN.
     
     HISTORY:  Urinary retention.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3357-8-22**].
     
     L1 through L4 are transfixed with [**Location (un) 766**] rods.  Bowel gas pattern is non-
     specific.  Compared to the prior study, the large soft tissue opacity in the
     lower mid-pelvis is not seen.  Presumably, this was a very distended bladder
     on the prior study.  However, clinical correlation is advised.
     
     IMPRESSION:  The previously noted large opacity in the mid-pelvis is no longer
     seen on today's film.  Clinical correlation is advised.

     HRC PATIENT #H76042.
     
     LEFT RIBS WITH AP CHEST.
     
     INDICATION:  Pain left posterior chest wall status-post fall.  Assess for
     fracture.
     
     FINDINGS:  Allowing for dark radiographic technique, no obvious left-sided rib
     fractures are detected.  Fusion rods are noted in the upper lumbar spine.  A
     roughly 1.5 cm rounded calcification is seen in the left upper quadrant, felt
     to be of no clinical significance.
     
     The chest, compared with [**3357-6-27**], shows no acute process.  The lungs are
     clear.  No pneumothorax, effusion, or CHF.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No acute process identified in the left ribs or chest.

     official interpretation only.
     
     HRC PATIENT #31982.
     
     HISTORY:  Fever and right lower lobe rales.
     
     CHEST, ONE VIEW:
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3357-6-27**].
     
     The heart is enlarged with an LV configuration.  There is minor atelectasis at
     the left base.  There is no vascular congestion, focal area of consolidation,
     or pleural effusion.  There is no significant change from the prior exam
     allowing for differences in inspiration.  There is suggestion of an old
     fracture involving the right proximal humerus.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe atelectasis.  No focal pneumonia, particularly on
     the right in the area of clinical concern.
