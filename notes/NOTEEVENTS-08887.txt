IMAGING: [**1-13**] CTA: CTA OF THE CHEST:  There is no evidence of 
pulmonary embolism.  There is atherosclerotic disease of the 
aorta and great vessels, notably with narrowing of the left 
subclavian vein lumen proximally unchanged compared to the 
previous study.  There are multiple small mediastinal lymph[**MD Number 510**] that do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.  
There is no pericardial or pleural effusion.  There is no 
pneumothorax.  The airways appear patent to the level of the 
segmental bronchi bilaterally.  Lungs show minimal dependent 
atelectasis. BONE WINDOWS:  There is a stable mild compression 
fracture of T12 with minimal retropulsion of the superior 
endplate towards the spinal canal. Note is again made of an 
atrophic right kidney with a 4.6 cm nonobstructing stone at its 
lower pole, seen on limited images of the upper abdomen. 
.
[**3221-1-14**] CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary process. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
# GIB: upper GIB, secondary to PUD in conjunction with Ibuprofen 
consumption over the last days. GI was consulted on this patient 
and did an EGD on the first day of hospitalization which 
revealed duodenal ulcers one of whichrequired cautery to stop 
slow ooze of blood.  The patient remained hemodynamically stable 
and without  hematemesis.  She was transferred to the floor, 
where her hematocrit remained stable, she tolerated a PO diet 
and remained symptom free.  She was started on a PPI twice 
daily.  H pylori serologies were sent; results were pending at 
the time of discharge.  The patient was instructed to follow up 
with her PCP for these results. 
.
# Adrenal carcinoma: no evidence of recurrence, but concerning 
in the context of weight loss since THR. Mitotane was held 
throughout her hospitalization and restarted upon discharge.
.
# Adrenal insufficiency: absolute insufficiency in the context 
of bilateral resection.  The patient was given stress dose 
steroids with hydrocortisone 100mg Q6h, which covers 
glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoid activity for 24 hours, 
then was restarted on her home regimen of dexamethasone and 
fludrocortisone. 

# Hypothyroid- the patient was continued on her outpatient 
regimen.
