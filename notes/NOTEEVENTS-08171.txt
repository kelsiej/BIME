HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80-year-old
man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation and
hypothyroidism who was initially transferred from [**Hospital 934**]
hospital after an episode of hemoptysis on [**2737-4-16**].  The
patient developed respiratory distress and coughed up 300 to
400 cc of blood.  Bronchoscopy at the outside hospital
revealed a large exophytic tumor in the right mainstem.  The
patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 47**] on [**2737-4-17**] for rigid bronchoscopy.

disease.  2. Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction
of 30%.  3. Chronic atrial fibrillation.  4. Hypothyroidism.
5. Right upper lobe lung mass consistent with adenocarcinoma
diagnosed with outside hospital thoracentesis (stage IIIb).  6.
Prior hemothorax/hemorrhagic effusion, patient failed pleurodesis
x 2. 7. Upper GI bleed/peptic ulcer disease; EGD on [**2737-3-20**],
[**2737-4-3**].  8. Delirium.

patient was sedated.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission the white count was 14.0,
hematocrit 29.6, INR 1.3.

OUTSIDE HOSPITAL STUDIES:
1. Chest x-ray demonstrated a left pleural effusion and right
hilar fullness.
2. Chest and abdomen CT from [**2737-3-23**] demonstrated bibasilar
atelectasis and porcelain gallbladder.
3. EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 90,
normal axis, left ventricular hypertrophy, ST depression 1 mm
in V2 through V6, T wave inversions in leads 1 and 2.

     HISTORY: Patient with lung cancer, hemoptysis.
     
     There are no prior films available for comparison. The heart is slightly
     enlarged. Extensive chronic changes are present bilaterally. Considerable
     opacification at the left base is present which may reflect pleural fluid or
     consolidation in the left lower lobe. An endotracheal tube is present
     terminating approximately 4 cm above the carina.
     
     There are a few faint calcifications in the upper lobes indicative of prior
     granulomatous disease.
     
     The density of left hilum is somewhat increased raising the question of hilar
     adenopathy.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Cardiomegaly with proximal parenchymal changes at the left base.
     
     2. Question left hilar adenopathy.

     TWO VIEWS CHEST:
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Adenocarcinoma.  Wheezing.
     
     Comparison is made to recent study of [**2737-4-17**].
     
     The patient is markedly rotated towards the right, limiting assessment of the
     cardiac and mediastinal contours.  Even allowing for this factor, the heart
     appears enlarged.  The pulmonary vascularity is engorged and there is
     perihilar haziness and peribronchial cuffing.  There is also an asymmetric
     interstitial pattern affecting the left lung to a greater degree than the
     right which has progressed in the interval.  Small pleural effusions are seen
     bilaterally.
     
     Cystic changes are noted in the upper lobes suggesting underlying emphysema.
     A few small granulomas are present in the left lung.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Findings most suggestive of congestive heart failure superimposed on
     underlying emphysema.  Known adenocarcinoma is not well demonstrated on this
     portable CXR in the setting of CHF. Correlative CT may be helpful.
     2)  Small bilateral pleural effusions.

     HISTORY:  Eighty-year-old man with recently diagnosed adenocarcinoma of the  
     lung.  Evaluate for metastases.
     
     INTERPRETATION:  Whole body views of the skeleton show a subtle focus of mildly
     increased tracer activity located at the right-[**Hospital1 786**] aspect of the T10 vertebral
     body.  No other abnormal foci are identified. 
     
     The kidneys and urinary bladder are visualized, the normal route of tracer
     excretion.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Subtle focus of increased tracer activity at the T10 vertebral body
     level.  The differential diagnosis for this appearance includes focal
     degenerative change vs a solitary metastasis.  The patient subsequently
     underwent CT of the torso which will be reported separately. /nkg

     CLINICAL HISTORY:  Adenocarcinoma of the lung.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung apices to the pubic symphysis after the administration of 150 cc of
     Optiray contrast intravenously.  Pre contrast and early phase imaging was
     obtained through the liver.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     CT CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is cardiomegaly with four chamber
     enlargement.  There is no pericardial effusion.  The great vessels are
     unremarkable.  There are small lymph nodes identified in the AP window,
     pretracheal and subcarinal regions as well as anterior to the right main stem
     bronchus, the latter is the largest measuring approximately 1.5 x 2.2 cm.
     There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.  There are small bilateral pleural
     effusions.  The lung parenchyma is notable for extensive emphysematous changes
     predominantly at the lung apices where there is associated scarring.  There is
     no definite mass in the pulmonary parenchyma.  There is increased
     opacification at the left lung base with a nodular component in the
     posteromedial area which all appears chronic in nature.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The liver is notable for an
     area of low attenuation adjacent to the falciform ligament consistent with
     focal fatty infiltration.  The gallbladder is grossly abnormal with a
     calcified thickened wall as well as either internal septations or gallstones.
     There is no definite mass associated with the gallbladder.  Multiple punctate
     calcifications are seen within the spleen, consistent with prior granulomatous
     disease.  The pancreas is normal.  The left adrenal gland appears prominent
     and rounded.  The right adrenal gland is normal.  The left kidney is notable
     for a simple cyst in the midpole.  The right kidney is normal.  The kidneys
     enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically and the ureters are normal.  The
     visualized loops of contrast opacified bowel are normal.  The abdominal aorta
     is extensively calcified.  There is no lymphadenopathy or free fluid.  A
     moderate hiatal hernia is noted.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Sigmoid diverticula are present.  The
     rectum is normal.  The prostate gland is enlarged.  The distal ureters and
     urinary bladder are normal.  There is no free fluid or lymphadenopathy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Degenerative changes are noted in the lumbar spine.  In

     disease.  The pancreas is normal.  The left adrenal gland appears prominent
     and rounded.  The right adrenal gland is normal.  The left kidney is notable
     for a simple cyst in the midpole.  The right kidney is normal.  The kidneys
     enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically and the ureters are normal.  The
     visualized loops of contrast opacified bowel are normal.  The abdominal aorta
     is extensively calcified.  There is no lymphadenopathy or free fluid.  A
     moderate hiatal hernia is noted.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Sigmoid diverticula are present.  The
     rectum is normal.  The prostate gland is enlarged.  The distal ureters and
     urinary bladder are normal.  There is no free fluid or lymphadenopathy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Degenerative changes are noted in the lumbar spine.  In
                                                                 (Over)

     vertebral body.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy with no definite pulmonary
     mass seen.  There is rounded fullness to the left adrenal gland and a
     metastasis cannot be excluded.
     2.  Chronic changes in the left lower lobe with small bilateral pleural
     effusions.
     3.  Emphysematous changes, particularly extensive at the lung apices.
     4.  Cardiomegaly.
     5.  Thickened gallbladder wall with calcifications consistent with porcelain
     gallbladder with possible internal septations of the gallbladder.  Neoplastic
     process cannot be excluded.
     6.  Punctate calcifications in the spleen consistent with prior granulomatous
     disease.
     7.  Hiatal hernia.
     8.  Diverticulosis.
     9.  Enlarged prostate gland.
     10. Minimally displaced fracture of the right transverse process of the L1
     vertebral body.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  Adenocarcinoma of the lung.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung apices to the pubic symphysis after the administration of 150 cc of
     Optiray contrast intravenously.  Pre contrast and early phase imaging was
     obtained through the liver.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     CT CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is cardiomegaly with four chamber
     enlargement.  There is no pericardial effusion.  The great vessels are
     unremarkable.  There are small lymph nodes identified in the AP window,
     pretracheal and subcarinal regions as well as anterior to the right main stem
     bronchus, the latter is the largest measuring approximately 1.5 x 2.2 cm.
     There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.  There are small bilateral pleural
     effusions.  The lung parenchyma is notable for extensive emphysematous changes
     predominantly at the lung apices where there is associated scarring.  There is
     no definite mass in the pulmonary parenchyma.  There is increased
     opacification at the left lung base with a nodular component in the
     posteromedial area which all appears chronic in nature.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The liver is notable for an
     area of low attenuation adjacent to the falciform ligament consistent with
     focal fatty infiltration.  The gallbladder is grossly abnormal with a
     calcified thickened wall as well as either internal septations or gallstones.
     There is no definite mass associated with the gallbladder.  Multiple punctate
     calcifications are seen within the spleen, consistent with prior granulomatous
     disease.  The pancreas is normal.  The left adrenal gland appears prominent
     and rounded.  The right adrenal gland is normal.  The left kidney is notable
     for a simple cyst in the midpole.  The right kidney is normal.  The kidneys
     enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically and the ureters are normal.  The
     visualized loops of contrast opacified bowel are normal.  The abdominal aorta
     is extensively calcified.  There is no lymphadenopathy or free fluid.  A
     moderate hiatal hernia is noted.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Sigmoid diverticula are present.  The
     rectum is normal.  The prostate gland is enlarged.  The distal ureters and
     urinary bladder are normal.  There is no free fluid or lymphadenopathy.
