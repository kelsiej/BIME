Radiology
CT Abdomen:
FINDINGS:  The evaluation of the great vessels and mediastinum 
is somewhat 
limited due to lack of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 614**].  No 
significant mediastinal lymphadenopathy is noted.  Coronary 
arteries are calcified.  The heart is enlarged in size.  The 
patient is status post CABG with median sternotomy. Note is made 
of bilateral pleural effusion, somewhat larger on the left, 
partially loculated.  There is interlobar effusion on the left 
as well.  In the lung window, note is made of diffuse 
ground-glass opacity with interlobular septal thickening 
predominantly in central distribution involving upper lobes, as 
well as lower lobes and middle lobes.  There is somewhat focal 
patchy opacity in right middle lobe and lower lobes.  Mucous 
secretion in the trachea is seen, however, no central 
obstructing lesion is noted.  NG tube is noted, with the tip 
terminating in the stomach.  There is no suspicious lytic or 
blastic lesion.  Small bone islands are seen in lower thoracic 
vertebra. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Moderate amount of pleural effusion, larger on the left and 
somewhat 
loculated on the left, associated with basilar atelectasis.  
Interlobar 
effusion on the left. 
2.  Diffuse ground-glass opacity predominantly in central 
distribution, 
associated with smooth interlobular septal thickening 
bilaterally involving upper and lower lobes.  The finding may 
represent pulmonary edema as mentioned in the report of prior 
chest radiograph, however, in the appropriate clinical setting, 
superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  Other possibility 
includes alveolar hemorrhage if the patient has hemoptysis.  
Please correlate clinically. 
3.  Patchy opacities in the right middle and lower lobes, which 
may be part of diffuse process mentioned in #2, however, please 
perform followup study after effusion and ground-glass opacities 
have resolved. 
4.  Cardiomegaly, status post CABG and coronary artery 
calcification. 
.
Echocardiogram:
Conclusions:  
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is 
moderately dilated.  Left ventricular wall thicknesses are 
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There 
is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction 
20-30 percent). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left 
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic 
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.  
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no 
mitral valve  
prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
There is no pericardial effusion.  
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) 
of [**2933-2-4**], no major change is evident.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient expired on [**2933-7-24**] after a prolonged 
hospitalization.  I will briefly outline his medical problems 
leading up to his death.
.  
# Syncope: Patient came in to the hospital secondary to being 
found unresponsive by his wife.  A head CT on admission ruled 
out an intracranial bleed and his potassium was closely 
monitored.  In the emergency department they noted 15-20 beats 
of VTach and also a potassium of 2.7.  It was thought that his 
VTach was the cause of his syncopal episode and his hypokalemia 
was the cause of his VTach.  His potassium was repleted and he 
no longer experienced problems with pacing.  
.
# CHF: EF 20% -  patient came in appearing euvolemic or even 
slightly dry.  He was kept off his spironolactone, his lasix was 
initially held and his [**Last Name (un) 367**] and BB were continued.  His fluid 
status was monitored daily with serial exams and he had multiple 
chest xrays to monitor for fluid overload.  He subsequently 
became fluid overload which prompted a visit to the medical ICU. 
 While in the ICU, they tapped a pleural effusion on his left 
side which yielded 1.5L of transudative fluid.  They also gave 
him gentle diuresis with lasix 10 mg IV.  The patient 
subsequently became euvolemic and was transferred back to the 
floor.  A day later, he became hypovolemic with a free water 
deficit of 3L.  We replaced his fluid deficit appropriately but 
struggled with deteriorating respiratory status.  
.
# CRI: patient has had a baseline creatinine of 2.0 and had been 
increasing over the last month.  His creatinine on admission was 
2.5 and it climbed to 3.5 by the end of his stay.  We initially 
held his [**Last Name (un) 367**] and ACE inhibitor and involved renal in his care.  
It was thought that his renal impairment was secondary to both 
ATN from ischemic injury during his VTach but also from prerenal 
azotemia.  We balanced his fluid status with his CHF and 
attempted unsuccessfully to preserve his renal function.
.
# Nutrition: Patient had poor PO intake during the admission so 
an NGT was placed for tube feeds.  He tolerated the procedure 
well and was given low volume tube feeds with minimal flushing.  
Once his sodium began to rise, we increased the flushing volumes 
in an attempt to correct his volume status.  
.
# Odynophagia: The etiology behind this wasn't clear.  The 
patient developed throat pain in the middle of his admission.  
We sent multiple cultures and even had a biopsy performed of his 
posterior oropharynx.  The cultures only yielded MSSA and GNR 
which we treated with antibiotics.  We had suspected HSV, 
[**Female First Name (un) **], viral, bacterial and involved ID, GI, and ENT.  The 
pain was resolving when patient expired.
.
# Leukocytosis: present at admission without any fever or 
identifying source.  Initially thought to be secondary to 
inflammatory state.  However, the differential showed 88% PMNs.  
We began antibiotic treatment for coverage of the MSSA and GNR 
described above yet his leukocytosis persisted.  On the day of 
death, the patient had an even higher WBC.
.
# Coagulopathy: patient had been taking coumadin at home and his 
INR rose during the beginning of his admission.  Initially it 
was 2.7 but gradually it rose to 6.4.  We continued to hold his 
coumadin and encouraged patient to eat leafy vegetables.  We 
believe that the significant rise of his INR was secondary to 
the increasing dosages of amiodarone the patient had received.  
It had returned to below 1.5 prior to thoracentesis but again 
climbed prior to his death.
.
# Cardiovascular- Coronaries: We continued the patient on BB, 
statin, aspirin and monitored for any signs or sx of chest pain. 
 The patient had a workup for ACS upon arrival which was 
negative.
. 
###  Events leading up to death: Patient returned from the 
medical ICU and was doing well on 60% O2.  This was weaned over 
the next day and a half and the patient was oriented to person, 
place, situation, time.  However, the patient gradually became 
more disoriented and his mental status was waxing and waining.  
We had considered infectious, medications, hypoxia, renal 
failure, hypercarbia, and hypernatremia in our differential.  
The patient was weaned from O2 so we thought hypoxia unlikely.  
Additionally, we obtained a VBG which suggested he was not 
hypercarbic.  We broadened his abx coverage for anaerobes with 
flagyl as he had developed abdominal pain the day prior to 
death.  As he was clearly deteriorating, we had a family meeting 
the day prior to his death to discuss code status.  At that time 
the family decided to change his code to DNR/DNI with thoughts 
of CMO if he worsened.  That night, he became hypotensive to the 
60s systolic.  Aggressive fluid boluses were delivered (4 
liters) without much improvement.  The family was called and 
were present as the patient was undergoing fluid resuscitation.  
After attempts were seemingly unsuccessful, they decided to stop 
providing fluid and the patient expired shortly thereafter.  No 
autopsy was requested.

80 year old male admitted to MICU from [**Hospital Ward Name 3**] 3 with resp distress.

Allergies: NKDA

Past medical Hx:  CAD S/P CAGB and IMI, cath in '[**20**] with 3VD, 2+ MR, mod systolic and diastolic dysfunction; esopheageal stricture x2,; increased cholesterol; colonic polyps; AAA S/P repair at [**Hospital1 275**] '[**31**]; HTN; Pacer and ICD placement; ischemic CMY ('[**33**] EF 20%); gout; chronic renal insufficiency.

Review of systems-  Resp:  Received on 100% face mask.  Changed to 100% cool face tent.  O2 sats difficulty to obtain due to his tremors of the fingers, have readings of 96-97% initially but have decreased to 92%.  He was tapped for 1.5cc straw colored fluid from the left side.  He has a very junky cough but it is non productive.  CXR suggests that volume overload is the primary problem.  He was placed on BiPAP for 1hour following arrival to the MICU, he showed some improvement but he could not tolerate the mask.  Pt will be intubated by his wishes if the need comes up.

Cardiac:  B/P's 120's/60-70, HR 70 Vpaced.

GI:  Pt has a dubhoff tube in place.  He had been getting tube feedings on the floor but he is NPO due to the possibility of intubation.  His abd is soft and non tender, hypoactive bowel sounds.

GU:  Foley draining yellow urine.

Neuro:  Pt is awake and alert.  He has a very dry mouth so it is difficulty to understand but he is oriented.  However when left alone he does pick at the bedding.  He is getting very restless.  

Social:  Pt is married, [**State **] [**Known patient lastname 5629**] with a grown son.  Both very involved with the patients care.  Pt is a full code by his own choice.  

Plan:  Monitor resp status overnight for possible intubation,  keep pt safe during the night, he may need restraints to keep the O2 mask in place when the sun goes down.
