Service: [**Doctor First Name **]
 
Allergies: 
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs
 
Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 603**] 
Chief Complaint:
pancreas mass
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Whipple procedure [**3418-8-26**]

 
History of Present Illness:
58-year-old gentleman was with an unusual appearing cystic mass 
in the head of his pancreas.  His story began 5 or 6 months ago 
with an atypical attack of lower abdominal pain that was 
suprapubic in nature.  This led to
imaging at another hospital which revealed a cystic lesion in 
the head of the pancreas that was not simple in its morphology.  
Currently, he has a largish mass in the lower aspect of the head 
of the pancreas, an uncinate process which
has a thick wall septation and papillary projections. 
Furthermore, it is intimately adherent to the superior 
mesenteric vein.  All these features are worrisome for 
amalignant degeneration of a cystic neoplastic process.  He had 
no associated n/v, weight loss, pruritus, jaundice or 
steatorrhea.
 
Past Medical History:
1. Status post Whipple for pancreatic head mass 
2. Diabetes mellitus since [**3406**], insulin requiring 
3. Hypertension 
4. Coronary artery disease status post MI in [**3409**], status post 
stent. Stress test [**8-13**] with small territory of partially 
reversible inferior defect consistent with ischemia on nuclear 
imaging with no associated angina or EKG changes. 
5. Circumcision 2000 

 
Social History:
30 pack year h/o smoking.  no etoh or drug use currently but 
heavy etoh in the past.  currently in sales at department store.
 
Family History:
His family history is not significant for pancreatic cancer, 
colorectal cancer, melanoma, pancreatitis, gallstones, 
polyposis, 
or other cancers. There is a family history of a brother and a 
sister who each have diabetes and increased blood pressure. 

 
Physical Exam:
preoperatively, afebrile with stable vital signs.  neck supple 
without lymphadenopathy.  heart regular rate and rhythm without 
murmur.  lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.  abdomen soft, 
nontender, no mass and no scars.  no axillary or groin 
lymphadenopathy.  extremities without edema.  
 
Pertinent Results:
I.  Gallbladder (A):
No diagnostic abnormalities recognized.

II. Pylorus-sparing Whipple resection of the proximal pancreas 
(B-O):
1.  Head of the pancreas:
Area of chronic pancreatitis with mild activity and formation of 
a cystic cavity containing necrotic debris and bacteria.
a)  Extensive fibrosis.
b)  No neoplasm identified.

2.  Pancreatic and common bile duct resection margins:
No diagnostic abnormalities recognized.

3.  Duodenum:
No diagnostic abnormalities recognized.

4.  Three lymph[**MD Number 65**]:
No diagnostic abnormalities recognized.

5.  Separate segment of small intestine:
o diagnostic abnormalities recognized.

CT head [**3418-8-29**]:
Findings consistent with brain edema. Please refer to the 
nuclear medicine brain scan which failed to demonstrate blood 
flow to the brain and is consistent with brain death.

Brain Scan [**3418-8-29**]:
The study is consistent with brain death

EEG [**3418-8-29**]:
This is a markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the 
presence of a very low-voltage, slow background rhythm that was 
present 
throughout the recording. This finding suggests the presence of 
a 
severe encephalopathy. Cortical activity, though abnormal, was 
seen at 
all times. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Presented to west campus as same day admit.  Underwent pylorus 
preserving whipple procedure [**8-26**].  Refer to operative report 
for details. Did not require transfusions intraoperatively and 
blood loss estimated at 800cc. Remained intubated in recovery 
room postoperatively overnight due to length of procedure.  Labs 
drawn per whipple clinical pathway postoperatively and am of POD 
1 34.9 and 34.7 respectively.  Extubated morning of POD 1 
without difficulty.  Transferred to floor late afternoon of 
postoperative day 2.  Pain controlled via MSO4 PCA initially.  
Supplemented by two doses of Toradol.  Patient's heart rate 
difficult to control with high doses of beta blockers 
intraoperatively.  Was placed on lopressor 10 mg IV q 4hrs 
postoperatively.  Heart rate remained 90's to 100's sinus 
rhythm.  Postop EKG unchanged from previous.  Postop CXR showed 
RIJ line in good position without evidence of pneumothorax.  
Small right pleural effusion seen.  Patient was encouraged to 
use an incentive spirometer post extubation POD 1.  Patient was 
kept NPO with NGT to medium continuous suction POD 1.  Patient 
had made adequate urine POD 0 and 1.  Blood sugar difficult to 
control POD 1 and [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes center consult requested.  
 
His first postoperative day was uneventful. However, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 11166**] 
suffered an aspiration event early on the morning of 
postoperative day two. Around 8am on [**8-28**], coded on the floor 
during am rounds. Found by team to have agonal respirations. 
There was question of aspiration event as NGT clotted with 
blood. A code event was called and we were able to revive him 
initially from asystole. Code consisted of asystole and 
pulseless electrical activity. Code was noted to be ""prolonged"", 
 it was 3-5 minutes. However, had hypotension to 40s systolic 
even after restoration of pulse. Found to have large blood clots 
in trachea and from ETT s/p intubation, causing him to be 
initially difficult to ventilate. Bilateral needle decompression 
and chest tube placement to rule out pneumothorax. After 
suctioning of ETT clots, ventilation improved. Transferred to 
SICU.  Dropped hematocrit from 34.7 to 12.9. Was noted to cough, 
gag and move extremities spontaneously for several hours after 
code. He intially overbreathed the vent. However, the patient 
became non- verbal and unresponsive overnight and the patient no 
longer had a corneal reflex, gag, or cough, pupils fixed and 
dilated. No longer overbreathing vent.  After consultation of 
neurology and performing diagnostic studies, unfortunately, it 
became very clear that he suffered an anoxic brain injury. After 
declaration of brain death by our intensive care physicians, we 
met with the family to discuss this. They elected to withdrawal 
support at that point and Mr. [**Known patient lastname 11166**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5375**] on [**3418-8-31**].

     CHEST:
     
     INDICATION: S/P cardiac arrest. New ETT and bilateral chest tubes. Check
     position of Swan catheter.
     
     FINDINGS: A single AP semi-upright or possibly supine image is provided.
     Comparison study is taken 4 hours earlier. The positions of the ETT, the right
     IJ central line and the NG line remain satisfactory. Bilateral chest tubes are
     noted in the mid zones, probably in satisfactory positions. The right chest
     tube is somewhat tortuous in its distal orientation. The heart is not
     significantly enlarged. However, there is evidence of significantly increasing
     bilateral pulmonary infiltrates involving the right lung in all 3 zones and
     the left lung in the perihilar region. This is suggestive of pulmonary edema
     or possible aspiration pneumonitis. Further follow up images are recommended
     to assess the progression of these infiltrates.
     
     IMPRESSION: Worsening bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Satisfactory placement
     of lines and chest tubes. A line is also noted in the right upper quadrant of
     the abdomen, its exact position is uncertain.

     CHEST (PORTABLE AP)                                             Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 4865**]
     Reason: SOB poor oxygenation                                        
     Admitting Diagnosis: PANCREATIC MASS/SDA
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
          58 year old man with s/p PEA ARREST, NEW ETT AND BILATERAL CHEST TUBES.     
           
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      SOB poor oxygenation                                                            
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
     
     PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST:  Comparison is made to prior study dated [**3418-8-28**].  The
     ET tube, nasogastric tube, and right internal jugular central line remain in
     satisfactory position.  The Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed, and there is
     a left subclavian central line with its tip in the SVC. Right and left chest
     tubes remain in place.
     
     Midline structures are grossly unchanged.
     
     There is, however, marked interval worsening of the aeration with diffuse
     bilateral airspace infiltrates, and sparing of the left upper chest. The
     findings are most suggestive of pulmonary edema, although other etiologies
     cannot be excluded.  There is likely an associated left effusion.
     
     IMPRESSION: Tubes and catheter in satisfactory position as described.
     
     Significant interval worsening of aeration, suggesting pulmonary edema.

Dropping SA02 requires increase in peep to 15 cm to maintain 88% via pulse oximerty. Attempt at inversing I:E ratio rersulting in continued decreasing SA02. Return to I:E of 1:2. Increased peep also resulting in decrease in Vt from 525cc to 400cc, increased inspiratory pressure to 48 to maintain Vt of 500-525cc.
