                                     FINAL REPORT
     CT CHEST, [**2828-9-19**]:
     
     INDICATION:  COPD.  Steroid use.  Chills and sweats.
     
     Multidetector CT of the chest was performed without intravenous or oral
     contrast.  Images are presented for display in the axial plane at 5 mm and
     1.25 mm collimation.  The examination is technically limited due to submaximal
     inspiratory level and respiratory motion.
     
     Diffuse centrilobular branching opacities are present, consistent with
     extensive bronchiolitis.  This involves all lobes of both lungs, but is most
     marked in the right middle and both lower lobes.  More confluent consolidation
     is present posteriorly in the left lower lobe with adjacent ground-glass
     attenuation.  Dependent ground-glass opacity is also present in the right
     lower lobe.  Mild centrilobular and paraseptal emphysema is present with upper
     lobe predominance.  There has been prior wedge resection procedure in the
     right upper lung with adjacent scarring and mild volume loss.  Focal lateral
     herniation of the lung is present at the thoracotomy site.
     
     The patient inadvertently breathed during the image acquisition, and note is
     made of marked posterior bowing of the tracheal wall during images
     inadvertently obtained during expiratory phase of respiration.  There is also
     expiratory narrowing of the right upper lobe bronchus and bronchus intermedius
     and to a lesser degree the left main bronchus.
     
     Numerous small, subcentimeter mediastinal lymph nodes are present, which do
     not individually meet size criteria for abnormal enlargement.  Heart size is
     normal.  Diffuse coronary artery calcifications are present.  No pericardial
     or pleural effusion is seen.  A small hiatal hernia is noted.
     
     In the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, the adrenal glands are normal.
     Several small cystic lesions are present in both kidneys, and at least two
     low-attenuation lesions are seen within the liver, one at the dome measuring 9
     mm (image 45, series 5) and a second in the right lobe anteriorly measuring 8
     mm (image 54, series 5).  Dependent gallstones are present within the
     gallbladder.  Diffuse vascular calcifications are present extending into the
     renal arteries bilaterally.
     
     Bilateral gynecomastia is present.
     
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     (Cont)
     There has been previous right thoracotomy.  Degenerative changes are present
     within the spine.
     
     A lipoma is present laterally in the upper abdominal wall.
     
     Coronal reformation images also demonstrate a compression deformity in the
     lower thoracic spine at approximately T10.
     
     IMPRESSION:  
     1.  Dependent lower lobe consolidation and ground-glass attenuation
     accompanied by multilobar, diffuse bronchiolitis (tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 3927**] pattern),
     consistent with diffuse infectious process.  In the setting of hiatal hernia,
     aspiration pneumonia is also possible.
     
     2. Tracheobronchomalacia difficult to quantify due to lack of standardized
     breathing instructions.  If warranted clinically, once the patient's acute
     infection has resolved, dedicated CT trachea could be obtained to better
     assess this finding.
     
     3.  Emphysema.
     
     4.  Increased number of mediastinal lymph nodes, likely hyperplastic in the
     setting of acute infection.  These could also be reassessed at the time of
     followup CT.
     
     5.  Diffuse coronary artery calcifications.
     
     6.  Small cystic lesions in the liver and kidneys, incompletely characterized.
     These could be more fully characterized by ultrasound if warranted clinically.

     INDICATIONS:  74-year-old man with pneumonia and congestive heart failure.
     
     CHEST, PORTABLE AP VIEW:  No comparisons are available.  The heart size is
     likely normal.  There is mild bilateral distention of the pulmonary vessels
     and peribronchial cuffing, most consistent with congestive heart failure.
     There is no definite evidence of pneumonia, although PA and lateral views
     would be more sensitive for detection of subtle consolidation. There are no
     pleural effusions or pneumothorax, although the far right costophrenic sulcus
     is excluded.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Findings most consistent with mild congestive heart failure.

     HISTORY:  Check placement OG tube.  Evaluate for pleural effusions and edema.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous study from [**2828-11-16**].
     
     The endotracheal tube is unchanged.  There is a left-sided IJ catheter
     with distal lead tip in the left brachiocephalic vein which is unchanged.
     Nasogastric tube has been placed however due to poor technique, the sideport
     is not well seen.  The distal tip is in the fundus of the stomach and the
     sideport is likely at the GE junction and could be advanced several
     centimeters for more optimal placement.  There are low lung volumes which
     limits evaluation.  There is unchanged cardiomegaly.  There is a left
     retrocardiac opacity which is better evaluated on the prior chest CT.  Overall
     the findings are stable since the radiograph from seven hours earlier.

     INDICATION: Placement.
     
     Portable single view of the chest was compared to [**2828-9-19**], and
     demonstrates ETT terminating in the mid thoracic trachea and left IJ catheter
     tip terminating at the brachiocephalic SVC junction.  The lung volumes are low
     with bibasilar atelectasis, and diffuse increased opacification of the left
     hemithorax may represent evolving diffuse infectious process as suggested by
     chest CT [**2828-9-19**].  Alternatively, this may represent asymmetric pulmonary
     edema or layering effusion.  Small nodular opacities in the right lung are
     also new and may represent infectious process.  Cardiomegaly and mediastinal
     contours are stable allowing for lower lung volumes.  Note is made of a T10
     compression deformity, stable from [**2828-9-19**].
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  ETT and left IJ central venous catheter as described above.
     2.  Low lung volumes and diffuse increased opacification of left lung may
     represent infectious process, asymmetric pulmonary edema, or layering
     effusion.  New nodular opacities in the right lung may also represent
     infectious process.
     3.  Stable T10 compression deformity.

     Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2829-3-23**].
     
     The heart size is moderately enlarged but stable.  There is no evidence of
     congestive heart failure.  Bibasal linear opacities are unchanged, most likely
     representing atelectasis.  No sizable pleural effusion is noted.  The overall
     lung volumes remain low.

     HISTORY:  COPD, CHF, look for vascular congestion.
     
     IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to [**3-23**] and 9:
     
     Vascular congestion and cardiomegaly are borderline unchanged since [**3-23**].  There is no pleural effusion.  Lung volumes remain low, particular on the
     right where there is relative elevation of the lung base, with disparity more
     pronounced now than it was in July, probably due to progressive diaphragmatic
     eventration.

     Preop.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2829-3-26**].
     
     AP AND LATERAL CHEST:  Lung volumes remain low as on prior study, with
     elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
     unchanged.  There again noted is bilateral lower lobe atelectasis,
     particularly in the retrocardiac region.  Posterior blunting of the
     costophrenic angles is likely.  No definite pulmonary vascular congestion is
     appreciated.  The osseous structures redemonstrate compression deformities in
     the thoracolumbar region.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis with probable small bilateral
     pleural effusions in the absence of overt congestive heart failure.  Stable
     thoracolumbar compression deformity.

     HISTORY:  Post laminectomy and fusion, evaluate hardware.
     
     C-SPINE, TWO VIEWS. No preoperative films are on PACS record for comparison.
     
     On the lateral view, C1 through mid C6 vertebral body is demonstrated. Pedicle
     screws and rods are present.  Precise positioning of the screws is somewhat
     difficult to assess on this film due to obliquity of the beam. Overall,
     positioning is nominal.  There is minimal anterolisthesis of C3 on C4 and
     grade 1 anterolisthesis of C4 on C5 with disc space narrowing at the C3
     through 6 levels.  Multiple tubes and lines overlie the C-spine.  Skin staples
     are present.

     HISTORY:  CVL, ET tube placement.
     
     CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
     
     Lordotic positioning.
     
     An ET tube is present, tip in satisfactory position approximately 6.1 cm above
     the carina.  An NG tube is present, tip beneath diaphragm extending off the
     film.  A right IJ central line is present, tip overlying the proximal SVC.
     LAt the periphery of these films, fixation devices in the cervical spine and
     overlying skin staples and fixation hardware in the lower lumbar spine is
     noted.
     
     There is probable moderately-severe cardiomegaly, with unfolded aorta. There
     are right greater than left effusions and underlying collapse and/or
     consolidation.  The diaphragms are obscured and therefore diaphragmatic level
     cannot be confidently determined.  There is upper zone redistribution and mild
     diffuse vascular blurring, suggesting mild CHF.
     
     Compared with [**2829-8-26**], the left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation is
     significantly worse as is the xxx effusion.  A small xx effusion is new. There
     is slight increase in the degree of atelectasis at the right base. Pulmonary
     vasculature is probably unchanged.  I suspect some background parenchymal
     scarring.

     TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
     
     INDICATION:  Pneumonia on admission and COPD.  Assess for resolution.
     
     FINDINGS:  AP single view obtained with patient in supine position is analyzed
     in direct comparison with a preceding supine examination of [**2829-8-27**]. 
     During the interval, the patient has been extubated.  Row of subcutaneous
     surgical staples is seen in midline of the neck.  The previously described
     right internal jugular approach central venous line remains in unchanged
     position.  No pneumothorax is identified.  As before, heart size cannot be
     determined because of basal densities on this portable chest examination.  In
     comparison with the preceding examination, no new parenchymal infiltrates are
     present and pulmonary vasculature shows less perivascular haze.  The right
     diaphragm is again elevated with mild blunting of the right lateral pleural
     sinus.  The left side has cleared up somewhat, still some local densities
     representing either atelectasis or remaining infiltrates are seen in
     retrocardiac position.  Improvement of previously described congestive pattern
     and bilateral basal densities.  Further followup is recommended.
