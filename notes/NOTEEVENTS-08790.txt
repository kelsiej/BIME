     assess for hydronephrosis or obstruction.
     
     COMPARISON:  Renal ultrasound of [**2705-5-31**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The right kidney measures 10 cm.  The left kidney measures 9.3 cm.
     Both kidneys are somewhat atrophic, with thin cortex, and are more echogenic
     than normal.  These findings are seen in chronic renal disease.  Again seen in
     the medial aspect of the right kidney is a 3 cm anechoic simple renal cyst.
     Again seen is an approximately 2.5 cm anechoic, exophytic simple renal cyst in
     the lateral aspect of the left kidney.  A 3 mm [**Doctor First Name 10602**] is seen in the
     corticomedullary junction of the mid-sagittal right kidney.  There are no
     frank kidney stones seen in either kidney.  The bladder is seen collapsed
     around a Foley catheter.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Cortical thinning, atrophy, increased echogenicity of both kidneys
     indicating chronic renal disease.
     2.  Bilateral simple renal cysts, essentially unchanged from prior
     examination.
     3.  A 3 mm [**Doctor First Name 10602**], but no frank stones, seen in the right kidney.
     4.  There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or obstruction to explain the
     patient's acute renal failure.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS: [**Age over 90 **] y/o male with aortic valve replacement, prostate cancer, acute
     renal failure and chronic insufficiency with necrotic toe.  Left lower
     extremity ulcer.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1129**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 6**].  Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 6**], the attending radiologist was present and supervising.  Signed and
     informed consent was obtained from the patient.
     
     The patient was placed supine on the angiography table. The left groin was
     prepped and draped in a standard sterile fashion.  The skin and subcutaneous
     tissue was anesthestized with approximately 5 cc of 1% lidocaine. With the
     assistance of fluoroscopy and ultrasound, the left common femoral artery was
     accessed using an 18 gauge micropuncture needle. A .035 [**Location (un) 935**] wire was then
     advanced through the access needle into the abdominal aorta under direct
     fluoroscopic guidance. The skin entry site was then incised with 11 blade
     scalpel. The access needle was exchanged for a 4 French Omniflush catheter
     which was then advanced over the [**Location (un) 935**] wire into the abdominal aorta. The
     [**Location (un) 935**] wire was removed. The omniflush catheter was then positioned in the
     abdominal aorta at the level of the L1 vertebral body.  The catheter was then
     connected to a power contrast injector and an aortogram was performed.  The
     Omniflush catheter was then disconnected from the power contrast injector and
     connected to a pressure monitoring system.  Pressures were then obtained in
     the abdominal aorta, left common femoral and left superficial femoral artery.
     The catheter was then again reconnected to the power contrast injector and
     withdrawn to the level of the L4 vertebral body.  Sequential angiograms were
     then obtained of the pelvic vessels and a run off of the left lower extremity.
     The catheter was then removed and hemostasis was achieved after 15 minutes of
     direct compression.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is diffuse, mild disease of the aorta without significant
     stenosis.  No pressure gradients are identified from the aorta to the left
     external iliac artery. The common femoral artery is unremarkable. The profunda
     shows mild disease. The superficial femoral artery shows mild diffuse disease.
     The popliteal also shows mild, diffuse disease. There is diffuse disease at
     the trifurcation with occlusion of the posterior tibial proximally. There is a
     small anterior tibial and a patent peroneal. The peroneal reconstitutes the

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS: [**Age over 90 **] y/o male with aortic valve replacement, prostate cancer, acute
     renal failure and chronic insufficiency with necrotic toe.  Left lower
     extremity ulcer.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1129**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 6**].  Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 6**], the attending radiologist was present and supervising.  Signed and
     informed consent was obtained from the patient.
     
     The patient was placed supine on the angiography table. The left groin was
     prepped and draped in a standard sterile fashion.  The skin and subcutaneous
     tissue was anesthestized with approximately 5 cc of 1% lidocaine. With the
     assistance of fluoroscopy and ultrasound, the left common femoral artery was
     accessed using an 18 gauge micropuncture needle. A .035 [**Location (un) 935**] wire was then
     advanced through the access needle into the abdominal aorta under direct
     fluoroscopic guidance. The skin entry site was then incised with 11 blade
     scalpel. The access needle was exchanged for a 4 French Omniflush catheter
     which was then advanced over the [**Location (un) 935**] wire into the abdominal aorta. The
     [**Location (un) 935**] wire was removed. The omniflush catheter was then positioned in the
     abdominal aorta at the level of the L1 vertebral body.  The catheter was then
     connected to a power contrast injector and an aortogram was performed.  The
     Omniflush catheter was then disconnected from the power contrast injector and
     connected to a pressure monitoring system.  Pressures were then obtained in
     the abdominal aorta, left common femoral and left superficial femoral artery.
     The catheter was then again reconnected to the power contrast injector and
     withdrawn to the level of the L4 vertebral body.  Sequential angiograms were
     then obtained of the pelvic vessels and a run off of the left lower extremity.
     The catheter was then removed and hemostasis was achieved after 15 minutes of
     direct compression.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is diffuse, mild disease of the aorta without significant
     stenosis.  No pressure gradients are identified from the aorta to the left
     external iliac artery. The common femoral artery is unremarkable. The profunda
     shows mild disease. The superficial femoral artery shows mild diffuse disease.
     The popliteal also shows mild, diffuse disease. There is diffuse disease at
     the trifurcation with occlusion of the posterior tibial proximally. There is a
     small anterior tibial and a patent peroneal. The peroneal reconstitutes the
                                                                 (Over)

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief hospital course, by issue:

1.  Sepsis/fungemia

In the MICU, the patient was placed on broad spectrum sepsis 
coverage
with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and flagyl.  He was also started 
on
pressors.  Blood cultures subsequently grew out budding yeast 
that was
further confirmed to be [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.  The patient was 
originally
placed on ambisone and was subsequently switched to fluconazole. 
 The
Flagyl was discontinued secondary to negative anerobic cultures. 
 The
patient's toe cultures subsequently grew out resistant proteus 
and
MSSA.

The patient was weaned from pressors on [**2707-9-14**] and a left
transmetatarsal amputation was performed on [**2707-9-16**] to remove 
the
gangrenous source of his infection. The patient was extubated on 
[**9-17**]
without difficulty.

Of note, the TTE performed on [**9-16**] demonstrated echogenicity on 
the
right atrial pacer wire that was consistent with either thrombus 
or
vegetation.  ID was consulted, and they felt that the optimal
treatment is to remove the pacer. However, EP predicts 10 to 15
percent mortality from such procedure.  The patient is therefore
instead be committed to medical therapy per ID.

In addition, hemodialysis was initiated on [**9-13**], and a 
hemodialysis
catheter was placed on [**2707-9-18**].  The patient was subsequently
transferred to the floor on an antibiotic regimen of oxacillin,
ceftriaxone, and fluconazole.  Blood cultures from [**9-13**] were 
returned as negative, so the patient's ceftriaxone and oxacillin 
were stopped on [**9-20**].

2.  GI bleed
On [**9-21**], the patient had multiple episodes of melena and 
vomiting of bright red blood.  He was found to have a 
supertherapeutic PTT level (>100) so his heparin was stopped and 
he was transferred to the MICU to be stabilized.  Following a 
brief course in the MICU the patient returned to the floor on 
[**9-23**].

A subsequent upper endoscopy revealed signs of gastritis and 
duodenal inflammation, but no focal ulcers.  The patient was 
restarted on coumadin to begin anticoagulation for treatment of 
AF on [**9-24**].

3.  Infectious disease
A UCx from [**9-19**] grew [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] the patient was started on 
linezolid treatment.  Two subsequent urine cultures had no 
growth, so linezolid was stopped.  The patient also had signs of 
erythema and possible infection around the site of his 
amputation on his foot.  As such, he was started on a 14 day 
course of Zosyn beginning on [**9-23**].  The patient has negative 
blood cultures, but the decision has been made to continue him 
on lifelong fluconazole treatment for candidemia, as his 
pacemaker with the vegetation on it cannot be removed.  A PICC 
line was placed on [**2707-9-26**] for long term antibiotic treatment.

Medical issues upon discharge:

#1: ID: The patient was found to have [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans via blood 
cultures, and has been started on flucanazole.  Based on the 
negative margins on his amputated foot, his oxacillin and 
ceftriaxone were discontinued.  He had a subsequent increase in 
his WBC that was most likely caused by a UTI that was cultured 
to grow VRE.  He was subsequently treated with linezolid, and a 
f/u UCx from [**9-23**] was negative for bacterial growth, and the 
linezolid was d/c on [**9-27**].  The patient was also started on IV 
Zosyn on 10/15 per vascular's recommendation secondary to 
infection of his wound site.  He had a PICC line placed on [**9-26**] 
for IV access, and will be d/c on IV Zosyn and fluconazole.

#2: Renal Faliure:  The patient had a temporary femoral dialysis 
catheter placed.  Renal followed him throughout his stay and 
manged his hemodialysis.  A tunnel catheter for dialysis was 
placed on [**9-23**].  His PhoLo was d/c because the patient could 
not swallow the pills.  He received HD on the day of discharge 
and is scheduled for subseqent HD as an outpatient on [**10-1**].

#3: Coagulopathy/anemia:  The patient had several episodes of 
bleeding that led to multiple transfusions and treatment with 
EPO along with his dialysis. He is currently on coumadin for 
anticogulation and will be monitored via INR, with goal of 2-3. 

#4: Mitral regurgitation:  Patient was started on Metoprolol 
25mg BID and captopril 6.25mg TID to decrease afterload 
pressures on the heart and reduce regurgitation. 

#5: PVD:  S/p left metatarsal amputation on [**9-16**].  Path results 
demonstrate complete resection of infected material.  Wound 
appears slightly infected but improving, will finish 10 day IV 
Zosyn therapy per vascular rec.

#6: AF: Will continue anticoagulation as described above. 

#7: FEN:  Patient assessed by speech and swallow and determined 
that he could begin a thin liquid/puree���d solids diet, and we 
started oral feeds and medicines without incident. 

#8: Mental status:  Throughout the course of his stay on the 
floor, the patient had notable improvements in his mental 
status. He has baseline dementia and short term memory loss, but 
the somulence and disorientation that were first apparent have 
largely resolved, and the patient is close to baseline according 
to his son. In the two days prior to discharge, the patient 
began to exhibit increased agitation and mild delirium that was 
most likely secondary to sundowning complicated by underlying 
dementia and infection. 

Problem #9: Visual Changes:  Patient reports seeing bugs 
crawling on surfaces.  We are not sure if these are actual bugs 
or secondary to visual pathology. Ophthalmology has been 
consulted and ruled out fungal uveitis on [**9-16**] visit.  
Hallucinations did not persist and were not followed further per 
optho rec.

     its tip terminating in the distal SVC.  No pneumothorax is identified on the
     supine radiograph.  An NG tube has also been placed whose tip is off the edge
     of the film, but likely within the distal stomach or proximal duodenum.  CHF
     is unchanged from one hour prior.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory position of left IJ central venous catheter.  No
     pneumothorax.

     PORTABLE CHEST: There are no prior studies for comparison. The tip of the NG
     tube projects over the right midabdomen medially, and is presumably in the
     antrum or duodenal bulb. There are very extensive vascular calcifications,
     particularly in the pelvis. There is a paucity of bowel gas overall, with
     small amount of air in what is probably large bowel. No dilated large or small
     bowel loops are identified. Note that the margins of normal structures of the
     abdomen are not well delineated, of uncertain significance. Free air cannot be
     excluded on a single supine film.

      grounds.                       
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      interval change in UGI bleed, coffee grounds                                    
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Status-post NG tube placement for GI bleed.
     
     PORTABLE CHEST:  A single AP view of the chest was compared to a prior
     examination dated [**2707-9-19**].
     
     The exam is limited due to technique.  The lung apices and left lateral thorax
     are not included.  The patient is status-post median sterotomy.  A single lead
     cardiac pacemaker pacer is visualized.  Its tip is difficult to visualize on
     this examination, but likely overlys the region of the right ventricle.  There
     is a nasogastric tube with its tip in the stomach.  A right-sided central
     venous catheter is present with its tip at the junction of the SVC and right
     atrium. Small bilateral effusions are suspected.  No definite focal
     consolidations are appreciated on this examination.
     
     IMPRESSION
     
     1.  Limited examination.
     2.  The nasogastric tube appears in place.
     
     A PA and lateral view of the chest is recommended for further evaluation for
     pulmonary pathology.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Internal jugular tunneled dialysis catheter for hemodialysis                    
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old man with end-stage renal disease.  Patient was
     referred for a tunneled dialysis catheter.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  This procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 4385**] [**Name (STitle) 42**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 58**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 59**] and supervised by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1560**] [**Name (STitle) 389**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 389**], the Attending
     Radiologist, was present throughout the procedure.
     
     CONSENT:  After giving explanations of the benefits and risks of the
     procedure, informed consent was obtained over the phone from the patient's
     health proxy, his son [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 10616**] [**Known patient lastname 10617**].
     
     PROCEDURE:  The patient was placed supine on the angiography table.  He
     presented with a right-sided right IJ central venous line.  His neck and upper
     chest were prepared in standard sterile fashion.  In order to use the right-
     sided access for placement of the tunneled dialysis line, we initially went to
     the left side to place a central venous line to make sure the patient has
     access for medications.  Ultrasound was used to localize the left internal
     jugular vein which presented patent and compressible.  Under ultrasonographic
     guidance, the left internal jugular vein was accessed with a 21-gauge needle.
     No hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained.  A 0.018 guide wire was
     advanced through the needle into the superior vena cava under fluoroscopic
     guidance.  The needle was removed over the wire and replaced by a 4.5-French
     micropuncture sheath.  The wire was removed and replaced with a 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name **]
     wire which was directed into the inferior vena cava.  The micropuncture sheath
     was removed and the tract was dilated with a 6-French dilator.  A 7-French
     triple-lumen central venous line was advanced over the wire into the superior
     vena cava.  A final chest x-ray was obtained showing the tip to be located
     into the right atrium.  The line was flushed and secured to the skin and a
     dressing was applied.  Then we proceeded to the right side.  Local anesthesia
     with 10 ml of 1% lidocaine was given to the anterior chest wall and to the
     right neck at the entry site of the indwelling central venous line.  The
     tunnel tract was burrowed under the skin with a blunt needle.  A 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name **]
     wire was advanced through the central venous line into the superior vena cava.
      The central line was removed over the wire and the tract was dilated with 12-
     and 14-French dilators.  A 15-French peel-away sheath was inserted into the
     superior vena cava and the tip of the tunneled line was advanced through the
     peel-away sheath into the superior vena cava.  A final chest x-ray was
     obtained and it demonstrated adequate position of the right-sided dialysis
                                                                 (Over)

     COMPARISON:  [**2707-9-16**] and [**2707-9-21**]
     
     FINDINGS: An AP semi-upright chest radiograph demonstrates persistent
     bilateral pleural effusions, interstitial opacities and cardiomegaly
     consistent with persistent congestive heart failure.  There is also left
     retrocardiac opacity and this could represent atelectasis however a developing
     pneumonia cannot be excluded.  The nasogastric tube has been removed.  The
     central venous line entering from the left has its tip in the SVC/right atrial
     junction as does the right dialysis catheter.  The single lead pacer is
     unchanged.  There are some calcications in the left upper quadrant.  These may
     be due to a calcified splenic artery vs. pancreatic calcifications.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Persistent heart failure with effusions and pulmonary edema.
     2)  Left retrocardiac density; while this may represent atelectasis an
     underlying pneumonia can't be excluded.

     triple-lumen central venous line was advanced over the wire into the superior
     vena cava.  A final chest x-ray was obtained showing the tip to be located
     into the right atrium.  The line was flushed and secured to the skin and a
     dressing was applied.  Then we proceeded to the right side.  Local anesthesia
     with 10 ml of 1% lidocaine was given to the anterior chest wall and to the
     right neck at the entry site of the indwelling central venous line.  The
     tunnel tract was burrowed under the skin with a blunt needle.  A 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name **]

     COMPARISON:  [**2707-9-16**] and [**2707-9-21**]
     
     FINDINGS: An AP semi-upright chest radiograph demonstrates persistent
     bilateral pleural effusions, interstitial opacities and cardiomegaly
     consistent with persistent congestive heart failure.  There is also left
     retrocardiac opacity and this could represent atelectasis however a developing
     pneumonia cannot be excluded.  The nasogastric tube has been removed.  The
     central venous line entering from the left has its tip in the SVC/right atrial
     junction as does the right dialysis catheter.  The single lead pacer is
     unchanged.  There are some calcications in the left upper quadrant.  These may
     be due to a calcified splenic artery vs. pancreatic calcifications.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Persistent heart failure with effusions and pulmonary edema.
     2)  Left retrocardiac density; while this may represent atelectasis an
     underlying pneumonia can't be excluded.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old man with end-stage renal disease.  Patient was
     referred for a tunneled dialysis catheter.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  This procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 4385**] [**Name (STitle) 42**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 58**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 59**] and supervised by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1560**] [**Name (STitle) 389**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 389**], the Attending
     Radiologist, was present throughout the procedure.
     
     CONSENT:  After giving explanations of the benefits and risks of the
     procedure, informed consent was obtained over the phone from the patient's
     health proxy, his son [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 10616**] [**Known patient lastname 10617**].
     
     PROCEDURE:  The patient was placed supine on the angiography table.  He
     presented with a right-sided right IJ central venous line.  His neck and upper
     chest were prepared in standard sterile fashion.  In order to use the right-
     sided access for placement of the tunneled dialysis line, we initially went to
     the left side to place a central venous line to make sure the patient has
     access for medications.  Ultrasound was used to localize the left internal
     jugular vein which presented patent and compressible.  Under ultrasonographic
     guidance, the left internal jugular vein was accessed with a 21-gauge needle.
     No hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained.  A 0.018 guide wire was
     advanced through the needle into the superior vena cava under fluoroscopic
     guidance.  The needle was removed over the wire and replaced by a 4.5-French
     micropuncture sheath.  The wire was removed and replaced with a 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name **]
     wire which was directed into the inferior vena cava.  The micropuncture sheath
     was removed and the tract was dilated with a 6-French dilator.  A 7-French

     HISTORY:  Candidymia requiring long-term intravenous antibiotics.  Please
     place PICC line.  Intravenous therapy nursing was unable to advance a PICC
     line.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 58**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 59**], and [**Doctor First Name 4385**]
     [**Doctor Last Name 42**], and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1560**] [**Name (STitle) 389**],  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 389**], the Attending Radiologist, was
     present and supervising throughout the procedure.  The left upper arm was
     prepped in a sterile fashion.  Since no suitable superficial veins were
     visible, ultrasound was used for localization of a suitable vein.  The basilic
     vein was patent and compressible.  After local anesthesia with 2 mls of 1%
     Lidocaine, the basilic vein was entered under ultrasonographic guidance with a
     21-gauge needle.  No hardcopy of ultrasound images was obtained.  A 0.018
     guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopy into the superior vena cava.  Based
     on the markers on the guidewire it was determined that a length of 45 cm would
     be suitable.  The PICC line was trimmed to length and advanced over a 4-French
     introducer sheath under fluoroscopic guidance into the superior vena cava. The
     sheath was removed.  The catheter was flushed.  A final chest x-ray was
     obtained.  The film demonstrates the tip to be in the superior vena cava, just
     above the atrium.  A statlock was applied and the line was heplocked.  The
     line is ready for use.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 45 cm total length PICC line with tip
     in the superior vena cava, ready for use.

      [**Age over 90 **] year old man with candidemia, upper GI bleed needs access for long-term IV 
      antibiotics.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Please place line.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Candidymia requiring long-term intravenous antibiotics.  Please
     place PICC line.  Intravenous therapy nursing was unable to advance a PICC
     line.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 58**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 59**], and [**Doctor First Name 4385**]
     [**Doctor Last Name 42**], and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1560**] [**Name (STitle) 389**],  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 389**], the Attending Radiologist, was
     present and supervising throughout the procedure.  The left upper arm was
     prepped in a sterile fashion.  Since no suitable superficial veins were
     visible, ultrasound was used for localization of a suitable vein.  The basilic
     vein was patent and compressible.  After local anesthesia with 2 mls of 1%
     Lidocaine, the basilic vein was entered under ultrasonographic guidance with a
     21-gauge needle.  No hardcopy of ultrasound images was obtained.  A 0.018
     guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopy into the superior vena cava.  Based
     on the markers on the guidewire it was determined that a length of 45 cm would
     be suitable.  The PICC line was trimmed to length and advanced over a 4-French
     introducer sheath under fluoroscopic guidance into the superior vena cava. The
     sheath was removed.  The catheter was flushed.  A final chest x-ray was
     obtained.  The film demonstrates the tip to be in the superior vena cava, just
     above the atrium.  A statlock was applied and the line was heplocked.  The
     line is ready for use.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 45 cm total length PICC line with tip
     in the superior vena cava, ready for use.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Leukocytosis, shortness of breath.
     
     COMPARISON: [**2707-9-23**]
     
     CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: There are moderate pleural effusions bilaterally with
     reactive atelectasis at the bases.  No focal opacities are identified although
     consolidation cannot be excluded in the retrocardiac region.  There is mild
     increased interstitial opacity with upper zone redistribution consistent with
     mild left ventricular heart failure.  This appears improved when compared to
     previous study.  The right IJ dialysis catheter is in unchanged position with
     the tip in the right atrium.  There is a left sided PICC with tip in the
     superior vena cava.  The single left sided pacer is unchanged in position. The
     patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic valve replacement. The
     aorta is unfolded with wall calcifications.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with reactive atelectasis at the lung
     bases.  An underlying infiltrate cannot be excluded in the retrocardiac
     region.
     2.  Mild left ventricular heart failure which is improved when compared to the
     previous study.
