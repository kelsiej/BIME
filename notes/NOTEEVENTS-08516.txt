     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      49 year old woman with corrhosis.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  49-year-old female with cirrhosis, hepatitis C.  Please assess
     vessel patency, rule out focal lesions and ascites.
     
     FINDINGS:  The gallbladder does not contain any stones or sludge.  The
     gallbladder wall appears mildly thickened, but there is no distention of the
     gallbladder, and there is no pericholecystic fluid.  There is extensive
     ascites throughout the abdomen.  The liver exhibits a diffusely coarsened
     echotexture, consistent with known cirrhosis.  No focal lesions are seen
     within the liver.  The common duct is not dilated.  There is no evidence of
     intra - or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.  Again seen is patent
     umbilical vein consistent with history of portal hypertension and cirrhosis. 
     Also, seen are dilated venous structures in the region of the gallbladder,
     which may represent gallbladder varices.  Color Doppler examination of the
     hepatic vessels demonstrates patent right anterior, left, and main portal
     veins.  There is, however, some degree of [**Hospital1 **]-directionality of flow, which may
     represent worsening portal hypertension, and/or some degree of stasis within
     the portal venous system.  The hepatic veins are patent with appropriate
     directionality of flow.  The hepatic artery is patent, within a normal
     appearing waveform.  The pancreas is not visualized due to overlying bowel
     gas, and the aorta as well is not visualized due to overlying bowel gas.  The
     spleen measures 12 cm, and appears unremarkable.  There is a probable
     left-sided pleural effusion.  The right kidney measures 13.4 cm; the left
     kidney measures 11.8 cm.  Both kidneys are normal in appearance, without
     evidence of stones, mass, or hydronephrosis.  A significant amount of ascites
     is seen within the lower quadrants of the abdomen bilaterally.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Large volume of ascites.
     
     2.  Heterogeneous liver consistent with history of cirrhosis.  Patent
     umbilical vein and probable gallbladder varices consistent with known history
     of portal hypertension.
     
     3.  Probable left pleural effusion.
     
     4.  Patent hepatic vessels.  Bidirectional flow within the portal venous
     system may indicate worsening of portal hypertension.

Radiology:
==========
Abdominal ultrasound [**2901-8-12**]
IMPRESSION:
1) Nodular, cirrhotic liver with a large amount of ascites.
2) Patent hepatic vasculature; hepatofugal flow in the main 
portal vein.
3) Markedly distended gallbladder with mild wall thickening, 
which likely relates to coexisting liver disease. Negative 
sonographic [**Doctor Last Name **] sign.
.
Adominal MRI [**2901-8-17**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Cirrhotic liver, apparantly with moderate biliary dilatation 
involving the left-sided intrahepatic bile ducts, but without 
dilatation of the right bile ducts or the extrahepatic bile 
ducts. This is presumably secondary to hilar stricture, although 
further detail could not be obtained despite attempt to re-image 
the patient.
2. No discrete mass lesions are identified, although this is a 
technically and habitus-limited examination. 
3. There is a large amount of ascites, with moderate left 
pleural effusion and small right pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
49 yo F with a h/o cirrhosis [**12-30**] to hep C on the transplant list 
p/w with a 2 day h/o black stools c/w UGIB.  The patient's 
multiple medical problems will be described here individually 
for the sake of clarity.  
.  
On the 2nd and 3rd days of admission the patient was noted to 
have deteriorating mental status and severe asterixis consistent 
with hepatic encephlopathy. These symptoms resolved with 
titration of lactulose and several bowel movements.  
.  
The patient w/ baseline pulmonary hypertension, noted on [**2901-8-19**] 
to be hypoxic and tachycardic while in bed w/worsening while 
working with physical therapy. Pt continued to require 
supplemental oxygen throughout hospital stay [**12-30**] pleural 
effusion; mild improvement w/diuresis and therapeutic 
paracentesis, however she will require home oxygen. Plan for 
outpt cardiac cath to assess PA htn.   
.  
The patient's intial complaint of melena was never verified by 
witnessing a dark tarry stool in the hospital.  Though her HCT 
was low relative to her baseline of ~35, her HCT stayed stable 
while in the hospital around 28-30.  There was no obvious source 
of potential recent bleeding on the EGD performed on [**2901-8-15**]; 
continued PPI throughout hospital course.  
.  
The patient was noted to be hyponatremia on admission at 118.  
This corrected during her stay with discontinuation of 
furosemide and volume resucitation to a baseline of 128.  Based 
on BUN/CR there has been no renal failure during this admission. 
 Lasix was been restarted without a decline in the patient's Na. 
 
.  
The patient is not clear how she contracted hep C cirrhosis.  
She is on the transplant list with a MELD score on [**2901-8-21**] of 
28.  An ECHO was obtained to assess the pulmonary hypertension 
which would affect the suitability for surgery. The ECHO was 
unable to comment on PA pressures.  An MRI/MRA/MRCP was obtained 
to assess the gallbladder which was thought to be thickened 
based on an admission ultrasound.  The MR read did not comment 
on the gall bladder but rather reported on dilation of the left 
intrahepatic bile ducts.  This is concerning for CA in the bile 
ducts at the hilum.  An ERCP to obtain a tissue diagnosis 
[**2901-8-24**]. Continued nadolol/lasix/lactulose throughout hospital 
course. HepC+ cirrhosis- encephalopathic sx have resolved;pt on 
transplant list; transplant team aware of pt. Workup for 
transplant ongoing. Therapeutic/diagnostic paracentesis Cx ngtd, 
cytology pending. 
.
# biliary stricture- MRI/MRA/MRCP suggesting hepatic hilar left 
bile duct stricture;   ERCP [**2901-8-24**] showed single stricture at 
the hilum which they were able to stent. Stent to be changed in 
3 months to metallic stent, CA19-9 levels from [**2901-8-19**] 193 
concerning for malignancy (cholangio ca). CEA 12.
.
.
Pt was transferred to the MICU on [**2901-9-14**] for worsening 
hypoxemia and mental status changes due to decompensated CHF 
with pleural effusions and GI bleed.  Pt was treated for 
hypoxemia and covered with broad antibiotics for fever of 
unknown etiolgy; a DNR/DNI order was obtained at 12:00 on 
[**2901-9-14**] following detailed discussion with pt's HCP regarding 
end of life management.  Aggressive management was later 
deferred per HCP's wishes following further discussion with 
family, and subsequent efforts focused on providing full comfort 
measures, including morphine for pain and social work 
consultation for family coping.  Pt ultimately died and was 
pronounced by MD examination at 14:00 on [**2901-9-16**]; cause of 
death was cardio-pulmonary failure due to fulminant hepatic 
failure extending from decompensated Hep C Cirrhosis.  Pt's 
family was present for pt's death.

      49 year old with HepC cirrhosis. melena for 2 days and incidental finding of 
      enlarged gall bladder on CT scan.  This exam is part of pre-transplant workup. 
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Please assess biliary tree.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Hepatitis C cirrhosis, melena, enlarged gallbladder on CT scan.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MR imaging of the abdomen was obtained, including
     dynamically acquired images obtained before, during, and after the IV
     administration of gadolinium.  Breathhold-independent imaging was used for
     this examination.  No comparison MR examinations are available.
     
     FINDINGS:  The liver is markedly cirrhotic and nodular, with changes of
     associated fibrosis.  Although the examination is limited by body habitus and
     respiratory motion throughout the examination, no gross mass lesions are
     identified. There is moderate intrahepatic biliary dilatation involving the
     left lobe, presumably secondary to a stricture, as the right-sided biliary
     system and the common bile duct do not appear appreciably dilated.
     
     The main portal vein shows appropriate hepatopetal directional flow.  There is
     a large amount of ascites present.  Recanalized umbilical vein collaterals are
     present.  There is a moderate left pleural effusion and small right pleural
     effusion, with associated atelectasis.
     
     The patient was subsequently recalled in order to attempt a 3D MRCP sequence
     for better delineation of the biliary tract.  Unfortunately, due to body
     habitus, there was insufficient signal from the biliary tree to provide
     additional anatomic information.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Cirrhotic liver, apparantly with moderate biliary dilatation involving the
     left-sided intrahepatic bile ducts, but without dilatation of the right bile
     ducts or the extrahepatic bile ducts.  This is presumably secondary to hilar
     stricture, although further detail could not be obtained despite attempt to
     re-image the patient.
     2.  No discrete mass lesions are identified, although this is a technically
     and habitus-limited examination. 
     3.  There is a large amount of ascites, with moderate left pleural effusion
     and small right pleural effusion.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION:  Pulmonary edema.
     
     PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained on [**2901-8-27**] at 1125 hours and
     compared with the prior radiograph of [**2901-8-25**].  There has been significant
     improvement in the appearance of the bilateral pleural effusions, particularly
     marked on the right side.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Increased
     left-sided retrocardiac density is seen together with obscuration of the left
     hemidiaphragm, which may indicate atelectasis superimposed on pleural
     effusion.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is visualized.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Findings are consistent with improving cardiac failure and improvement of
     bilateral pleural effusions.

     PROCEDURE:
     1.  Selective right hepatic arteriography.
     2.  Common hepatic arteriography.
     3.  Selective splenic arteriography (angiographic portogram).
     
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  49-year-old female with hemobilia subsequent to recent
     endoscopically placed biliary stent.  Declining hematocrit.  History of
     cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C virus.
     
     INFORMED CONSENT:  Informed consent for the procedures above were obtained
     from the patient's family.  The patient herself is unable to provide witnessed
     informed consent due to her medical condition.  Specifically discussed were
     the indications for the procedure as well as their attended risks, potential
     complications, possible alternatives including that of bleeding, infection,
     embolus, contrast reaction, and death.  The patient's family agreed to have
     the procedure performed and provided alternate consent which in turn was
     finally placed in the [**Hospital 122**] medical record.

     DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  Timeout was performed to identify the patient, the
     procedure to be performed, the sites of the procedures, appropriate
     requisition, and appropriate informed consent.  Once verified, the patient was
     positioned in a supine fashion on a special procedure table.  The patient
     arrived to the department intubated on CPAP ventilation.  The right groin was
     prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Utilizing both fluoroscopic
     guidance and ultrasound guidance, uneventful one-wall arterial puncture was
     achieved at the right common femoral artery in a standard retrograde fashion.
     A 0.035-inch [**Last Name (un) 223**] wire was advanced by way of the 4-French catheter of the
     micropuncture access set and steered to the level of the suprarenal abdominal
     aorta.  Subsequently, a 5-French vascular sheath was placed over the guidewire
                                                                 (Over)

     in place to intermittent side arm flush.  A 5-French soft Omni catheter was
     then employed to engage the celiac access.  A 0.035-inch angled glidewire was
     used to cannulate initially the right hepatic artery.  The soft Omni catheter
     was then removed and exchanged for a 5-French C2 glide catheter, which was
     advanced into the right hepatic artery.  Once satisfactory position was
     confirmed using a test injection of contrast, serial power injections were
     made in various obliquities.  Subsequent to the above, the catheter was
     withdrawn into the common hepatic artery where repeat power injections were
     performed.  The catheter was then retracted and with the aid of 0.035-inch
     angled guidewire used to catheterize the splenic artery where power injections
     were made thereupon including delayed venous phase.
     
     Subsequent to satisfactory imaging, a right-sided sheathogram was performed in
     30 degrees ipsilateral obliquity.  Subsequently, a Perclose device was
     deployed at the right groin to control the puncture site.  Due to patient's
     coagulopathy, persistent oozing at the puncture site was noted.  This
     necessitated an additional 20 minutes of digital compression at the puncture
     site over a Syvek hemostatic patch.  The patch was left in place and then
     overlaid with a gauze mount and Elastomer dressing forming a pressure
     dressing.
     
     The patient tolerated the above without immediate complication.
     
     ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  Less than 15 cc total.  No immediate complications
     encountered.
     
     FINDINGS:  The study is abnormal.  Specifically, no extravasation or
     obstruction of blood flow was noted in the hepatic arterial tree.  The liver
     is markedly shrunken and displays marked architectural distortion and
     corkscrewing of the hepatic artery is diffusely throughout its parenchyma.
     Specifically, no pseudoaneurysm or AV fistulization is noted.
     
     Splenic artery injection demonstrates normal arterial parenchymal phase in the
     injection.  However, there is delayed venous opacification in splenic artery.
     The portal vein is not well visualized.  There is a tortuous vessel overlying
     the portahepatus which may represent a varix.  The superior mesenteric vein is
     not visualized.  The coronary vein was not visualized.
     
     Unremarkable right groin sheathogram.
     
     Limited right upper quadrant ultrasound demonstrated marked dilatation of the
     gall bladder with small stones in the gall bladder fundus.  Angiogram
     demonstrated splaying of several small cholecystic arterial branches.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      49 year old woman with hemobilia, continues to drop HCT, hypotensive            
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      possible embolization of hepatic artery                                         
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     PROCEDURE:
     1.  Selective right hepatic arteriography.
     2.  Common hepatic arteriography.
     3.  Selective splenic arteriography (angiographic portogram).
     
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  49-year-old female with hemobilia subsequent to recent
     endoscopically placed biliary stent.  Declining hematocrit.  History of
     cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C virus.
     
     INFORMED CONSENT:  Informed consent for the procedures above were obtained
     from the patient's family.  The patient herself is unable to provide witnessed
     informed consent due to her medical condition.  Specifically discussed were
     the indications for the procedure as well as their attended risks, potential
     complications, possible alternatives including that of bleeding, infection,
     embolus, contrast reaction, and death.  The patient's family agreed to have
     the procedure performed and provided alternate consent which in turn was
     finally placed in the [**Hospital 122**] medical record.
     
     OPERATORS:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1560**] [**Name8 (MD) 389**], M.D. (staff, present and supervising throughout),
                 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 8559**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D. (fellow)
                 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2258**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1721**], M.D. (radiology resident)
     
     DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  Timeout was performed to identify the patient, the
     procedure to be performed, the sites of the procedures, appropriate
     requisition, and appropriate informed consent.  Once verified, the patient was
     positioned in a supine fashion on a special procedure table.  The patient
     arrived to the department intubated on CPAP ventilation.  The right groin was
     prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Utilizing both fluoroscopic
     guidance and ultrasound guidance, uneventful one-wall arterial puncture was
     achieved at the right common femoral artery in a standard retrograde fashion.
     A 0.035-inch [**Last Name (un) 223**] wire was advanced by way of the 4-French catheter of the
     micropuncture access set and steered to the level of the suprarenal abdominal
     aorta.  Subsequently, a 5-French vascular sheath was placed over the guidewire
                                                                 (Over)

     in place to intermittent side arm flush.  A 5-French soft Omni catheter was
     then employed to engage the celiac access.  A 0.035-inch angled glidewire was
     used to cannulate initially the right hepatic artery.  The soft Omni catheter
     was then removed and exchanged for a 5-French C2 glide catheter, which was
     advanced into the right hepatic artery.  Once satisfactory position was
     confirmed using a test injection of contrast, serial power injections were
     made in various obliquities.  Subsequent to the above, the catheter was
     withdrawn into the common hepatic artery where repeat power injections were
     performed.  The catheter was then retracted and with the aid of 0.035-inch
     angled guidewire used to catheterize the splenic artery where power injections
     were made thereupon including delayed venous phase.
     
     Subsequent to satisfactory imaging, a right-sided sheathogram was performed in
     30 degrees ipsilateral obliquity.  Subsequently, a Perclose device was
     deployed at the right groin to control the puncture site.  Due to patient's
     coagulopathy, persistent oozing at the puncture site was noted.  This
     necessitated an additional 20 minutes of digital compression at the puncture
     site over a Syvek hemostatic patch.  The patch was left in place and then
     overlaid with a gauze mount and Elastomer dressing forming a pressure
     dressing.
     
     The patient tolerated the above without immediate complication.
     
     ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  Less than 15 cc total.  No immediate complications
     encountered.
     
     FINDINGS:  The study is abnormal.  Specifically, no extravasation or
     obstruction of blood flow was noted in the hepatic arterial tree.  The liver
     is markedly shrunken and displays marked architectural distortion and
     corkscrewing of the hepatic artery is diffusely throughout its parenchyma.
     Specifically, no pseudoaneurysm or AV fistulization is noted.
     
     Splenic artery injection demonstrates normal arterial parenchymal phase in the
     injection.  However, there is delayed venous opacification in splenic artery.
     The portal vein is not well visualized.  There is a tortuous vessel overlying
     the portahepatus which may represent a varix.  The superior mesenteric vein is
     not visualized.  The coronary vein was not visualized.
     
     Unremarkable right groin sheathogram.
     
     Limited right upper quadrant ultrasound demonstrated marked dilatation of the
     gall bladder with small stones in the gall bladder fundus.  Angiogram
     demonstrated splaying of several small cholecystic arterial branches. 
     
     IMPRESSION:
                                                                 (Over)

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      49 year old woman with hemobilia, continues to drop HCT, hypotensive            
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      possible embolization of hepatic artery                                         
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     PROCEDURE:
     1.  Selective right hepatic arteriography.
     2.  Common hepatic arteriography.
     3.  Selective splenic arteriography (angiographic portogram).
     
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  49-year-old female with hemobilia subsequent to recent
     endoscopically placed biliary stent.  Declining hematocrit.  History of
     cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C virus.
     
     INFORMED CONSENT:  Informed consent for the procedures above were obtained
     from the patient's family.  The patient herself is unable to provide witnessed
     informed consent due to her medical condition.  Specifically discussed were
     the indications for the procedure as well as their attended risks, potential
     complications, possible alternatives including that of bleeding, infection,
     embolus, contrast reaction, and death.  The patient's family agreed to have
     the procedure performed and provided alternate consent which in turn was
     finally placed in the [**Hospital 122**] medical record.
     
     OPERATORS:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1560**] [**Name8 (MD) 389**], M.D. (staff, present and supervising throughout),
                 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 8559**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D. (fellow)
                 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2258**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1721**], M.D. (radiology resident)
     
     DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  Timeout was performed to identify the patient, the
     procedure to be performed, the sites of the procedures, appropriate
     requisition, and appropriate informed consent.  Once verified, the patient was
     positioned in a supine fashion on a special procedure table.  The patient
     arrived to the department intubated on CPAP ventilation.  The right groin was
     prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Utilizing both fluoroscopic
     guidance and ultrasound guidance, uneventful one-wall arterial puncture was
     achieved at the right common femoral artery in a standard retrograde fashion.
     A 0.035-inch [**Last Name (un) 223**] wire was advanced by way of the 4-French catheter of the
     micropuncture access set and steered to the level of the suprarenal abdominal
     aorta.  Subsequently, a 5-French vascular sheath was placed over the guidewire
                                                                 (Over)

     in place to intermittent side arm flush.  A 5-French soft Omni catheter was
     then employed to engage the celiac access.  A 0.035-inch angled glidewire was
     used to cannulate initially the right hepatic artery.  The soft Omni catheter
     was then removed and exchanged for a 5-French C2 glide catheter, which was
     advanced into the right hepatic artery.  Once satisfactory position was
     confirmed using a test injection of contrast, serial power injections were
     made in various obliquities.  Subsequent to the above, the catheter was
     withdrawn into the common hepatic artery where repeat power injections were
     performed.  The catheter was then retracted and with the aid of 0.035-inch
     angled guidewire used to catheterize the splenic artery where power injections
     were made thereupon including delayed venous phase.
     
     Subsequent to satisfactory imaging, a right-sided sheathogram was performed in
     30 degrees ipsilateral obliquity.  Subsequently, a Perclose device was
     deployed at the right groin to control the puncture site.  Due to patient's
     coagulopathy, persistent oozing at the puncture site was noted.  This
     necessitated an additional 20 minutes of digital compression at the puncture
     site over a Syvek hemostatic patch.  The patch was left in place and then
     overlaid with a gauze mount and Elastomer dressing forming a pressure
     dressing.
     
     The patient tolerated the above without immediate complication.
     
     ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  Less than 15 cc total.  No immediate complications
     encountered.
     
     FINDINGS:  The study is abnormal.  Specifically, no extravasation or
     obstruction of blood flow was noted in the hepatic arterial tree.  The liver
     is markedly shrunken and displays marked architectural distortion and
     corkscrewing of the hepatic artery is diffusely throughout its parenchyma.
     Specifically, no pseudoaneurysm or AV fistulization is noted.

     in place to intermittent side arm flush.  A 5-French soft Omni catheter was
     then employed to engage the celiac access.  A 0.035-inch angled glidewire was
     used to cannulate initially the right hepatic artery.  The soft Omni catheter
     was then removed and exchanged for a 5-French C2 glide catheter, which was
     advanced into the right hepatic artery.  Once satisfactory position was
     confirmed using a test injection of contrast, serial power injections were
     made in various obliquities.  Subsequent to the above, the catheter was
     withdrawn into the common hepatic artery where repeat power injections were
     performed.  The catheter was then retracted and with the aid of 0.035-inch
     angled guidewire used to catheterize the splenic artery where power injections
     were made thereupon including delayed venous phase.
     
     Subsequent to satisfactory imaging, a right-sided sheathogram was performed in
     30 degrees ipsilateral obliquity.  Subsequently, a Perclose device was
     deployed at the right groin to control the puncture site.  Due to patient's
     coagulopathy, persistent oozing at the puncture site was noted.  This
     necessitated an additional 20 minutes of digital compression at the puncture
     site over a Syvek hemostatic patch.  The patch was left in place and then
     overlaid with a gauze mount and Elastomer dressing forming a pressure
     dressing.
     
     The patient tolerated the above without immediate complication.
     
     ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  Less than 15 cc total.  No immediate complications
     encountered.
     
     FINDINGS:  The study is abnormal.  Specifically, no extravasation or
     obstruction of blood flow was noted in the hepatic arterial tree.  The liver
     is markedly shrunken and displays marked architectural distortion and
     corkscrewing of the hepatic artery is diffusely throughout its parenchyma.
     Specifically, no pseudoaneurysm or AV fistulization is noted.
     
     Splenic artery injection demonstrates normal arterial parenchymal phase in the
     injection.  However, there is delayed venous opacification in splenic artery.
     The portal vein is not well visualized.  There is a tortuous vessel overlying
     the portahepatus which may represent a varix.  The superior mesenteric vein is
     not visualized.  The coronary vein was not visualized.
     
     Unremarkable right groin sheathogram.
     
     Limited right upper quadrant ultrasound demonstrated marked dilatation of the

     PROCEDURE:
     1.  Selective right hepatic arteriography.
     2.  Common hepatic arteriography.
     3.  Selective splenic arteriography (angiographic portogram).
     
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  49-year-old female with hemobilia subsequent to recent
     endoscopically placed biliary stent.  Declining hematocrit.  History of
     cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C virus.
     
     INFORMED CONSENT:  Informed consent for the procedures above were obtained
     from the patient's family.  The patient herself is unable to provide witnessed
     informed consent due to her medical condition.  Specifically discussed were
     the indications for the procedure as well as their attended risks, potential
     complications, possible alternatives including that of bleeding, infection,
     embolus, contrast reaction, and death.  The patient's family agreed to have
     the procedure performed and provided alternate consent which in turn was
     finally placed in the [**Hospital 122**] medical record.
     
     OPERATORS:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1560**] [**Name8 (MD) 389**], M.D. (staff, present and supervising throughout),

     DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  Timeout was performed to identify the patient, the
     procedure to be performed, the sites of the procedures, appropriate
     requisition, and appropriate informed consent.  Once verified, the patient was
     positioned in a supine fashion on a special procedure table.  The patient
     arrived to the department intubated on CPAP ventilation.  The right groin was
     prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Utilizing both fluoroscopic
     guidance and ultrasound guidance, uneventful one-wall arterial puncture was
     achieved at the right common femoral artery in a standard retrograde fashion.
     A 0.035-inch [**Last Name (un) 223**] wire was advanced by way of the 4-French catheter of the
     micropuncture access set and steered to the level of the suprarenal abdominal
     aorta.  Subsequently, a 5-French vascular sheath was placed over the guidewire
                                                                 (Over)

     3.  Selective splenic arteriography (angiographic portogram).
     
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  49-year-old female with hemobilia subsequent to recent
     endoscopically placed biliary stent.  Declining hematocrit.  History of
     cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C virus.
     
     INFORMED CONSENT:  Informed consent for the procedures above were obtained
     from the patient's family.  The patient herself is unable to provide witnessed
     informed consent due to her medical condition.  Specifically discussed were
     the indications for the procedure as well as their attended risks, potential
     complications, possible alternatives including that of bleeding, infection,
     embolus, contrast reaction, and death.  The patient's family agreed to have
     the procedure performed and provided alternate consent which in turn was
     finally placed in the [**Hospital 122**] medical record.
     
     OPERATORS:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1560**] [**Name8 (MD) 389**], M.D. (staff, present and supervising throughout),

     DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  Timeout was performed to identify the patient, the
     procedure to be performed, the sites of the procedures, appropriate
     requisition, and appropriate informed consent.  Once verified, the patient was
     positioned in a supine fashion on a special procedure table.  The patient
     arrived to the department intubated on CPAP ventilation.  The right groin was
     prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Utilizing both fluoroscopic
     guidance and ultrasound guidance, uneventful one-wall arterial puncture was
     achieved at the right common femoral artery in a standard retrograde fashion.
     A 0.035-inch [**Last Name (un) 223**] wire was advanced by way of the 4-French catheter of the
     micropuncture access set and steered to the level of the suprarenal abdominal
     aorta.  Subsequently, a 5-French vascular sheath was placed over the guidewire
                                                                 (Over)

     in place to intermittent side arm flush.  A 5-French soft Omni catheter was
     then employed to engage the celiac access.  A 0.035-inch angled glidewire was
     used to cannulate initially the right hepatic artery.  The soft Omni catheter
     was then removed and exchanged for a 5-French C2 glide catheter, which was
     advanced into the right hepatic artery.  Once satisfactory position was
     confirmed using a test injection of contrast, serial power injections were
     made in various obliquities.  Subsequent to the above, the catheter was
     withdrawn into the common hepatic artery where repeat power injections were
     performed.  The catheter was then retracted and with the aid of 0.035-inch
     angled guidewire used to catheterize the splenic artery where power injections
     were made thereupon including delayed venous phase.
     
     Subsequent to satisfactory imaging, a right-sided sheathogram was performed in
     30 degrees ipsilateral obliquity.  Subsequently, a Perclose device was
     deployed at the right groin to control the puncture site.  Due to patient's
     coagulopathy, persistent oozing at the puncture site was noted.  This
     necessitated an additional 20 minutes of digital compression at the puncture
     site over a Syvek hemostatic patch.  The patch was left in place and then
     overlaid with a gauze mount and Elastomer dressing forming a pressure
     dressing.
     
     The patient tolerated the above without immediate complication.
     
     ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  Less than 15 cc total.  No immediate complications
     encountered.
     
     FINDINGS:  The study is abnormal.  Specifically, no extravasation or
     obstruction of blood flow was noted in the hepatic arterial tree.  The liver
     is markedly shrunken and displays marked architectural distortion and
     corkscrewing of the hepatic artery is diffusely throughout its parenchyma.
     Specifically, no pseudoaneurysm or AV fistulization is noted.
     
     Splenic artery injection demonstrates normal arterial parenchymal phase in the
     injection.  However, there is delayed venous opacification in splenic artery.
     The portal vein is not well visualized.  There is a tortuous vessel overlying
     the portahepatus which may represent a varix.  The superior mesenteric vein is
     not visualized.  The coronary vein was not visualized.
     
     Unremarkable right groin sheathogram.
     
     Limited right upper quadrant ultrasound demonstrated marked dilatation of the
     gall bladder with small stones in the gall bladder fundus.  Angiogram
     demonstrated splaying of several small cholecystic arterial branches.

     INDICATION:  49-year-old woman with HCV cirrhosis,status post biliary stent,
     possible stent migration with dilated gallbladder with stone, high-grade GNR,
     bacteremia.  Please evaluate for cholecystitis and position of biliary stent.
     
     COMPARISON:  MRCP [**2901-8-17**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contrast-enhanced axial CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were
     obtained with coronally and sagittally reformatted images.  100 cc of IV
     Optiray contrast was used.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The lung bases reveal a right-sided
     moderate pleural effusion and a left-sided larger pleural effusion.
     Compression atelectasis associated with these effusions is noted bilaterally.
     The visualized portions of the heart and pericardium are unremarkable.  The
     liver is noted to be nodular and irregular in contour. Biliary dilatation is
     noted predominantly of the left lobe.  The gallbladder appears fluid filled
     and dilated with small stones noted dependently.  A biliary stent appears to
     be displaced inferiorly further into the common bile duct.  Dilated
     periumbilical varices are again seen.  A subcapsular wedge shaped defect of
     the posterior aspect of the spleen is visualized, likely representing a
     splenic infarct.  The portal vein appears enlarged measuring approximately 15
     mm.  The pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys appear unremarkable.  An NG
     tube is noted within the fundus of the stomach.  A large amount of ascites and
     anasarca is identified.  No free air is seen.  No pathologically enlarged
     lymph nodes are identified.  Intra-abdominal loops of large bowel are
     unremarkable.  Small bowel may be mildly dilated suggesting a possible ileus;
     however, it appears otherwise unremarkable.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The rectum and sigmoid colon are
     unremarkable.  The uterus and adnexa are within normal limits.  Foley is
     present within the bladder, and air is seen non-dependently.  Fluid is
     identified within the pelvis.  No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are
     seen.  A potential ulcer of the right of midline ventral skin surface is
     identified at the level of the symphysis pubis, measuring approximately 6 x 8
     x 2.7 cm.
     
     Osseous structures reveal no worrisome lytic or sclerotic lesions.
     
     Coronal and sagittal reformations support the above findings.
                                                                 (Over)

     obtained with coronally and sagittally reformatted images.  100 cc of IV
     Optiray contrast was used.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The lung bases reveal a right-sided
     moderate pleural effusion and a left-sided larger pleural effusion.
     Compression atelectasis associated with these effusions is noted bilaterally.
     The visualized portions of the heart and pericardium are unremarkable.  The
     liver is noted to be nodular and irregular in contour. Biliary dilatation is
     noted predominantly of the left lobe.  The gallbladder appears fluid filled
     and dilated with small stones noted dependently.  A biliary stent appears to
     be displaced inferiorly further into the common bile duct.  Dilated
     periumbilical varices are again seen.  A subcapsular wedge shaped defect of
     the posterior aspect of the spleen is visualized, likely representing a
     splenic infarct.  The portal vein appears enlarged measuring approximately 15
     mm.  The pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys appear unremarkable.  An NG
     tube is noted within the fundus of the stomach.  A large amount of ascites and
     anasarca is identified.  No free air is seen.  No pathologically enlarged
     lymph nodes are identified.  Intra-abdominal loops of large bowel are
     unremarkable.  Small bowel may be mildly dilated suggesting a possible ileus;
     however, it appears otherwise unremarkable.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The rectum and sigmoid colon are
     unremarkable.  The uterus and adnexa are within normal limits.  Foley is
     present within the bladder, and air is seen non-dependently.  Fluid is
     identified within the pelvis.  No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are
     seen.  A potential ulcer of the right of midline ventral skin surface is
     identified at the level of the symphysis pubis, measuring approximately 6 x 8
     x 2.7 cm.
     
     Osseous structures reveal no worrisome lytic or sclerotic lesions.
     
     Coronal and sagittal reformations support the above findings.
                                                                 (Over)

     IMPRESSION:  
     
     1.  Displacement of biliary stent inferiorly into common bile duct with
     potential cystic duct blockage and gallbladder dilatation.  Focal biliary
     dilatation of the left lobe of the liver is also identified suggesting stent
     malfunction.ERCP recommended .

     appearance.  There is interval improvement of the previously identified
     right-sided pleural effusion.  The trachea is midline.  Nodular contour of the
     right hilum is likely attributable to prominent vessels.

     Reason: Please evaluate for worsening effusion, infiltrates or conso
     Admitting Diagnosis: UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      49 year old woman with ESLD, PFO, left effusion with worsening O2 saturation.   
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Please evaluate for worsening effusion, infiltrates or consolidations           
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Worsening oxygen saturation levels.  Known left pleural effusion.
     
     COMPARISON:  Prior chest x-ray from [**2901-9-10**].
     
     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:  A single view frontal chest radiograph was obtained
     in a semi-upright position.
     
     As compared to the prior film, there has been interval worsening of the left-
     sided pleural effusion, which obscures now between a third and a half of the
     left hemithorax and the cardiac apex as well.  The prominence of the right
     lung hilum remains unchanged.  The left internal jugular venous line and the
     nasogastric tube remain unchanged.  There has been interval removal of the
     endotracheal tube.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Interval worsening of the left-sided pleural effusion.  Unchanged
     appearance of the prominent right hilar contour.  Interval removal of the
     endotracheal tube.

     AP CHEST, 5:31 a.m. [**9-14**].
     
     HISTORY:  End-stage liver disease, worsening hypoxia.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**9-10**] and 17:
     
     Moderate left pleural effusion posteriorly distributed in the supine position
     is probably unchanged in volume since [**9-13**], though increased since [**9-10**]. Consolidation at the medial aspect of the left lung base could be
     pneumonia or atelectasis, unchanged.  Atelectasis adjacent to the right hilus
     changes in distribution but not in severity.  Heart size mildly enlarged and
     pulmonary and mediastinal and vasculature mildly engorged may be due in part
     to supine positioning, as well as presumed volume overload.  No pneumothorax. 
     Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  Left jugular line
     tip projects over the mid SVC.
