Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and
rhythm.  A 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the base.  There
was no jugular venous distention.  There was a faint
holosystolic murmur at the apex.  The lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, nontender,

through XII were intact bilaterally.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood
cell count was 3.7, her hematocrit was 29.6, and her
platelets were 200.  Sodium was 138, potassium was 2.7, blood
urea nitrogen was 53, and her creatinine was 2.0.
Alanine-aminotransferase was 31.  Her aspartate
aminotransferase was 20.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram showed a
normal sinus rhythm with first-degree AV block, right
bundle-branch block, left axis.  There were T wave inversions
in lead aVL and V1 to V3.  LVH.

An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 60% to 65%.
Moderately dilated left atrium and mildly dilated right
atrium.  Normal left ventricular wall thickness and cavity
size.  Normal right ventricular size and free wall motion.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  POSITIVE STRESS TEST ISSUES:  The patient was transferred
from [**Hospital3 **] for a positive stress test concerning
for a left anterior descending artery lesion.

The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization which
revealed a right-dominant system, with an angiographically
normal left main coronary artery.  The left anterior
descending artery had a proximal 40% stenosis followed by a
70% stenosis after S1.  A very distal limb was occluded at
the apex.  The left circumflex was a large vessel with
significant tortuosity and distal complex 90% stenosis at
second obtuse marginal.  The first obtuse marginal was small
and had a 90% origin lesion.

A left ventriculography revealed an estimated ejection
fraction of 45% with trace mitral regurgitation.

The left anterior descending artery was stented with a drug
eluding stent, and the left circumflex was stented with a
drug eluding stent.

The patient had normal left-sided filling pressures.  During
the catheterization, the patient developed bradycardia with a
heart rate in the 20s with 2:1 atrioventricular block and
required a temporary pacer wire to be placed in the right
ventricle.

The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Intensive Care
Unit for monitoring until a pacemaker was placed.  The
patient was continued on aspirin and was placed on Plavix.
She will need at least ninth months of Plavix.  The patient's
Lipitor was increased to 80 mg once per day, and she was
continued on labetalol.  Her ACE inhibitor was continued at
30 mg once per day as her creatinine had been stable at this
dose.

2.  BRADYCARDIA ISSUES:  The patient developed bradycardia
during cardiac catheterization requiring a temporary pacer
wire to be placed.  The patient was then seen by
Electrophysiology and had a pacemaker placed several hours
after cardiac catheterization.  The pacemaker was functioning
appropriately, and the leads were in the correct location
based on a chest x-ray.  There was no evidence of
pneumothorax on her chest x-ray.

3.  CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY ISSUES:  The patient with a
baseline creatinine in the 1.5 to 1.7 range.  The etiology of
her chronic renal insufficiency is unknown; as to whether it
is vascular or due to hypertensive or diabetic nephropathy.
The patient was to follow up with her primary care physician
for blood pressure and blood sugar checks to insure that her
hypertension and her diabetes are well controlled.

4.  ANEMIA ISSUES:  The patient has a baseline anemia that is
reported to be due to anemia of chronic renal disease and
iron deficiency anemia; however, it was unclear as to whether
or not the patient has ever had a workup for her iron
deficiency anemia.  An appropriate workup for this should
include a colonoscopy.  This was communicated to the patient,
and she should discuss this with her primary care physician,
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] she should have a colonoscopy within one to two months of
discharge if she has not had one recently.  The patient was
continued on her Epogen and iron replacement.

The patient also required a transfusion of 2 units of packed
red blood cells for a hematocrit of 25 after her cardiac
catheterization and pacemaker placement.  On the day after
her transfusion, her hematocrit was found to be 33.  The
patient should have her hematocrit checked within one week of
discharge.

5.  LEFT SECOND TOE CELLULITIS ISSUES:  The patient had an
area of erythema, warmth, and tenderness over the dorsal
surface of her left second toe; consistent with cellulitis
and a diabetic foot.  The patient was treated with renally
dosed Augmentin 500 mg once per day and was to complete a
10-day course of antibiotics with an additional 7 days after
discharge.  The patient should follow up with her primary
care physician within one week of discharge to recheck this
toe to make sure that it is healing appropriately.

6.  AORTIC STENOSIS ISSUES:  The patient had an
echocardiogram at the outside hospital which reported a valve
area of 0.9 cm2.  The patient was asymptomatic from this
aortic stenosis, and should be managed medically at this
point.  The patient should follow up with her cardiologist
within three to four weeks as her aortic stenosis may become
an issue for her in the future.

7.  DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was admitted on
glyburide 5 mg by mouth twice per day.  During this
admission, her glyburide was held.  The patient was placed on
a regular insulin sliding-scale.  On discharge, she was
restarted on her glyburide.  The patient should follow up
with her primary care physician as she may benefit from
long-acting insulin therapy.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  Please follow up with your primary care doctor in one
week.
2.  Please follow up with your cardiologist in three to four
weeks.
3.  Please follow up at the Device Clinic for your pacemaker
in one week.
4.  Please have your primary care doctor work up your iron
deficiency anemia.  [**Doctor First Name 10**] should have a colonoscopy soon after
discharge as part of this evaluation if [**Doctor First Name **] have not already
had one recently.
