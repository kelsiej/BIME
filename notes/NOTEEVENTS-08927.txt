     Reason: r/o worsening mets, spinal cord compression, epidural absces
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      65 year old woman with metastatic rectal ca, known spinal mets, now with 
      worsening lower extremity weakness, low back pain, and fevers.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      r/o worsening mets, spinal cord compression, epidural abscess                   
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:
     
     TECHNIQUE:   Sagittal and axial T1 and T2 weighted images of the cervical,
     thoracic and lumbar spine, without contrast.
     
     COMPARISON: [**3137-10-11**]
     
     FINDINGS: In the cervical spine, abnormally increased signal is seen on STIR
     images within the C2 vertebral body, finding unchanged from the prior study.
     Note is again made of a high signal region in the medulla, at the level of the
     obex.  The region of increased signal at the C3 level is not clearly
     demonstrated on the current study.
     
     Unchanged mild cervical spondylosis is greatest at the C3-4, C5-6 and C6-7
     levels.
     
     At the T1 level, there is diffusely an abnormally increased signal within the
     vertebral body on STIR images.  Heterogeneously increased signal is seen
     within the T3 body.
     
     At the T8 level, there is mildly increased signal.
     
     A focal rounded area of increased signal is again seen within the center of
     the T9 vertebral body, likely a hemangioma.
     
     The T11 and T12 vertebral bodies demonstrate patchy increased signal, and the
     osseous structures are deformed by partial compression.  No area of
     retropulsion into the spinal canal is seen.
     
     Within the lumbar spine, there is diffuse abnormal T2 signal within the
     majority of the vertebral bodies, particularly the L2 body.  Previously
     described retroperitoneal adenopathy is not well demonstrated due to the
     obscuring saturation pulse anterior to the spine.  An unchanged pathologic
     compression fracture of the L5 vertebral body is present, with some mild
     retropulsion of the posterior cortex.
     
     The L1-2 level demonstrates no significant spinal stenosis.  Mild disc
     desiccation is present, without loss of intervertebral disc height.  No neural
     foraminal narrowing is identified.  At the L2-3 level, there is moderate loss
     of intervertebral disc height, with an irregular disc protrusion having
     lateral components extending into the  neural foramina.  The pedicles are
                                                                 (Over)

     congenitally short, and there is moderate degenerative proliferation of the
     facet joints.  These features cause moderate spinal stenosis and crowding of
     the nerve roots.  At the L3-4 level, there is moderate loss of intervertebral
     disc height and a left disc protrusion extending into the neural foramen.
     Congenitally short pedicles, moderate degenerative proliferation of the facet
     joints and moderate thickening of the ligamentum flavum cause moderate spinal
     stenosis at this level and near complete obliteration of the CSF space.  All
     nerve roots are crowded centrally.
     
     At the L4-5 level, there is marked loss of intervertebral disc height and a
     large disc protrusion.  Marked proliferation degeneration of the facet joints
     is present, as well as moderate thickening of the ligamentum flavum and
     congenitally short pedicles.  These features, as well as the retropulsion of
     the posterior L5 cortex, cause severe spinal stenosis at this level, with an
     AP diameter of 4 mm.  No CSF space is present.  There is severe neural
     foraminal narrowing bilaterally.
     
     At the L5-S1 level, moderate degenerative proliferation of the facet joints is
     present, with moderate right neural foraminal narrowing.
     
     A high signal lesion is seen within the posterior right ischium.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     Diffuse metastatic disease of the entire spine, unchanged in distribution from
     the prior study.  Slight increase in the extent of the preexisting metastases
     may have occurred.  Significant severe spinal stenosis is grossly unchanged
     from the prior study and is due in most part to long standing chronic
     conditions; congenitally short pedicles, multiple disc protrusions, and
     degenerative facet joint disease.
     
     In summary, given the lack of progression of the multiple compression
     fractures and the stable retropulsed L5 vertebral compression, the patient's
     current neurological symptoms are likely to relate to underlying mechanical
     factors of spinal stenosis, with superimposed, but relatively stable
     metastatic osseous neoplastic disease.

     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are new bilateral pleural effusions, right
     greater than left, with associated basilar atelectasis.  There is a stable
     pericardial effusion.  No identified pulmonary nodules.  Again seen are
     multiple low attenuation lesions within the left and right lobes of the liver,
     unchanged and too small to characterize. No biliary ductal dilatation.  The
     gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys, and spleen are within normal
     limits.  There is no change in the retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  There is
     no free air or free fluid within the abdomen. There are no drainable fluid
     collections or abscesses.  There is no dilatation or wall thickening within
     the large or small bowel.  The left paraaortic lymph node measures
     approximately 1.6 x 1.5 cm.  The retroaortic lymph node measures approximately
     1.4 x 2.2 cm.  No pathologically enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes.  The
     colostomy is identified within the left lower quadrant.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectal stent is unchanged.  Wall thickening
     within the rectum is also unchanged.  No evidence of obstruction.  The urinary
     bladder, uterus, and adnexa are within normal limits.  The ureters are normal.
     No free fluid within the pelvis.
     
     BONE WINDOWS: No significant change in the lytic lesions within the left and
     right iliac bones.

     INDICATION:  Metastatic renal carcinoma.  Fever.  Altered mental status.  Rule
     out pneumonia.
     
     FINDINGS:  A single AP upright image.  Comparison study dated [**3138-2-17**].
     There is again evidence of moderate cardiac enlargement, mainly left
     ventricular.  Slight upper zone redistribution may be present.  This could be
     partly postural if the patient is semiupright, but minimal LV failure cannot
     be excluded.  No pulmonary infiltrates or pleural effusions are demonstrated.
     Some minor atelectasis is noted in the basal segments of the left lower lobe
     behind the heart.  A right subclavian port-a-cath is present with its tip well
     positioned in the SVC.
     
     IMPRESSION:  LV enlargement and possible minimal upper zone redistribution.
     Very slight LV failure cannot be excluded but the findings may be postural.
     No evidence of metastases can be identified.

     CHEST CT WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The right lobe of the thyroid gland is
     enlarged, heterogenous and nodular.  There is no mediastinal, hilar or
     axillary lymphadenopathy. There is a small area of ill- defined ground- glass
     opacity in the lingula, which is consistent with an infectious/inflammatory
     process. Clinical correlation is suggested. There is a 4-mm faint nodular
     opacity at the right apex, and a 4-mm faint nodular opacity at the left apex,
     which are nonspecific.  There is a 2- mm nodule in the right middle lobe.
     
     Bilateral pleural effusions remain present, unchanged since the prior study.
     They do not enhance.  Associated bibasilar atelectasis is present.  There is

     appear patent to the level of the segmental bronchi.
     
     ABDOMEN CT WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is no free air or free fluid.
     Previously described subcentimeter low-attenuation liver lesions are again
     seen. The gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are
     unremarkable. Bulky retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is again noted, unchanged
     since the prior study.  A colostomy is again noted in the left lower quadrant.
     Loops of bowel are again seen in a parastomal hernia, without evidence of
     obstruction.
     
     PELVIS CT WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The rectum appears unchanged, with a
     stent again noted.  There is a Foley catheter within the bladder.  The
     ureters, uterus and adnexa are unremarkable.  There is no free fluid.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      65 year old woman with metastatic rectal cancer, now with LE weakness, 
      persistent fevers
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Please eval for infiltrates, consolidation, loculated effusion, abscess, 
      inflammation
     No contraindications for IV contrast

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     HISTORY:  Metastatic rectal cancer, on chemotherapy.  Persistent fevers. Known
     pleural effusions.  Assess for empyema or abdominal abscess.
     
     COMPARISON:  Abdomen/pelvis CT of [**3138-2-18**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images of the chest, abdomen
     and pelvis were obtained with oral contrast and 150 cc of intravenous Optiray.
     
     CHEST CT WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The right lobe of the thyroid gland is
     enlarged, heterogenous and nodular.  There is no mediastinal, hilar or
     axillary lymphadenopathy. There is a small area of ill- defined ground- glass
     opacity in the lingula, which is consistent with an infectious/inflammatory
     process. Clinical correlation is suggested. There is a 4-mm faint nodular
     opacity at the right apex, and a 4-mm faint nodular opacity at the left apex,
     which are nonspecific.  There is a 2- mm nodule in the right middle lobe.
     
     Bilateral pleural effusions remain present, unchanged since the prior study.
     They do not enhance.  Associated bibasilar atelectasis is present.  There is
     also a prominent pericardial effusion, which does not enhance.  The airways
     appear patent to the level of the segmental bronchi.
     
     ABDOMEN CT WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is no free air or free fluid.
     Previously described subcentimeter low-attenuation liver lesions are again
     seen. The gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are
     unremarkable. Bulky retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is again noted, unchanged
     since the prior study.  A colostomy is again noted in the left lower quadrant.
     Loops of bowel are again seen in a parastomal hernia, without evidence of
     obstruction.
     
     PELVIS CT WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The rectum appears unchanged, with a
     stent again noted.  There is a Foley catheter within the bladder.  The
     ureters, uterus and adnexa are unremarkable.  There is no free fluid.
     
     Previously-described lytic lesions are again noted within the pelvic bones
     bilaterally.  There is increased diffuse anasarca.
     
     IMPRESSION:
                                                                 (Over)

     CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITHIOUT IV CONTRAST:
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helical scanning is performed from the diaphragm through the
     symphysis, prior to and during dynamic injection of 150 cc of Optiray.
     Comparison is made to a prior study of [**3138-2-25**].
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The lung bases are clear.
     There is a moderate pericardial effusion which is stable in comparison to the
     prior study.  Again noted is a subcentimeter hypodense lesions within segment
     2 of the liver.  This is stable in appearance and too small to characterize.
     No additional or new lesions are seen.  The spleen, pancreas, both adrenal
     glands, gallbladder, and both kidneys are unremarkable.  Again noted is
     extensive retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy which is stable in appearance.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a colostomy in left lower
     quadrant with a parastomal hernia.  There is no evidence of obstruction.  A
     Foley catheter is identified within the bladder.  Again noted are multiple
     sclerotic lesions throughout the depicted osseous structures.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No change in comparison to [**3138-2-25**].
