Started on an amiodarone drip at 9AM [**3269-3-1**] at 0.5mg/min for 18 
hours.  Medtronics check pt's AICD and found the V Tach rate to 
be set too low for the AICD to fire.  Pt was also started on a 
neosynephrine drip for hypotension.  Pt was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12530**] 
at Caritas, and decision was made to transfer to [**Hospital1 83**] for 
management because her physicians and records are here.

EP Study:
Inducible VT upon stimulation of aorta.  No ablation.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 262**] is a 72 yo woman with CHF, COPD, s/p AICD, 
transferred from OSH with V Tach on amiodarone and neosynephrine 
drips.  AICD did not fire.  

Rhythm: Pt presented to OSH in V Tach and was converted to SR 
with an amidarone bolus and maintained on an amiodarone drip for 
18 hours.  She remained in a paced sinus rhythm without 
symptoms.  Pt was seen by the EP service who adjusted her ICD to 
begin anti-tachycardia pacing at 130 beats/min (AVP).  She 
underwent an EP study on [**3269-3-4**], showing inducible VT upon 
stimulation of the aorta.  No ablation was done.  Pt was 
discharged on 25mg Toprol qd, decreased from her outpt dose of 
50mg, because of hypotension to SBP = 80.

Pump: h/o CHF: Pt is on coumadin for cardiomyopathy with an EF 
of 20%.  She did not have any symptoms of CHF during admission.  
Restarted on outpt Lasix 20 qd.

Cor: Pt was hypotensive after conversion and placed on a 
neosynephrine drip for one day.  Of note, pt has low blood 
pressure at baseline.  Pt on ASA 81, Zocor, Toprol (decreased to 
25mg qd).

Endocrine: Pt has h/o thyroid toxicity d/t amiodarone.  She was 
hyperthyroid for > 1yr, on Tapozole.  Per her records, her 
amiodarone was discontinued in [**3268-10-26**].  She subsequently 
developed hypothyroidism on Tapozole, which was discontinued 
during this admission.  On exam, pt does have a palpable nodule 
but she is refusing fine needle biopsy at this time.  She will 
need a biopsy as an out patient, and recheck of her TFT's.

pt transfered from good [**Hospital 6364**] hospital.   A+ox3. on [**2-28**] patient complained of feeling sweaty, clammy, and diaphoretic, then experienced chest pressure that did not go away so she called EMS.  At the hospital she was found to be in a wide complex tachycardia with hypotension.  She was given an amnioderone bolus and started on amnioderone gtt as well as neosenephrine for her hypotension and transfered to [**Hospital1 22**].  On admission VSS on 0.7 mcg/kg/min of neosenephrine and 0.5 of amnioderone.  Pt denies any allergies, but states in the past when she took amnioderone she developed hyperthyroidism and lost a lot of weight.  Her hypothyroidism resolved when the amnioderone was stoped.  She denies pain or SOB.  O2 sats 98-100% on room air.  LS clear to ascultation a bit diminished in the bases.  Abdomen soft non-tender positive BS.  Voiding clear yellow urine in the bedpan.  labs sent and ekg obtained on admission.  Awaiting further orders.  Continuous telemetry and watch VS closely for any arrythmias and hypotension.  Pt oriented to environment, notified family of where she is, and call bell in reach. Pt instructed to call for nurse if she experiences any SOB, chest pressure/pain or feeling sweaty/diaphoretic.
