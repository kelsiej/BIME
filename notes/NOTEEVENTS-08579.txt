                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:    77 y/o male with a history of renal cell cancer, weight loss
     and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
     
     TECHNIQUE:   Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung apices through the pubic symphysis after the administration of oral
     contrast and 100 cc of IV Optiray. Noncontrast and early images were also
     performed through the liver.
     
     COMPARISONS:  [**3274-4-16**].
     
     CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  Again, there is extensive mediastinal adenopathy.
     These have increased in size since the prior study.  A prevascular node
     currently measures 3.3 x 2.9 cm (previously 2.4 x 2.3 cm). The large
     subcarinal lymph node currently measures 5.8 x 3.9 cm (previously 5.4 x 3.6
     cm).  Other lymph nodes have increased in size by visual inspection. There is
     no axillary adenopathy. There are small bilateral pleural effusions which are
     increasing since the prior exam. There are coarse calcifications within the
     coronary arteries and the aortic arch.
     
     On lung windows there is evidence of perihilar congestion and pulmonary edema.
     There are new nodular densities most prominent centrally in the pulmonary
     parenchyma consistent with worsening metastatic disease. A nodule in the left
     lower lobe currently measures 12 mm and previously measured 11 mm.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST: The liver, gallbladder, spleen, adrenals
     and pancreas are within normal limits. There are numerous surgical clips in
     the left upper quadrant presumably related to a left nephrectomy. Both of
     these kidneys are markedly atrophic and contain numerous cysts.  There are no
     definite retroperitoneal adenopathy.  The bowel loops are grossly
     unremarkable.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The urinary bladder is collapsed.  There is prostatic
     enlargement. The pelvic bowel loops are unremarkable. There is no pelvic free
     fluid. There is bilateral mass containing inguinal hernias.

Admission Date:  [**3274-6-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**3274-6-29**]

Date of Birth:   [**3196-10-7**]     Sex:  M

Service:  MICU Green

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypoxia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old
gentleman with renal cell carcinoma originally diagnosed in
[**3266**].  The patient had bilateral partial nephrectomies at
that time for chromophobe oocytic component tumor (grade II
to III) with 4.5 cm skin size with capillary penetration but
negative margins.

Cancer was quiescent until two months ago when metastases
were noted in the patient's lungs.  The patient presents with
progressive dyspnea on exertion over the past two weeks and
an oxygen saturation in the 80s on the day of admission at
his oncologist's office.  Prior oxygen saturation in [**Female First Name (un) 493**] had
been 99%.  As noted, a chest x-ray in [**3274-4-12**] showed
hilar lymphadenopathy and a bronchoscopy with biopsy showed
metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

The patient denies fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, chest
pain, and palpitations.  The patient has had a chronic cough
for months which has been intermittently productive of yellow
and green sputum.  The patient has complained of anorexia
over the past several weeks.  The patient notes orthopnea
requiring him to [**Doctor Last Name 314**] on two pillows, but no paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea.

The patient went to his oncologist on [**6-25**] for an
appointment and had low oxygen saturations to 83% and was
sent to the Emergency Department.

In the Emergency Department, the patient responded to 3
liters of oxygen with oxygen saturations coming up to 92% but
had an increasing oxygen requirement.  The patient was seen
by the Primary Medicine team at 4 a.m. and was short of
breath on 100% nonrebreather but was mentating well.  An
arterial blood gas at that time revealed pH was 7.56, PCO2
was 38, and PO2 was 38.

The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit for further evaluation.  The chest x-ray on admission
was consistent with congestive heart failure with small
bilateral pleural effusions.  The patient's last dialysis had
been on [**3274-6-23**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Renal cell carcinoma diagnosed in [**3266**] with bilateral
partial nephrectomies; chromophobe oocytic component tumor
(grade II to III); 4.5 cm; capillary penetration; and
negative margins.  The patient has been on dialysis since
[**3267**].
 2.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
 3.  Hypertension.
 4.  Coronary artery disease with a myocardial infarction in
[**3240**] and a normal echocardiogram in [**3270**].
 5.  Seizure disorder (however the patient is no longer on
Dilantin).
 6.  History of transient ischemic attacks.
 7.  Vascular dementia.
 8.  Gout.
 9.  History of gastrointestinal bleed resulting in a
hemicolectomy.
10.  Psoriasis.
11.  Type 2 diabetes.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (Medications on admission were as
follows)
 1.  Celexa 20 mg p.o. once per day.
 2.  Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. once per day.
 3.  Metoprolol 75 mg p.o. once per day.
 4.  Isosorbide mononitrate 90 mg p.o. once per day.
 5.  Zantac 150 mg p.o. once per day.
 6.  Zestril 20 mg p.o. once per day.
 7.  Clarinex 5 mg p.o. once per day.
 8.  Ticlid 250 mg p.o. once per day.
 9.  Renagel 21 mg p.o. twice per day.
10.  Phos-Lo 3 p.o. three times per day.
11.  Nephrocaps one tablet p.o. once per day.

ALLERGIES:  Allergy to ASPIRIN (which causes bleeding) and to
PENICILLIN (which causes a rash).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was a building wrecker for about
20 to 30 years beginning in the 1940s and then a salesman.
The patient does not have a smoking history.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history was noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed temperature was 96.3, heart rate was
76, blood pressure was 190/80, the respiratory rate was 21,
and the oxygen saturation was 80% to 92% on a 100%
nonrebreather mask.  In general, the patient was in no acute
distress.  Alert and oriented times three.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose, and throat examination revealed pupils were equal,
round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements were
intact.  The neck was supple with no jugular venous
distention.  Pulmonary examination revealed the patient's
lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally/anteriorly.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and
rhythm.  No murmurs appreciated.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
Extremity examination revealed no edema.  Dorsalis pedis
pulses were 2+ bilaterally.  Neurologic examination revealed
no gross deficits.  Skin examination revealed multiple
psoriatic plaques on the scalp.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories
on admission revealed white blood cell count was 8,
hematocrit was 38, and platelets were 280.  Sodium was 139,
potassium was 3.9, chloride was 92, bicarbonate was increased
at 35, blood urea nitrogen was 34, creatinine was 7.2, and
blood glucose was 111.  Arterial blood gas initially revealed
pH was 7.56, PCO2 was 38, and PO2 was 38.  Arterial blood gas
then improved to a pH of 7.42, PCO2 of 43, and PO2 of 62;
this was on 100% nonrebreather mask.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray from [**6-25**]
showed bulky lymphadenopathy with diffuse reticular nodular
pattern and bilateral pleural effusions; consistent with
congestive heart failure and metastatic disease.

Electrocardiogram was compared with [**3271-12-14**] with a
rate of 75, normal sinus, left axis deviation, and normal
intervals.  Left ventricular hypertrophy with a flipped T
wave in leads V4, V5, and III (which were new).

Just noting a computed tomography scan from [**6-22**], prior to
admission, showed extensive mediastinal adenopathy with a
node as large as 3.3 cm X 2.9 cm (which has increased in
size).  Also, small bilateral pleural effusions.  Also with
new nodular densities and an increased size of metastases in
the left lobe with one nodule measuring 12 mm in diameter.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  HYPOXIA ISSUES:  The patient was admitted with hypoxia
with an oxygen requirement, but his saturations improved on
100% nonrebreather mask to the 90s.  He was breathing
comfortably.  It seemed that the patient encountered sputum
that he could not clear.  His saturations dropped, but when
he coughed his saturations would improve.

Of note, the patient came to the Intensive Care Unit on a
nitroglycerin drip and had been taking isosorbide
mononitrate, and this may have worsened his respiratory
status as it may have dilated pulmonary vasculature that was
contracting to try and keep his V/Q match.  Also, the patient
had been anorexic over the past several weeks and had
probably lost wean by mask, though his dialysis was being
maintained at the same dry weight.  When the patient was
dialyzed off 3 liters later in the morning on the day of
admission, the patient's respiratory status improved.  The
patient will most likely require establishment of a new lower
dry weight.

There was an immediate suspicion for a pulmonary embolism on
admission; however, given the patient's metastatic status,
history of bleeds, and improving oxygen saturations, the
patient was not fully heparinized at that time.  However, on
day two of admission the patient was sent for a computed
tomography angiogram to rule out a pulmonary embolism.

In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient continued to
improve his oxygenation and was switched to 6 liters nasal
cannula and was breathing comfortably.

2.  METABOLIC ALKALOSIS ISSUES:  The patient was admitted
with a bicarbonate of 35.  This may have enhanced his
respiratory distress as the patient is oliguric.  This likely
was an iatrogenic elevated bicarbonate level due to either
over bicarbonated dialysis solution and/or his Phos-Lo and/or
Renagel.  Those two medications were held in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit, and he was dialyzed again with a low
bicarbonate solution, and his bicarbonate resolved down to 27
after that.  It seemed that this may no longer be an issue
for this patient.

3.  HYPERTENSIVE ISSUES:  The patient was hypertensive to
200/80s to 90s on admission to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit.  The patient was initially placed on a labetalol drip
with good affect.  This was after the nitroglycerin drip was
stopped.  The next day we attempted to take the patient off
the labetalol drip and maintain him on his metoprolol 75 mg
p.o. twice per day; however, this was not sufficient
overnight, and the patient was placed on hydralazine 20 mg
intravenously every six hours for blood pressure maintenance
which worked well.

4.  END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was last
dialyzed on [**6-23**].  He was dialyzed again on [**6-26**] with 3
liters removed.  The patient seemed to have an improvement in
his respiratory status after this and had no signs of being
overly dried out by this dialysis.  It was very likely that
due to the patient's recent anorexia he had lost dry weight
and needed to be dialyzed to a lower dry weight.

5.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient had a
distant history of a myocardial infarction.  A recent
echocardiogram from [**3270**] showed a preserved ejection fraction
and left ventricular function.

The patient did have a small troponin leak by enzymes at
approximately 0.2, but his creatine kinase levels were flat
at around 50 to 60.  We had a low suspicion that the patient
had a cardiac event and thought that this was more likely due
to his respiratory distress and his end-stage renal disease.

However, the patient received another echocardiogram with a
bubble study.  This echocardiogram on [**6-26**] showed a small
right-to-left shunt across the atrium, left ventricular
function was preserved and normal size, normal ejection
fraction of greater than 55%, mild aortic regurgitation, and
mild mitral regurgitation.  The patient did have moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  The patient was also
switched from Ticlid to Plavix for an anti-platelet [**Doctor Last Name 614**]
which the patient is presumably on in lieu of aspirin which
he is allergic to.

6.  TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was placed
on an insulin sliding-scale and a diabetic diet with
fingersticks four times per day.

7.  RENAL CELL CARCINOMA ISSUES:  The patient recently
learned that he had metastases to his lungs.  His family and
outpatient oncologist were notified of this situation.

8.  PROPHYLAXIS ISSUES:  The patient was maintained on
subcutaneous heparin and ranitidine for gastrointestinal
prophylaxis.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     Mr. [**Known patient lastname 9229**] is a 79-year-old gentleman who has chronic renal failure and has
     been on long-term hemodialysis.  He has developed two large aneurysms from a
     radiocephalic fistula where multiple dialysis punctures were made.  He enters
     for a diagnostic and possibly interventional study because of clot in the more
     centrally-located aneurysm.  There is excellent arterial flow into the distal
     aneurysm and good pulsatile flow into the distal cephalic vein that enters the
     distal aneurysm.
     
     FISTULOGRAM:  A direct puncture was made.  After the arterial and venous
     anatomy were outlined, a micro-puncture set was used with passage of the guide
     wire and sheath into the distal aneurysm.  Contrast material was then injected
     into the distal aneurysm that was completely filled with clot.  There was a
     small amount of contrast material that passed centrally around the clot.
     
     A complete venous outline was made of the left upper extremity extending into
     the superior vena cava with no evidence of an obstructed lesion more
     centrally.
     
     The micro-puncture catheter was then exchanged over a glide wire and a 6-
     French sheath was inserted.
     
     A Mewissen multi-sidehole pulse spray catheter was then placed in the proximal
     aneurysm with the tip extending into the cephalic vein.  Five milligrams of
     TPA were pulsed into the aneurysmal clot.  The pulse spray catheter was
     removed and a Possis pulse spray clot aspiration  catheter for clot aspiration
     was passed into the aneurysm.  Heparinized saline was used for this maneuver.
     The aneurysm was pulse sprayed on two occasions. Lysis of a large amount of
     clot as well as the clot obstructing the outflow of the more proximal
     aneurysm.
     
     Considerable venous spasm occurred because of the pulse spray technique and
     approximately 200 to 400 micrograms of nitroglycerin were used on two
     occasions.  At the termination of the procedure, a large amount of clot had
     been removed from the more central aneurysm and the spasms in the cephalic
     vein had cleared significantly.  It was decided not to angioplasty the venous
     spasm because of endothelial damage.
                                                                 (Over)

     The inflow to the more distal aneurysm was impaired because of the 6-French
     sheath.
     
     The 6-French sheath was removed and compression was applied for approximately
     10 minutes.  At the termination of the procedure, the pulse had come back in
     the cephalic vein just distal to the more distal aneurysm and there was good
     filling of the distal aneurysm.  However, the aneurysm was not as tense as at
     the beginning because of good outflow.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Status post dialysis fistula intervention with good flow into the
     more peripheral aneurysm.  The patient is scheduled for dialysis this p.m., on
     [**3274-11-7**].
     
     Note at dialysis all of the clot had lysed in the more central aneurysm and
     dialysis was performed without incident. Excellent result.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     Mr. [**Known patient lastname 9229**] is a 79-year-old gentleman who has chronic renal failure and has
     been on long-term hemodialysis.  He has developed two large aneurysms from a
     radiocephalic fistula where multiple dialysis punctures were made.  He enters
     for a diagnostic and possibly interventional study because of clot in the more
     centrally-located aneurysm.  There is excellent arterial flow into the distal
     aneurysm and good pulsatile flow into the distal cephalic vein that enters the
     distal aneurysm.
     
     FISTULOGRAM:  A direct puncture was made.  After the arterial and venous
     anatomy were outlined, a micro-puncture set was used with passage of the guide
     wire and sheath into the distal aneurysm.  Contrast material was then injected
     into the distal aneurysm that was completely filled with clot.  There was a
     small amount of contrast material that passed centrally around the clot.
     
     A complete venous outline was made of the left upper extremity extending into
     the superior vena cava with no evidence of an obstructed lesion more
     centrally.
     
     The micro-puncture catheter was then exchanged over a glide wire and a 6-
     French sheath was inserted.
     
     A Mewissen multi-sidehole pulse spray catheter was then placed in the proximal
     aneurysm with the tip extending into the cephalic vein.  Five milligrams of
     TPA were pulsed into the aneurysmal clot.  The pulse spray catheter was
     removed and a Possis pulse spray clot aspiration  catheter for clot aspiration
     was passed into the aneurysm.  Heparinized saline was used for this maneuver.
     The aneurysm was pulse sprayed on two occasions. Lysis of a large amount of
     clot as well as the clot obstructing the outflow of the more proximal
     aneurysm.
     
     Considerable venous spasm occurred because of the pulse spray technique and
     approximately 200 to 400 micrograms of nitroglycerin were used on two
     occasions.  At the termination of the procedure, a large amount of clot had
     been removed from the more central aneurysm and the spasms in the cephalic
     vein had cleared significantly.  It was decided not to angioplasty the venous
     spasm because of endothelial damage.
                                                                 (Over)

     The inflow to the more distal aneurysm was impaired because of the 6-French
     sheath.
     
     The 6-French sheath was removed and compression was applied for approximately
     10 minutes.  At the termination of the procedure, the pulse had come back in
     the cephalic vein just distal to the more distal aneurysm and there was good
     filling of the distal aneurysm.  However, the aneurysm was not as tense as at
     the beginning because of good outflow.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Status post dialysis fistula intervention with good flow into the
     more peripheral aneurysm.  The patient is scheduled for dialysis this p.m., on
     [**3274-11-7**].
     
     Note at dialysis all of the clot had lysed in the more central aneurysm and
     dialysis was performed without incident. Excellent result.

     INDICATION: Renal cell carcinoma, lung metastases and lymphangitic spread of
     tumor. Evaluate for pulmonary embolism.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Axial images of the chest were acquired helically from the lung
     bases to the lung apices, before and after administration of 100 cc of Optiray
     contrast.  Nonionic contrast was used secondary to the rapid bolus injection
     rate required for CT pulmonary angiography.  There were no adverse reactions
     to contrast administration. Multiplanar reformations were made.
     
     COMPARISON: [**3274-9-14**].
     
     CTA CHEST: The pulmonary vasculature is well opacified and demonstrates no
     intraluminal filling defects suggestive of pulmonary embolus.  Again
     identified is massive mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and prominent hilar
     adenopathy, which compresses the lingular pulmonary arterial branches. Again
     seen are extensive confluent perihilar opacities consistent with the patient's
     known lymphangitic tumor spread. There has been interval progression of the
     opacities since the prior study. The right pleural effusion is stable in size
     to slightly smaller.  The left effusion is significantly larger, with
     extensive compressive atelectasis of the left lower lobe.  There is a new
     17 mm pulmonary nodule in the lingula.  There is a new 5 mm endobronchial
     lesion in the right mainstem bronchus immediately beneath the carina.  A
     smaller nodular opacity is seen in the posterior left mainstem bronchus wall.
     Osseous structures are unchanged, again showing diffuse degenerative changes
     in the spine.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Multiplanar reformatations show no evidence of pulmonary
     embolism.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
     
     2) Extensive perihilar opacities, mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, and
     bilateral pleural effusions. There is worsening lymphangitic spread of tumor
     and a new 17 mm lingular nodule.
