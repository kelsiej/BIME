                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman status post intubation for ET tube placement.
     
     CHEST, PORTABLE AP:  There are no prior studies available for comparison.
     There is an endotracheal tube placed beyond the thoracic inlet at about 6 cm
     above the carina.  A nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and its inferior
     most edge is not clearly seen.
     
     Allowing for technique, the mediastinal and hilar contours are probably
     normal.  Even allowing for technique, the heart is enlarged.  There is some
     lingular scarring or atelectasis.  There are no definite pleural effusions or
     pneumothorax. There is probably mild pulmonary venous congestion.

Addendum:
Agree with Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 11564**] d/c summary as written, but would add the 
following corrections:

Ms. [**Known patient lastname 11565**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo woman who was admitted to the neurology 
service with an acute left MCA stroke leaving her with a right 
hemiparesis and global aphasia.  Etiology of her stroke appears 
to be cardioembolic from Afib in the setting of discontinuation 
of coumadin for a GU procedure.  Because of the risk of bleeding 
at this point (from PEG, GU, and hemorrhagic transformation) we 
will NOT start coumadin yet.  Instead, she should be on a full 
dose aspirin for secondary prevention.  In three to four weeks, 
she should start coumadin.

      Lack of grey/white differtiation and swelling in Sylvian region on left, c/w
      MCA territory infarct. Also, suggestion of possible left MCA occlusion. No
      intracranial hemorrhage.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT *ABNORMAL!
     INDICATIONS:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with question of stroke.
     
     COMPARISONS:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no intra or extra-axial hemorrhage.  There is no mass
     effect, hydrocephalus or shift of the normally midline structures.  There is
     loss of [**Doctor Last Name 30**]-white matter differentiation in the entire left sylvian region
     and in the more posterior parts of the middle cerebral artery distribution.
     There may be slight sparing of preservation of [**Doctor Last Name 30**]-white matter
     differentiation in the most anterior part of the sylvian fissure and left
     frontal lobe, but otherwise much of the left middle cerebral artery territory
     appears involved with acute infarction.  Also, there is abrupt tapering of the
     left middle cerebral artery, and although there is a possible small branch
     extending distally, the appearance and asymmetry with respect to the right
     suggests a left MCA occlusion.
     
     The ventricles, cisterns and sulci wire prominent consistent with atrophy.
     There is loss of the sulcal pattern in posterior part of the left middle
     cerebral artery distribution, also consistent with infarction.
     
     The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear, and these osseous
     structures and soft tissues are otherwise unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Left middle cerebral artery territory acute infarction, which is
     quite extensive, with suggestion of a left middle cerebral artery occlusion.
     The results were immediately relayed to the ED dashboard at the time of the
     interpretation and discussed with the attending physician in the emergency
     room.

     HISTORY:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with history of left MCA stroke, needs GJ tube
     for nutrition.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:
     
     The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3349**] [**Name (STitle) 3350**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6**] with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 6**], attending radiologist, present and supervising throughout.  A written
     informed consent was from the patient's healthcare proxy.
     
     The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table.  The abdomen was
     prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.  A preprocedure timeout was
     performed.  The skin and subcutaneous tissues at the designated insertion site
     were infiltrated with 1% lidocaine.  Air was insufflated through the
     nasogastric tube into the stomach.  A 19-gauge puncture needle was then
     inserted in the stomach, while a T-fastener was attached.  Contrast was
     injected into the stomach through the needle to confirm good location.  The
     T-fastener was deployed.  One additional T-fastener was deployed in a similar
     manner adjacent to the previously deployed T-fastener.  The skin was then
     incised between the two T-fasteners and a 19-gauge needle was then inserted
     into the stomach.  Contrast was again injected through the needle to confirm
     appropriate positioning.  A 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 223**] wire was advanced through the
     stomach beyond the pylorus into the proximal duodenum.  The puncture needle
     was then exchanged for a 5-French sheath with inner dilator.  The inner
     dilator was removed, and a 5-French straight catheter was advanced through the
     sheath and in conjunction with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 223**] wire guide through the duodenum.  The
     [**Last Name (un) 223**] wire was then removed and exchanged for 0.035 Amplatz wire.  Using the
     Amplatz wire, the proximal jejunum was accessed beyond the ligament of Treitz.
     The 5-French catheter and sheath were then removed.  The tract was dilated
     sequentially with 12 and 14-French dilators.  A peel-away sheath was then
     applied over the Amplatz wire.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, a 14-French
     [**Doctor Last Name 936**] GJ catheter was advanced over the Amplatz wire into the proximal
     jejunum.  The peel-away sheath was then removed.  A pigtail was formed within
     the proximal duodenum.  The catheter was secured to the skin using StatLock
     and 0 silk sutures, and covered with dry sterile dressing.  Final fluoroscopic
     film after hand injection of contrast confirmed the appropriate position of
     the tube within the proximal jejunum.

     INDICATION:  Status post percutaneous GJ-tube placement with abdominal pain
     and guarding in left lower quadrant.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained after
     the administration of water-soluble oral and IV contrast.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is dependent atelectasis
     bilaterally.  There is a nonspecific nodular density measuring 4 mm at the
     right lung base (series 2, image 4).
          Multiple small foci of free air anterior to the liver are identified. A
     percutaneous GJ- tube is demonstrated entering the abdomen close to the
     midline and demonstrated taking a turn in the stomach and traversing through
     the duodenum into proximal jejunum.  There are multiple foci of extraluminal
     air intimately associated with the distal duodenum/proximal jejunum.  There is
     free fluid and stranding in the left anterior pararenal space tracking down
     the left paracolic gutter. No extravasation of oral contrast is identified.
     The stomach and small bowel and large bowel are otherwise grossly
     unremarkable.
          The patient is status post cholecystectomy.  The pancreas has an atrophic
     appearance with a dilated pancreatic duct in the tail region with several
     smaller cystic structures near the dilated duct that may represent small side
     branch dilatation or separate small cysts.  There is slight nodular
     enlargement of the right adrenal gland, incompletely characterized on this
     single phase study. There is a large exophytic cyst at the lower pole of the
     left kidney measuring 5.6 x 6.2 cm. There are multiple bilateral small
     hypodense lesions in both kidneys, too small to characterize, that may
     represent cysts. Multiple small retroperitoneal lymph nodes are demonstrated,
     notably an 8-mm aortocaval node (series 2, image 40).
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a Foley catheter present within
     the bladder.  There is a 4.1 x 4.6 cm right adnexal cyst.  The rectum and
     sigmoid colon are filled with air, stool, and contrast.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate degenerative disease of the spine with a scoliotic
     curvature with no suspicious lytic or sclerotic foci.
     
     MULTIPLANAR REFORMATTED IMAGES:  The coronal and sagittal reformatted images

     were essential in determining the location of the extraluminal air and
     demonstrating the intra-abdominal anatomy.  MPR value 4.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Nonspecific 4-mm nodular opacity at the right lung base.
     2)  Multiple foci of intra-abdominal free air located anterior to the liver
     and other multiple foci of extraluminal air near the distal duodenum/proximal
     jejunum with stranding and free fluid present in the anterior pararenal space
     and left paracolic gutter.  Although no extravasated oral contrast is
     identified, this constellation of findings in this patient status post recent
     GJ- tube placement is worrisome for perforated viscus.  The presence of
     stranding in the left anterior pararenal space near the pancreas also raises
     the possibility of pancreatitis. Correlation with laboratory values is
     recommended.  The findings worrisome for perforated viscus were relayed by Dr.
     [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 58**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 59**] to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6991**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6992**] at approximately 7:30 on [**2924-7-19**] and later
     discussed with the covering surgical house staff.
     3)  Dilated pancreatic duct in the tail region of the pancreas with several
     smaller adjacent cystic lesions that may represent separate small cysts or
     dilated side branches.

     INDICATION:  Status post percutaneous GJ-tube placement with abdominal pain
     and guarding in left lower quadrant.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained after
     the administration of water-soluble oral and IV contrast.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is dependent atelectasis
     bilaterally.  There is a nonspecific nodular density measuring 4 mm at the
     right lung base (series 2, image 4).
          Multiple small foci of free air anterior to the liver are identified. A
     percutaneous GJ- tube is demonstrated entering the abdomen close to the
     midline and demonstrated taking a turn in the stomach and traversing through
     the duodenum into proximal jejunum.  There are multiple foci of extraluminal
     air intimately associated with the distal duodenum/proximal jejunum.  There is
     free fluid and stranding in the left anterior pararenal space tracking down
     the left paracolic gutter. No extravasation of oral contrast is identified.
     The stomach and small bowel and large bowel are otherwise grossly
     unremarkable.
          The patient is status post cholecystectomy.  The pancreas has an atrophic
     appearance with a dilated pancreatic duct in the tail region with several
     smaller cystic structures near the dilated duct that may represent small side
     branch dilatation or separate small cysts.  There is slight nodular
     enlargement of the right adrenal gland, incompletely characterized on this
     single phase study. There is a large exophytic cyst at the lower pole of the
     left kidney measuring 5.6 x 6.2 cm. There are multiple bilateral small
     hypodense lesions in both kidneys, too small to characterize, that may
     represent cysts. Multiple small retroperitoneal lymph nodes are demonstrated,
     notably an 8-mm aortocaval node (series 2, image 40).
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a Foley catheter present within
     the bladder.  There is a 4.1 x 4.6 cm right adnexal cyst.  The rectum and
     sigmoid colon are filled with air, stool, and contrast.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate degenerative disease of the spine with a scoliotic
     curvature with no suspicious lytic or sclerotic foci.

     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Nonspecific 4-mm nodular opacity at the right lung base.
     2)  Multiple foci of intra-abdominal free air located anterior to the liver
     and other multiple foci of extraluminal air near the distal duodenum/proximal

     and left paracolic gutter.  Although no extravasated oral contrast is
     identified, this constellation of findings in this patient status post recent
     GJ- tube placement is worrisome for perforated viscus.  The presence of
     stranding in the left anterior pararenal space near the pancreas also raises
     the possibility of pancreatitis. Correlation with laboratory values is
     recommended.  The findings worrisome for perforated viscus were relayed by Dr.

     COMPARISON:  CT head dated [**2924-7-11**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the head were obtained without IV contrast.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is a large region of low attenuation in the distribution of
     the left middle cerebral artery in the subcortical white matter, extending to
     the cortex, now more prominent compared to the prior study.  There is slight
     left to right shift, possibly slightly more prominent compared to the prior
     study.  The ventricles are stable in size.  Note is made of calcification in
     the basal ganglia bilaterally, likely age-related.  There is no evidence of
     acute intracranial hemorrhage.  The basilar cisterns are patent.  The
     visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses are well aerated.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Evolving left MCA territory infarction producing slight mass
     effect on the left lateral ventricle and slight left to right shift more
     prominent compared to the prior study.

     tube placement.
     
     ABDOMEN, SUPINE AND LEFT LATERAL DECUBITUS:  Contrast was administered into
     the gastrostomy tube prior to acquisition of these images.  There is no
     evidence of leakage, and contrast passes into the colon.  Appearance of the
     gastrojejunostomy tube is unchanged.  A nasogastric tube passes into the
     distal stomach.  The left lateral decubitus view demonstrates scattered
     air-fluid levels in the small bowel, which is nondistended.  There is
     accordingly no evidence of obstruction, and the appearance is nonspecific, and
     may suggest gastroenteritis.  No free air is seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  No evidence of perforation or obstruction.
     2)  Nonspecific air-fluid levels, possibly gastroenteritis.
