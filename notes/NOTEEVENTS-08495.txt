History of Present Illness:
71M with hx COPD, respiratory failure s/p trach, transferred for 
hypotension, new infiltrate, sepsis. Came from [**Location (un) 3410**] ICU 
with COPD flare when he was trached and peg'd. Pt transferred to 
[**Hospital3 **] for vent weaning and has been off ventilator 
support for the last 3 days. He had his trach downsized to size 
6 and he was speaking with a Passy-Muir valve. Yesterday he had 
a barium swallow. Barium swallow showed severe aspiration with 
pudding, ineffective cough/clearance. No witnessed aspiration 
event. This am pt had respiratory distress (desat) and was 
placed back on the vent, became hypotensive. CVL (R fem) line 
placed and pt started on levophed and dopamine. Received ceftaz,

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 11800**] is a 71M with endstage COPD s/p trach who was 
transferred from [**Hospital 4392**] Rehab with likely aspiration PNA and 
sepsis. He arrived to the FICU in a very tenuous condition while 
on 2 pressors. He was noted to be in hypoxic and hypercarbic 
respiratory failure (hypoxic and hypercarbic), likely secondary 
to endstage COPD coupled with aspiration pneumonia. He was 
initially ventilated on AC mode via his trach. He was also noted 
to be in septic shock and was significantly hypotensive (60/30s) 
on 2 pressors on arrival to FICU. He was started on IVF, stress 
dose steroids, and a 3 pressor regimen with Dopamine, Levophed 
and Vasopressin. His blood pressure stabilized on this regimen. 
.
He was broadly covered with Vanc, Ceftazidime and Clindamycin at 
the rehab. In the FICU he was transitioned to Zosyn, Levoflox 
and Vanc. and maintained on a sepsis protocol. He was given 
Albuterol MDI, Atrovent MDI and Flovent for COPD exacerbation. 
His sputum cultures were significant for Ecoli (S to Zosyn) and 
P. aeruginosa. His Levoflox and Vanc were discontinued.   
.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 11800**] has a gradual improvement in his ventilation status 
status during the hospitalization. He was noted to have an 
APACHE score of >25 for which he was started on 96h of Xigris. 
His sedation was eventually weaned off and his blood gases 
improved.  His blood pressure remained stable off of pressors.  
He did become hypernatremic with a sodium which peaked at 150.  
This resolved with the addition of free water boluses to his 
tube feedings. 
.
Transitioned to PS vent. Pressors weaned off o/n b/w [**6-10**]- [**6-11**]. 
Had a trach mask trial on [**6-11**], which he failed.  He was noted to 
be sig vol overloaded but he started autodiuresing as his vent 
settings were weaned down.  His respiratory status improved and 
he tolerated longer and longer periods on the trach mask.  His 
antibiotics were converted to Zosyn 4.5g IV q8 once his blood 
and sputum cultures grew sensitive E.Coli.  Due to his 
bacteremia, he was to continue a course of 14 days for his 
aspiration PNA with E.coli bacteremia (day#11 on discharge - 
last dose [**3236-6-19**]).  Prior to discharge, patient was able to 
complete wean from the vent and remained on a 50% trach mask. 
. 
Patient was transferred to his prior rehab hospital to continue 
with trach management as well as to complete a 2 week course of 
ABx.  Pt is to remain on tube feedings as he represents a 
permanent swallow risk as evaluated by S&S.

     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     FINDINGS:  The tracheostomy tube is present with the tip terminating at the
     level of the thoracic inlet.  There is diffuse severe consolidation involving

     vascular markings in the right lung suggest background emphysema.  No
     pneumothorax is present.  The costophrenic sulci are not fully seen.  Slight
     fullness in the left hilus is noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Severe diffuse left sided consolidation, most consistent with presumed
     aspiration pneumonia.
     2)  Emphysema.
     3)  Fullness of the left hilum, possibly superimposed adenopathy. Continued
     follow up after therapy is recommended.

As Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] feels hypotension may in part be r/t auto-peep.

Lytes repleated as ordered.  LIJ pre-sep cath placed and MUST protocol started.  Lactate has been stable ~1.4.  T-max 99.3.  ABG 7.28/63/57/31.  UOP 150-250/hr.  CVP 12-13.  HR 90's to 1teens.  SR-ST.  PEG in place.  R fem line to be D/C'd.  ?cx needed of tip.

Pt is now more alert, mouthing words and following commands.  Denies pain and MAE.  Many family and friends present.  In to visit [**2-8**] at a time.  Wife and children updated on pt status by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

Update 1730
Consent for FFP obtained from wife by team.  3units FFP given as ordered.  CVP to 19.  BP remains stable.  

Xigris started at 1600.  DOSED BY PHARMACY ACCORDING TO DRY WEIGHT OF 66.1KG THOUGH WEIGHT ON ADMISSION 80.5KG.  WEIGHT CHANGED IN ADT CENSUS AT 1600 AT START OF XIGRIS INFUSION.  LEVOPHED DOSE IN CAREVIEW REFLECTS THIS CHANGE.  LEVO WAS TITRATED DOWN FROM 28ML TO 22ML/HR AT THIS TIME.

Repeat ABG sent 7.29/45/146/23, repeat specimen sent and PaO2 confirmed.  FiO2 decreased by RT to 50%.  Lactate 3.2  Team aware.

Pt remained supine t/o shift r/t hemodynamic instability including severe hypotension w/ mouthcare in am, though has been more hemodynamically stable this afternoon.  Positioned on R side at 1700 and tolerated position change well.

Plan:  Continue to titrate and wean pressors as able.  Continue current level of sedation. Per pharmacy it is important that xigris run without interuption.  Each bag lasts ~6hr.  Must notify pharmacy 2hr prior to next bag.  Monitor CBC as ordered and monitor for s/s bleeding r/t xigris.

     CHEST SINGLE VIEW ON [**6-8**].
     
     HISTORY:  COPD and asthma with likely aspiration pneumonia.  Check ET tube.
     
     FINDINGS:  These are two frontal semierect films of the chest.  Despite a
     repeated film, the extreme left lateral chest is off the film.  There is dense
     left lower lobe opacification consistent with volume loss/effusion/infiltrate.
     There is also a more hazy alveolar infiltrate that is more prominent in the
     lower than upper lobes on the left.  The right lung is clear with a small
     right effusion.  Compared to the film from the prior day, there has been no
     significant change.  The tracheostomy tube tip is at the thoracic inlet.  The
     left subclavian line tip is in the distal SVC.

     COMPARISON:  [**3236-6-10**].
     
     FINDINGS:  A right-sided PICC line has been placed with the tip terminating in
     the region of the right brachiocephalic vein.  A tracheostomy tube, left
     subclavian catheter, and G-tube are unchanged.  Left lung consolidation and
     pleural effusion persist.  There is again note of background emphysematous
     changes.  Prominence of pulmonary vascularity likely reflects superimposed
     failure, which is also unchanged.
