     HISTORY:  Fifty-seven year old man with renal cell cancer, r/o metastases.
      
     INTERPRETATION:  Whole body views of the skeleton show several foci of  
     abnormally increased activity within the right posterior ribs, unchanged since
     the previous exam and consistent with the patient's surgical history.  Foci of
     increased activity in the left shoulder is also stable and consistent with
     degenerative change.  There is no increased activity to suggest metastatic
     disease.
      
     There has been right nephrectomy.  The left kidney and urinary bladder are
     visualized, the normal route of tracer excretion.
      
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of metastatic disease.  No change from [**3483-7-25**]. /nkg

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58-year-old male with
metastatic renal cell carcinoma who is four years past right
radical nephrectomy Stage T3B.  The patient subsequently in
[**3480-9-4**], had two lesions resected from the left
posterior lung lobe consistent also with metastatic renal
cell carcinoma.  He has been followed with serial
surveillance CT scans.  He had a scan from [**3483-11-19**]
which showed a lesion in his solitary left kidney
approximately 2 cm in diameter.  Patient had no hematuria, no
abdominal pain, no nausea or vomiting, no weight loss, no
fever or chills.  He had a bone scan done on [**3483-11-28**]
which showed no metastatic disease and his BUN and creatinine
at that time were 18 and 1.1.  He presented for evaluation of
the left renal mass and was scheduled for a left partial
nephrectomy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Right nephrectomy with IVC
thrombectomy in [**3479**], left lung resection in [**3480**].

MEDICATIONS:  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 po q.d., Norvasc 10 mg
po q.d., Zestril 20 mg po q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient drinks three to four glasses of wine
per night.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initial physical examination, the
patient is a well-developed, well-appearing male in no
apparent distress.  His neck was supple, no masses.  His
chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:
Regular rate and rhythm.  His abdomen contained no palpable
masses.  Liver and spleen were within normal limits.  No
hernias were found.  He had no palpable lymphadenopathy.  His
anus and perineum were within normal limits.  His
genitourinary exam was normal.  His prostate was
approximately 40 grams.  He was neurologically intact.

LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count was 7.2, hematocrit
39.6, platelets 242,000.  Urinalysis was negative.  His PT
was 13, PTT 22.9, INR 1.2.  His sodium was 138, potassium
4.3, chloride 99, C02 24, BUN 15, creatinine 1.0.  AST and
ALT were 28 and 27 respectively.  Alkaline phosphatase was
40.  His total bilirubin .7.  Albumin 4.4.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 607**] was admitted on [**3483-12-21**].  He underwent a left partial nephrectomy under
general endotracheal anesthesia.  Intraoperative, he had
significant blood loss of approximately two liters for which
he received 1200 cc of crystalloid.  He had a number one JP
drain and a Foley catheter placed.  There were no
complications.  He was transported to the Recovery Room
intubated and in stable condition, however, he was requiring
pressors to keep his pressure up.  His initial blood gases in
the Post Anesthesia Care Unit were 7.28, 42, 149, 21 with a
base excess of 6.  Based on this and his pressor requirement,
he was kept intubated and transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit.  Overnight, he was weaned off of his pressor and weaned
off of the ventilator.  He was extubated on postoperative day
number one without incident and transferred to the regular
floor.  Patient had received three units of blood
intraoperatively and one unit in the Post Anesthesia Care
Unit.  On postoperative day one, his hematocrit was 27.7,
however, on postoperative day number three, it progressively
decreased to 22, 23.5 on repeat.  02 was given, one unit of
packed red blood cells, hematocrit increased to 24 and was
25.8 on discharge.  He was kept on Ancef perioperatively. He
remained afebrile throughout his hospital course.  He was not
discharged on any antibiotics. His urine output remained good
throughout his hospital course and his BUN and creatinine
were 18 and 1.3.  His diet was advanced on postoperative day
number five, he was ambulating independently and tolerating a
regular diet and his pain was controlled on oral pain
medication.  He initially had some high output from his JP
drain about 600 cc per day.  JP creatinine was checked which
was 2 and his drain was taken out on postoperative day number
six.

CONDITION OF DISCHARGE:  Patient is afebrile, hemodynamically
stable, tolerating a regular diet, ambulating independently,
tolerating oral pain medication.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Renal cell carcinoma. Clear cells variant.
2.  Status post left partial nephrectomy, a solitary kidney.
3.  Hypertension.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Dilaudid 2-4 mg po q. 4 hours prn pain.
2.  Colace 100 mg po b.i.d.
3.  Iron sulfate 325 mg po t.i.d.

     CT OF THE TORSO, [**3484-4-14**]:
     
     INDICATION:  Renal cell cancer.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired axial images were obtained from the thoracic
     inlet through the symphysis pubis without IV contrast.  IV contrast was not
     given at the request of the ordering clinician.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3483-11-19**].
     
     CT OF THE TORSO W/O CONTRAST:  There are a few small mediastinal lymph nodes
     present, one of which has a fatty hilum in the right paratracheal region.  No
     pleural or pericardial effusions are seen.  The heart size is normal.
     
     There has been interval increase in size of two lung nodules, one in the left
     upper lobe measures 14 X 19 mm, and the second one at the right lung base
     measures approximately 4.5 mm.  Both are slightly increased since the previous
     examination.  No new lung nodules are identified.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST:  The unenhanced liver, spleen, adrenal glands,
     and pancreas are unremarkable.  Numerous clips are seen in the region of the
     right renal fossa.  Again seen is a relatively low attenuation mass at the mid
     to lower pole of the left kidney which is also increased in size since the
     previous examination.  Small periportal lymph nodes are seen, not
     significantly changed.  There is no ascites.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS W/IV CONTRAST:  The small and large bowel loops are normal
     without evidence to suggest obstruction.  There is a fat-containing left
     inguinal hernia.
     
     No sclerotic or lytic lesions are seen on bone windows.  Degenerative changes
     are noted within the right shoulder, likely due to previous trauma especially
     in light of healed rib fractures on the right.

     renal mass.  See below oncology summary for detailed measurements.

     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2 weighted images of the kidneys was performed
     including T1 weighted axial in and out of phase, coronal HASTE, dynamic pre
     and post Gadolinium enhanced axial/coronal VIBE and sagittal fat saturated T1
     weighted images were performed.  Multiplanar reformatted images were done and
     analyzed on the workstation.
     
     MR ABDOMEN:  The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and adrenals are
     normal. The patient is post right nephrectomy. There are no abnormal soft
     tissue lesions in the nephrectomy bed.  There is no adenopathy in the
     visualized abdomen.
     
     The lesion in the lower aspect of the left kidney measures 25 x 25 x 31 mm
     (progressive growth viewing multiple prior X-sectional studies) and has a
     thick enhancing nodular rim with a necrotic center. There is a second
     enhancing 12 mm lesion in the medial aspect of the upper pole of the left
     kidney. Scattered subcentimeter simple renal cysts are also present. There is
     no hydronephrosis. There is no renal vein invasion.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Fifty-eight year old with renal cell cancer.  Review of the medical  
     records reveal that the patient is s/p right nephrectomy.  A recent MRI
     examination of the remaining left kidney reveals an abnormally enhancing lesion 
     in the lower aspect of the left kidney and the medial aspect of the upper poles
     of the left kidney.
      
     INTERPRETATION:  Whole body views of the skeleton show a focus of abnormally
     increased tracer activity in the lower pole of the left kidney.  No other
     abnormal foci of tracer activity is identified.
      
     The left kidney is enlarged and this may represent hypertrophic changes
     secondary to the surgical removal of the right kidney.  The urinary bladder is
     visualized, the normal route of tracer excretion. 
      
     Compared with the prior bone scan of [**3483-11-28**], the overall size of the left
     kidney is not significantly changed but the abnormal focus of uptake in the
     lower pole is a new finding.
      
     Correlating this finding with the results of a recent MRI examination of the
     abdomen dated [**3484-4-18**], the enhancing lesion in the lower pole of the left kidney
     on that exam has a non-enhancing T2 bright focus centrally.  This may represent
     a trapped calyx within this mass which has increased uptake on the bone scan.
      
     IMPRESSION:  1) No bone scan evidence of metastatic disease.  2) A new abnormal
     focus of increased uptake in the lower pole of the left kidney, correlation with
     the MRI examination reveals a possibility that this represents trapped calyx
     within the mass of the lower pole of the left kidney. /nkg

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  58 year old man with renal cell cancer, presents with syncope.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MR of the head without and with contrast.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Comparison is made with prior CT of the head performed [**3484-5-25**]
     and MR of the head performed [**3484-5-3**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2W images were obtained through the brain pre
     and post administration of 10 cc of Gadolinium.
     
     FINDINGS:  There are no abnormal intra or extra-axial fluid collections. There
     is no mass effect or shift of the normally midline structures.
     
     Within both cerebellar hemispheres and within the right middle cerebellar
     peduncle are areas of increased T2 and FLAIR signal intensity, some of which
     demonstrate mild enhancement.  No mass effect is noted associated with these
     lesions.
     
     Scattered small foci of increased T2 and FLAIR signal are also noted within
     the periventricular white matter.  Although these foci are nonspecific they
     may represent foci of chronic microvascular infarctions or mild post
     inflammatory change.  Normal vascular flow patterns are preserved.
     
     The orbits, visualized paranasal sinuses and visualized soft tissues are
     unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Abnormal areas of T2 and FLAIR signal within both cerebral
     hemispheres and within the right middle cerebellar peduncle, some of which
     demonstrate mild enhancement, likely represent infarcts, however follow up is
     recommended to exclude malignant process.  No significant mass effect is
     associated with these lesions.

     MRI OF THE BRAIN WITH MRA OF THE NECK AND CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **].
     
     INDICATION:  ?Infarct in the cerebellum and rule out vascular occlusion.
     
     Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images of the brain were performed. Diffusion-
     weighted images are obtained.  2D and 3D time-of-flight MRA of the
     extracranial circulation and 3D time-of-flight MRI of the intracranial
     circulation were performed.
     
     Correlation is made to the prior exam of [**3484-5-25**].
     
     Diffusion-weighted images reveal small areas of scattered restricted diffusion
     within the left inferior cerebellar hemisphere, the right cerebellar
     hemisphere and the right middle cerebellar peduncle suspicious for small
     subacute infarcts.  It should be noted that areas of vasogenic edema might
     present with similar restricted diffusion and should be considered, especially
     in view of the history of renal cancer.  These areas demonstrate abnormal
     increased T2 signal intensity, as mentioned and demonstrated previously.
     
     Smaller foci of T2 hyperintensity are seen within the periventricular white
     matter.  There is no midline shift or mass effect.  Ventricular system is
     symmetrical.
     
     MRA of the extracranial circulation reveals no hemodynamically significant
     stenosis involving either carotid bifurcation.  There is absence of signal
     related enhancement within the left vertebral artery suggestive of total
     occlusion at its origin.  The right vertebrobasilar system is patent.
     
     MRA of the intracranial circulation reveals focal stenosis involving the
     origin of the left posterior cerebral artery.  Intracranially, there is severe
     85-90% stenosis involving the precavernous portion of the left internal
     carotid artery.  Minor atheromatous changes are seen involving both carotid
     siphons.  There is mild disease involving the supraclinoid portion of the
     right internal carotid artery, estimated at around 40-50%.  The middle
     cerebral artery trifurcations are patent.

     1) Several foci of restricted diffusion within the cerebellar hemispheres
     highly suspicious for small subacute infarcts, mostly embolic in nature. It
     should be noted that areas of vasogenic edema related to metastatis could also
     result in significant restriction of diffusion.This is less likely.

     related enhancement within the left vertebral artery suggestive of total
     occlusion at its origin.  The right vertebrobasilar system is patent.
     
     MRA of the intracranial circulation reveals focal stenosis involving the
     origin of the left posterior cerebral artery.  Intracranially, there is severe
     85-90% stenosis involving the precavernous portion of the left internal
     carotid artery.  Minor atheromatous changes are seen involving both carotid
     siphons.  There is mild disease involving the supraclinoid portion of the
     right internal carotid artery, estimated at around 40-50%.  The middle
     cerebral artery trifurcations are patent.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Several foci of restricted diffusion within the cerebellar hemispheres
     highly suspicious for small subacute infarcts, mostly embolic in nature. It
     should be noted that areas of vasogenic edema related to metastatis could also
     result in significant restriction of diffusion.This is less likely.
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     INDICATION:  Metastatic renal carcinoma.  Previously identified cerebellar
     lesions on MR of [**3484-5-25**].  Please reevaluate.
     
     Multiplanar T1, T2, FLAIR and susceptability of the brain was performed. In
     addition to post-contrast imaging.
     
     Comparison:  Direct comparison is made to next prior study of [**3484-5-25**].
     
     MR HEAD W&W/0 CONTRAST:  Again identified are regions of T2 and FLAIR signal
     within the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres, as well as in the right middle
     cerebellar peduncle.  The overall appearance has not changed significantly
     since the previous exam.  However, only the abnormal region within the right
     cerebellar hemisphere superiorly currently demonstrates enhancement.  The
     other lesions no longer demonstrate enhancement on the post-contrast imaging.
     No mass effect is noted with these lesions.
     
     Again seen, are multiple tiny foci of increased T2 and FLAIR signal within the
     periventricular white matter, likely representing chronic microvascular
     infarcts.  No large vascular territorial infarcts are seen.  There is no
     hydrocephalus or shift of the normally midline structures.  No extra-axial
     fluid collections are seen.  There are normal vascular flow patterns seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent evolving infarcts within the cerebellar
     hemispheres and right middle cerebellar peduncle.  No evidence of metastatic
     disease.

     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis without the administration of
     intravenous contrast per request of the referring physician.
     
     CT CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are
     normal.  There is no change in the appearance of the pretracheal fat-
     containing lymph node which is not pathologically enlarged by CT criteria.
     There is no new hilar, mediastinal, or axillary lymphadenopathy.  The
     pulmonary nodule in the left upper lobe previously measured 14 x 19 mm and now
     measures 10 x 15 mm.  The small rounded nodule in the right lower lobe
     previously measured 5 mm and currently measures 6 mm.  No new nodules are
     identified.  There are no pleural effusions.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The liver, spleen, pancreas, gallbladder,
     adrenal glands, and visualized loops of small and large bowel are normal.  The
     patient is status post right nephrectomy and there is no evidence of a mass in
     the nephrectomy bed.  There is redemonstration of a hypodense mass emanating
     from the lower pole of the left kidney which previously measured 33 x 34 mm
     and today measures 30 x 35 mm.  No new renal masses are identified.  A lymph
     node in the periportal region previously measured 8 x 13 mm and today measures
     11 x 19 mm.  No new enlarged lymph nodes are seen.  No free fluid and no free

     COMPARISON:  [**3484-6-23**]
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiple axial images were obtained from the thoracic inlet to the
     pubic symphysis without IV contrast.
     
     CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The heart and paracardium are within normal
     limits.  The great vessels are intact.  There is no hilar, mediastinal or
     hilar lymphadenopathy seen.  Anterior mediastinum is clear.  In the left upper
     lobe there is a pulmonary nodule seen which measures 11 x 17 mm and has not
     changed significantly in size when compared to the prior study done [**3484-6-23**].
      Again noted is a right lower lobe 6 mm nodule and is not changed compared to
     the prior in characteristics or size.  There are no pleural effusions,
     pneumothoraces or pleural thickening seen.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The liver, spleen, pancreas,
     gallbladder, visualized loops of small and large bowel are unremarkable.
     Multiple surgical clips are seen in the right renal fossa.  This is consistent
     with the patient's history of a right nephrectomy.  No abnormal masses are
     seen in this area.  The left and right adrenal glands are present and within
     normal limits.  In the periportal area the previously seen lymph node again
     identified but has decreased in size and now measures 6 x 13 mm which is
     decreased from 14 x 10 mm on the prior study.  The hyperdense mass is seen
     from the lower portion of the left kidney which previously measured 30 x 30 x
     35 mm and has not decreased significantly in size and most likely represented
     post op changes and if indicated can be followed up with ultrasound.  There is
     no free fluid or new lymphadenopathy seen.

     MR OF THE HEAD:
     
     INDICATION:  A history of metastatic renal cell cancer with history of stroke.
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2 imaging was obtained without and then
     following the administration of Gadolinium.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to a prior MR of the head from [**3484-8-18**].  The
     appearance of the brain is unchanged since that time.  There is no mass
     effect, shift of normally midline structures, or hydrocephalus.  The
     previously described bilateral cerebellar infarcts are unchanged.  Multiple
     tiny areas of T2 hyperintensity present bilaterally, again consistent with
     chronic microvascular infarction.  There are no areas of abnormal enhancement.
     There is a small region of susceptibility artifact within the body of the
     corpus callosum on the left side.  This does not show enhancement with
     Gadolinium, and in retrospect was seen on the prior study.  It appears to be
     related to an adjacent blood vessel, and MR angiography is recommended to
     further characterize this finding.
     
     The visualized soft tissues are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of metastatic disease.  Small area of abnormal
     susceptibility within the corpus callosum on the left.  Please see above

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      58 year old man with renal cell cancer, assess disease status. Please list all
      lesions in oncology table
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      patient with history of met rcca. assess disease status. Please list all
      lesion in oncology table

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  History of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.  Follow-up.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired axial images were obtained from the thoracic
     inlet to the pubic symphysis.  Oral contrast was given to the patient.
     Intravenous contrast was not used secondary to patient's history of
     nephrectomy.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3484-8-18**].
     
     CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The heart and pericardium are within
     normal limits.  The pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable.  There is no
     evidence of hilar, mediastinal or axillary lymphadenopathy.  Again noted is a
     dominant pulmonary nodule in the left upper lobe, currently measuring 1.7 x
     2.1 cm, compared to the prior measurement of 1.1 x 1.7 cm.  The previously
     noted right lower lobe nodule demonstrates no significant change from the
     prior exam, and measures 6 mm.  There are no pleural effusions, pneumothoraces
     or focal consolidation noted.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The liver, spleen, pancreas,
     gallbladder, and adrenals are unremarkable.  The visualized small and large
     bowel loops are within normal limits.  Multiple surgical clips are noted in
     the right renal fossa, consistent with prior history of right nephrectomy.
     There is no disease recurrence noted in the right nephrectomy bed.  There has
     been no significant interval change in the previous noted lymph node in the
     periorbital area.  There is minimal fat stranding associated with the left
     kidney.  The left kidney is otherwise unremarkable.  There is no free fluid or
     free air in the abdomen.  No evidence of retroperitoneal or mesenteric
     lymphadenopathy.
     
     CT PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:   The visualized small and large bowel
     loops are normal in course and caliber.  The bladder and prostate are
     unremarkable.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate no evidence of suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
     Again noted is old right rib fracture.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     There has been interval increase in the size of the left upper lobe nodule. No
                                                                 (Over)
