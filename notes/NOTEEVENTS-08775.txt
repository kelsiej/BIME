                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  History of CLL, lymphadenopathy, diverticuli.  Evaluate for
     obstruction or other etiology of lower abdominal pain.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2802-7-14**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained
     with IV contrast.  Multiplanar reformatted images were also displayed.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  No focal consolidations or pleural
     effusions are seen at the visualized lung bases.  Dependent changes noted at
     the bases.  The liver, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and right kidney
     appear unremarkable.  Left kidney again demonstrates a rounded hypodensity,
     possibly representing cyst but incompletely characterized on single phase CT,
     not significantly changed from prior study.  Patient is status post
     cholecystectomy.  Visualized portions of bowel appear unremarkable.  There is
     no evidence of dilated loops of small bowel or air-fluid levels.
     
     Again seen is severe diffuse lymphadenopathy scattered throughout the abdomen
     and pelvis.  Compared to prior study, some of these nodes appear slightly
     smaller.  There is also evidence of decreased attenuation in a number of the
     enlarged lymph nodes suggesting necrosis.  There is no evidence of free air or
     free fluid within the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The rectum, and bladder appear
     unremarkable.  Again noted are diverticuli within the sigmoid colon, however
     there is no evidence of adjacent stranding to suggest acute diverticulitis.
     Again seen are multiple enlarged pelvic and inguinal lymph nodes, slightly
     smaller compared to prior study.  As with the abdominal lymph nodes there is
     evidence of decreased attenuation in several of the lymph nodes consistent
     with necrosis.  There is no evidence of free fluid within the pelvis.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified.
                                                                 (Over)

Heme/Onc clinic with fevers to 101 and a dry cough.  The patient 
reports feeling well after his most recent discharge until the 
day of admission.  He reports waking up in the morning with a 
fever of 101.  He also reports noticing a dry, persistent cough, 
non-productive, which causes him discomfort on deep inspiration 
and expiration.  He claims to have had a smaller cough for some

therapy to enlarged lymph[**MD Number 65**] in the right perauricular site 
in [**2802-6-10**]. On [**2802-6-28**] an inguinal node excisional biopsy 
confirmed CLL and failed to demonstrate transformation. As a 
result he was treated with Cycle 1 CVP on [**2802-7-3**]. He complained

Brief Hospital Course:
69 year old M with CLL d+8 of CEPP, s/p EPOCH regimen and s/p 
recent admission for abdominal pain secondary to ileus, who is 
admitted for febrile neutropenia to 101F and increased dry 
cough.
.
1 Febrile Neutropenia:  Patient was febrile in AM prior to 
admssion.  Moreover, patient had cough, perhaps indicative of 
pulmonary process.  Differential diagnosis included bacterial, 
fungal, viral infection given neutropenia.  Recurrent CLL, 
atelectasis, inflammatory process, as well as drug effect, were 
also possiblities.  CXR did not show any signs of an acute 
process.  Blood cultures were drawn and CMV viral load was 
obtainted.  A urine culture was negative.  He was started on 
Cefipime, acyclovir, and vancomycin, fluconazole, and his 
atovaquone was continued.  He complained of a funny feeling in 
his throat on [**8-10**], and was cultured.  On hospital day 2 he was 
afebrile. CXR on [**8-13**] showed vol overload, but no overt 
infiltrate. Differential diagnosis includes bacterial, fungal, 
viral infection given neutropenia, CLL, atelectasis, 
inflammatory process, as well as drug effect, are also 
possiblities. Cultures all remained negative. CT [**8-14**] showed: 
progression of multiple patchy nodular opacities associated with 
peribronchial thickening and ground-glass opacity predominantly 
in centrilobular distribution, most prominent in right middle 
lobe, involving both upper and lower lobes, worsened compared to 
the prior study, most likely worsening infectious process with 
persistent bilateral axillary, mediastinal, abdominal, and 
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. ID concerned for fungal 
process. Bronchoscopy [**8-16**] showed PCP in BAL despite atovaquone 
prophylaxis, therefore pt. started on bactrim 360mg IV q8, with 
premedication with compazine, anzemet and olanzapine prior to 
dose for h/o projectile vomitting with bactrim. Ambisome, 
cefipime, atovaquone, and vanco were d/c'd [**8-16**]. Patient with 
4-5L O2 demand [**8-20**], also with shaking to 1 unit prbc's, blood 
stopped, sent to lab for transfusion reaction analysis but no 
evidence of reaction. 
.
He was improving with decreasing O2 demand and tried oral 
bactrim [**8-22**] to see if he could complete his course at home 
however he had uncontrolable nausea and vomitted with aspiration 
and desaturation to 50% and was placed on 100% NRB and went to 
98%. ABG showed 7.51/38/76 on 100% NRB. He was transferred to 
the ICU for close observation and support, CXR suggested 
aspiration. He was treated with levofloxacin and flagyl for 1 
week out of concern for aspiration pneumonia but he improved so 
rapidly that it was likely a sterile aspiration. He was not 
intubated and was stable enough to return to the BMT floor on 
[**8-24**]. He was maintained on IV bactrim for 21 days, he was also 
maintained on solumedrol which was slowly tapered. His oxygen 
requirement decreased and he was able to be weaned off O2. He 
ambulated with PT and was noted to desaturate to 86% on room air 
but came back to 91% on his own while ambulating, so will be 
discharged with home oxygen therapy to wear when working with 
PT. He was discharged on dapsone 100mg daily for prophylaxis, 
with 20mg daily prednisone to be tapered by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 611**] as an 
outpatient.
.
2 CLL: At the time of admission he was on CEPP regimen 
treatment.  Blood counts were low.  His Cytoxan was held the day 
of admission.  However, the patient was continued on 
procarbazine per his outpatient medications.  We also continued 
his Prednisone 100mg q Day for 2 days to complete that part of 
the regimen.  His WBC continued to be below 1000.  Once his 
prednisone was completed, he began a taper to prevent adrenal 
insufficiency.  Moreover, his procarbazine was discontinued 
after completion of his regimen due to drug effect.  He was 
treated with G-CSF for 6 days as ANC responded well and he was 
no longer neutropenic. Over [**Date range (1) 12211**] he was noted to have 
rapidly increasing bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. He had a 
portacath placed [**9-4**] for further therapy. He will follow-up 
with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 611**] next week for rituxan.
.
3 Somnolence: On [**8-12**], he had an episode of worsening mental 
status with lethargy, as well as fevers to 102.  Demerol had 
been given for previous shakes, his HR was in the 120s, his BP 
was 160s/100's and he was diaphoretic.  The differential 
included serotonin syndrome, infection, and procarbazine drug 
effect.  Narcan was administered with slight effect.  He was 
still lethargic, and was put on telemetry and fluids. The 
episode was thought to be due to procarbazine, and it was 
discontinued. He continued to have lethargy/somnolence during 
his hospital course. An MRI of the head was performed on [**8-12**] to 
r/o CNS disease to explain somnolence, which was negative. A 
repeat CT with contrast was done 7/22.06, also negative. He was 
restarted on effexor out of concern for depressed mood but 
tapered off again as he may need procarbazine in the future. He 
was started on ritalin twice daily 2.5mg at 0700 and 1300 on 
[**8-30**], increased to [**9-5**] to 5mg twice daily. This was decreased 
to once daily on [**9-6**] as he felt it could be interfering with 
[**Doctor Last Name 314**]. It is recommended that he follow-up with his psychiatrist 
as an outpatient.
.
4 Nausea: During this hospital course nausea was a significant 
issue, primarily attributed to chemo and bactrim therapy. He had 
a head MRI [**8-12**] and a head CT [**8-31**] to look for central pathology 
contributing to nausea which were both negative. He was 
evaluated by GI who felt that mechanical obstruction was not 
likely to be contributing and that there was no indication for 
endoscopy at this time. He also had a speech therapy evaluation 
of swallowing to see if that might be contributing, which was 
notable for coordinated mastication and swallowing. Nausea was 
controlled with compazine, anzemet then zofran, zyprexa, ativa, 
and a three day course of emend.
.
# Anemia:  A possible chemo effect vs suppression from infection 
was considered.  On admission, his Hct was below 25 and he was 
given 1 unit PRBCs with a good response.  His bilirubin was 3.1 
on day 2, possibly due to transfusion, and repeat LFTs were 
drawn. He required occaisional blood transfussions thorughout 
his hospital course with a hct. averaging 27. 
.
# [**Doctor Last Name **] Disordered Breathing: He has a history of [**Doctor Last Name 314**] 
disordered breathing and has been on Bipap in the past but had 
not used his machine for 9 months prior to admission but his 
machine was tried [**8-21**] to improve sats while sleeping with 
minimal improvement prior to aspiration event, but it was not 
continued after this event. He is to follow-up with his 
outpatient [**Doctor Last Name 314**] medicine pulmonologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1866**] for 
assessment and treatment.

     INDICATION:  69-year-old with CLL and febrile neutropenia, also with lethargy.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images of the brain pre- and
     post-IV-contrast including axial FLAIR, gradient-echo, and diffusion-weighted
     sequences.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2801-8-7**].
     
     MRI OF THE BRAIN PRE- AND POST-IV-CONTRAST:  There is a moderate amount of
     motion artifact seen on the post-contrast images.  However, no clear enhancing
     parenchymal lesions are identified.  There is no leptomeningeal enhancement. 
     The ventricles and sulci are normal in size.  Areas of increased T2 and FLAIR
     signal intensity within both centrum semiovale and in the periventricular
     white matter bilaterally are consistent with small vessel ischemic changes and
     unchanged from the prior study.  No structural abnormalities are identified. 
     There is no restricted diffusion.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     Findings of small vessel ischemic changes, unchanged from the prior
     examination.  No new enhancing lesions or evidence of infarction.  Findings

     AP CHEST, 8:35 A.M., [**8-14**].
     
     HISTORY:  CLL.  Altered mental status.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**8-9**] and [**8-12**]:
     
     There is a new large gas collection in the neck projecting over the larynx,
     just to the left of midline.  This could be a huge laryngocele, esophageal
     diverticulum, or gas containing abscess.  It was not present on the chest CT
     performed [**8-11**].  Mild pulmonary edema present on [**8-12**] has resolved. 
     The heart is normal in size.  Pleural thickening along the lateral left costal
     pleural margin is more pronounced than was on previous studies and there may
     be early subpleural consolidation.  If feasible, routine radiographs should be
     obtained to see if there is pneumonia in the left upper lung.
     
     There is no layering pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Tip of the left PIC
     catheter projects over the SVC.  Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1474**] by
     telephone at the time of dictation.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  70-year-old man with CLL, fever, and neutropenia.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial CT images of the chest without intravenous
     contrast [**Doctor Last Name 74**].
     
     COMPARISON:  Chest CT dated [**2802-8-11**].
     
     FINDINGS:  Again note is made of extensive bilateral lymphadenopathy involving
     bilateral axillae and mediastinum, the largest one in the left axilla
     measuring 2 x 1.2 cm, persistent since prior study.  Again note is made of
     small pericardial and pleural effusion, overall unchanged compared to the
     prior study.  Evaluation of vascular structure is somewhat limited on this CT
     scan without contrast.  In the lung windows, note is made of multiple patchy
     opacities predominantly in centrilobular distribution, associated with ground-
     glass opacity and peribronchial thickening, most prominent in right middle
     lobe; however, the opacities are seen in bilateral upper and lower lobes.
     Overall, these parenchymal findings have progressed compared to the prior
     study.  There is no central endobronchial lesion.
     
     In the visualized portion of the upper abdomen, note is made of multiple
     lymphadenopathy along the gastrohepatic ligament as well as in
     retroperitoneum.  The patient is status post cholecystectomy.
     
     There is no suspicious lytic or blastic lesion in skeletal structures.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Progression of multiple patchy nodular opacities associated with
     peribronchial thickening and ground-glass opacity predominantly in
     centrilobular distribution, most prominent in right middle lobe, however,
     involving both upper and lower lobes, worsened compared to the prior study,
     most likely representing worsening infectious process.  Possibilities include
     bacterial and mycoplasma; however, in this patient with CLL, other atypical
     infections should be considered.
     2.  Persistent bilateral axillary, mediastinal, abdominal, and retroperitoneal
     lymphadenopathy.
     3.  Small pericardial and pleural effusion.
     
     The findings were discussed with the referring physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1865**], by

     SINUS CT WITHOUT CONTRAST:  Comparison is made with the prior sinus CT dated
     [**2802-6-3**].  There are small mucus retention cysts in the maxillary
     sinuses. There is mild mucosal thickening in bilateral ethmoid, sphenoid, and
     maxillary sinuses.  Frontal sinus is clear. Mucosal thickening along the
     bilateral ostiomeatal complex are seen.  There is mucosal thickening in left
     nasal cavity as well.  There is no bone erosion.  Fluid has cleared, and the
     degree of mucosal thickening in sinuses has decreased compared to the prior
     study.
     Visualized portions of the mastoids are clear.

     [**Name Initial (PRE) 3444**].
     
     PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Comparison was made with the prior chest
     radiograph dated [**2802-8-14**].  The PICC line from the left arm is terminating
     in the junction of SVC and right atrium.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
     unchanged.  Again note is made of multiple rounded opacities in soft tissue,
     corresponding to lymphadenopathy seen on prior chest CT.  There is marked
     increase of interstitial opacities in bilateral lungs both upper and lower
     lung areas, associated with patchy peripheral opacities, representing
     worsening PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3444**].  There is bilateral pleural effusion.
     
     IMPRESSION:  PICC line as described above.  Marked increase of bilateral
     diffuse interstitial opacities with peripheral patchy opacities, most likely
     representing worsening PCP pneumonia mentioned in the history.  Bilateral
     small pleural effusions.
     
     The referring physician has been informed.

     CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
     
     Compared with one day earlier and allowing for differences in technique, there
     has probably been some improvement in the opacity at the left lung base. Again
     seen are patchy opacities in both lungs, more predominant in the upper and
     mid-zones, which most likely reflect the presence of PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3444**].  Heart is
     not enlarged.  The aorta is unfolded.  There is left subclavian central line
     with tip over distal most SVC, unchanged.

     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images through the chest, abdomen and pelvis were
     obtained following the administration of oral and 100 cc of Optiray contrast.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There has been significant interval growth in
     the size and number of multiple large lymph nodes within the axillae,
     mediastinum and hila.  One left axillary lymph node, as seen on series 2,
     image 22, and currently measures 54 x 27 mm.  This lesion previously measured
     41 x 22 mm.  Several other lymph nodes are ranging from 2-3 cm in size. Within
     the right axilla, there is low density within the center of where the enlarged
     lymph nodes, raising the possibility of necrosis or superimposed infection.
     The low-density portion of this right axillary node is seen on series 2, image
     13, and currently measures 3.1 x 2.9 cm, new from the prior examination. Nodes
     and nodules within the subcutaneous fat of the chest wall have increased in
     size in the interim as well.
     
     There is a right-sided Port-A-Cath in place, with the tip in the SVC.  There
     are small bilateral pleural effusions and a trace pericardial effusion.  There
     has been significant changes in the appearance of lung parenchyma compared to
     [**2802-8-10**].  There are linear and reticular parenchymal opacities and multiple
     new parenchymal nodules, particularly within the right lower lobe.  These new
     nodular opacities within the right lower lobe range in size from approximately
     7-14 mm.  Within the right middle lobe (series 2, image 40), there is one
     lesion that has a cavity appearance, with soft tissue seen layering
     inferiorly.  Bronchiectasis within the lingula and right upper lobe has
     significantly progressed compared to July.  The central airways remain patent.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal
     glands are normal.  The patient is post cholecystectomy.  The stomach, small
     and large bowel loops are within normal limits.  There is no evidence of
     obstruction.  The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete normally.  There
     is a small rounded hypodensity within the left mid kidney that is not fully

     increased in size and number compared to the prior study.  One large lymph
     node of the portahepatus currently measures 38 x 28 mm.  One large left para-
     aortic lymph node at the level of the left renal vessels currently measures 37
     x 20 mm.  Retrocrural lymph nodes have increased in size, with one right
     retrocrural lymph node currently measuring 13 x 9 mm (previously measuring 7 x
     3 mm).  No free fluid in the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, and
     rectum are normal.  There is sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence of
     diverticulitis.  There is no free pelvic fluid.  As seen in other portions of
     the torso, inguinal and pelvic lymphadenopathy has increased in the interim
     since the prior study.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions.
     
     Multiplanar reformatted images were essential in delineating the anatomy and
     pathology in this case.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Interim disease progression, with increased size and number of numerous
     bulky lymph nodes in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  There is new low
     attenuation within a right axillary node, which may represent necrosis or
     superimposed infection.
     2.  Interim progression of lung parenchymal findings, with new and worsened
     reticular and nodular opacities, worsened bronchiectasis within the right
     upper lobe and lingula, and the possible development of a cavity within the
     right middle lobe containing soft tissue.  Though the patient has a history of
     PCP pneumonia recently, the constellation of current findings raises the
     possibility of invasive or semi-invasive aspergillosis.
     3.  No evidence of bowel obstruction or inflammatory pathology associated with
     the bowel to account for the patient's symptoms.
     
     The findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 7274**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13**] on the afternoon of

     increased in size and number compared to the prior study.  One large lymph
     node of the portahepatus currently measures 38 x 28 mm.  One large left para-
     aortic lymph node at the level of the left renal vessels currently measures 37
     x 20 mm.  Retrocrural lymph nodes have increased in size, with one right
     retrocrural lymph node currently measuring 13 x 9 mm (previously measuring 7 x
     3 mm).  No free fluid in the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, and
     rectum are normal.  There is sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence of
     diverticulitis.  There is no free pelvic fluid.  As seen in other portions of
     the torso, inguinal and pelvic lymphadenopathy has increased in the interim
     since the prior study.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions.
     
     Multiplanar reformatted images were essential in delineating the anatomy and
     pathology in this case.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Interim disease progression, with increased size and number of numerous
     bulky lymph nodes in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  There is new low
     attenuation within a right axillary node, which may represent necrosis or
     superimposed infection.
     2.  Interim progression of lung parenchymal findings, with new and worsened
     reticular and nodular opacities, worsened bronchiectasis within the right
     upper lobe and lingula, and the possible development of a cavity within the
     right middle lobe containing soft tissue.  Though the patient has a history of
     PCP pneumonia recently, the constellation of current findings raises the
     possibility of invasive or semi-invasive aspergillosis.
     3.  No evidence of bowel obstruction or inflammatory pathology associated with
     the bowel to account for the patient's symptoms.
     
     The findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 7274**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13**] on the afternoon of

     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images through the chest, abdomen and pelvis were
     obtained following the administration of oral and 100 cc of Optiray contrast.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There has been significant interval growth in
     the size and number of multiple large lymph nodes within the axillae,
     mediastinum and hila.  One left axillary lymph node, as seen on series 2,
     image 22, and currently measures 54 x 27 mm.  This lesion previously measured
     41 x 22 mm.  Several other lymph nodes are ranging from 2-3 cm in size. Within
     the right axilla, there is low density within the center of where the enlarged
     lymph nodes, raising the possibility of necrosis or superimposed infection.
     The low-density portion of this right axillary node is seen on series 2, image
     13, and currently measures 3.1 x 2.9 cm, new from the prior examination. Nodes
     and nodules within the subcutaneous fat of the chest wall have increased in
     size in the interim as well.
     
     There is a right-sided Port-A-Cath in place, with the tip in the SVC.  There
     are small bilateral pleural effusions and a trace pericardial effusion.  There
     has been significant changes in the appearance of lung parenchyma compared to
     [**2802-8-10**].  There are linear and reticular parenchymal opacities and multiple
     new parenchymal nodules, particularly within the right lower lobe.  These new
     nodular opacities within the right lower lobe range in size from approximately
     7-14 mm.  Within the right middle lobe (series 2, image 40), there is one
     lesion that has a cavity appearance, with soft tissue seen layering

     in the apices and left mid lung fields are present.  The heart and mediastinal
     contours are unchanged with paratracheal thickening and enlargement of the AP
     window secondary to known lymphoma.  Many of the nodules described on chest CT
     are identified, but most are not appreciated on this radiograph. There are no
     pleural effusions, but there is likely a small round area of fluid within the
     major fissure, identified on lateral radiograph.  A right Port-A- Cath tip
     overlies the mid SVC.

     STUDY: MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] with and without contrast.
     
     INDICATION:  70-year-old male with CLL with severe back pain.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT torso [**2802-9-24**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1 and T2-weighted lumbar spine images were obtained with
     axial T2-weighted scans through T12 to the sacrum. Post contrast T1 weighted
     imaging was performed in axial and sagittal orientations.
     
     FINDINGS:  Compression of the superior end plate of T12 is identified which
     displays bright marrow signal on STIR imaging implying a new compression
     fracture of the superior end plate of T12.  No abnormal enhancement within the
     vertebral body is noted to suggest metastatic involvement.  The remaining
     regions of the spine display no disc, vertebral, or paraspinal pathology.
     There is no spinal stenosis or spondylolisthesis.  There is no abnormal
     enhancement involving the spine and no evidence of epidural abscess. The
     visualized distal spinal cord, conus medullaris, and cauda equina are
     unremarkable. Abnormally enlarged retroperitoneal nodes are again identified,
     previously noted on CT torso [**2802-9-10**].
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  New compression fracture of the superior end plate of T12 when compared to

     HISTORY:  T12 compression fracture.
     
     Four radiographs of the thoracic spine again demonstrate loss of vertebral
     body height at the T12 level, accounting for 25-50% of the normal vertebral
     body height.  The finding is unchanged in severity when compared to the MRI
     examination of [**2802-11-28**].  No retropulsed fracture fragment is evident. 
     There is no listhesis.  The visualized mediastinal contours are normal.  A
     right-sided central venous catheter is present with its tip in the SVC.  The
     trachea is midline.  Surgical clips project over the right upper quadrant.
     
     IMPRESSION:

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  70-year-old male with CLL, with rising hyperbilirubinemia and
     transaminitis.  Please evaluate for obstruction in gallbladder region.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to right upper quadrant ultrasound from [**2802-11-6**].
     
     The patient is status post cholecystectomy.  The background echogenicity of
     the liver remains normal, but the liver is now notable for multiple focal
     areas of increased echogenicity around tiny hypoechoic areas which appear to
     represent dilated intrahepatic bile ducts.  Alternatively, this appearance
     could represent a nonspecific hepatitis, although the overall echogenicity of
     the liver would be expected to be more hypoechoic, and some degree of hepatic
     edema would be expected as well. The extrahepatic biliary system does not
     appear dilated, and the common bile duct measures 5 mm in greatest diameter.
     No focal intrahepatic lesions are seen. Bulky lymphadenopathy is again noted
     at the porta hepatis, and appears unchanged from prior study.  The main portal
     vein is patent with appropriate antegrade flow.  There is no ascites.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Interval development of intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.  No
     evidence of extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation or focal area of
     obstruction.
     
     2.  Stable bulky porta hepatitis lymphadenopathy.
     
     The above results were called to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2015**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2016**] at 4:15 p.m. on

     COMPARISON:  [**2802-12-3**] and CT from [**2802-11-8**].
     
     PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Again seen is a Port-A-Cath within the
     right subclavian vein, with the tip in the upper SVC.  The cardiac and
     mediastinal contours are stable in appearance. There is prominence of the
     hilar contours bilaterally, which corresponds to the hilar and the mediastinal
     lymphadenopathy seen on prior studies.  The lungs are stable in appearance.
     Scattered areas of interstitial markings are seen bilaterally, which may
     represent areas of atelectasis or scar, and are stable in appearance.  There
     is a faint ill-defined nodular density adjacent to the right hemidiaphragm,
     which likely corresponds to the nodular opacities seen on prior CT scan from
     [**2802-11-8**].  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax are seen.  Soft tissue and
     osseous structures are stable in appearance.

     FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
     sitting upright position and is compared with a previous chest examination of
     [**2802-12-5**].  The right-sided subclavian approach central venous line
     remains in unchanged position.  No pneumothorax is identified.  When

     the earlier described linear as well as faint parenchymal densities including
     the specifically described density in the right lower lung field in
     supradiaphragmatic position.  Only a few linear densities remain in the left-
     sided mid lung field, probably scar formations or thin peripheral atelectases.

     INDICATION:  70-year-old with CLL and new onset low back pain radiating to the
     groin, evaluate for compression fracture or worsening lymphadenopathy.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT torso of [**2802-9-24**].
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images of the abdomen and pelvis with 100 cc of
     nonionic Optiray contrast, but without oral contrast.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a small ovoid focus of nodular
     thickening along the major fissure at the right lung base.  This is difficult
     to compare to prior studies, as there is extensive consolidation in this
     region previously.  Small amount of nonspecific left-sided pleural thickening
     as well.  There are extensive enlarged lymph nodes throughout the abdomen and
     pelvis.  In the abdomen, the largest nodal conglomerates are within the porta
     hepatis measuring up to 4 cm in long axis diameter.  These appear not
     significantly changed from the prior study.  There are innumerable other
     borderline and moderately enlarged lymph nodes throughout the mesentery and
     retroperitoneum.  All of these appear not significantly changed in size and
     number.  Though this is a delayed phase study limiting assessment of the
     abdominal viscera, there are no clear focal lesions within the liver, spleen,
     adrenal glands, stomach, pancreas, or right kidney.  There is a small ill-
     defined lesion at the lateral cortex of the mid-to-lower pole of the left
     kidney which is too small to characterize.  Several nodular cortical bumps
     along the left kidney as well are nonspecific.  No focal fluid collection or
     abscess in the abdomen.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Multiple significantly enlarged nodal
     conglomerates, the largest in the mid deep central mesentery, do not appear
     significantly changed.  The largest nodal groups measure above 4 cm in long
     axis diameter.  There are significantly enlarged lymph nodes in the inguinal
     region, particularly the left inguinal region, with nodes measuring greater
     than 4 cm.  This may account for some of the patient's groin pain.  The
     largest node in the left groin appears to exert some mass effect on the left
     common femoral vein.  There are also massively enlarged iliac chain lymph node
     conglomerates.  These likely also exert some mass effect on the iliac veins.
     Foley catheter in nondistended bladder.  The rectum and sigmoid are

     views, there are mild acute compression fractures involving the superior
     endplates of T12 and L3, which are new compared to the CT torso of [**2802-9-24**].
     There is no significant kyphotic or lordotic angulation nor compromise of the
     cord nor osseous fragments within the thecal sac.  No definite focal
     destructive sclerotic or lytic lesions are seen throughout the axial skeleton.
     
     MULTIPLANAR REFORMATS:  Coronal and sagittal reformats confirm the above
     findings.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Mild acute compression fractures involving T12 and L3.  There is no
     significant malalignment of the spine or compromise of the cord at these
     levels.
     2) Overall stable appearance of the diffuse nodal burden, with the largest
     nodal conglomerates in the inguinal, iliac chain, and deep mesenteric
     distributions.  These findings may be contributing to the patient's groin
     pain, and given their size, are likely exerting mass effect on the adjacent
     common femoral and iliac veins.
     3) 1-cm hypodense lesion in the left kidney, likely a simple cyst, but not
     fully characterized.
     4) Small focus of nodular thickening along the major fissure at the right lung
     base.  Attention to this on future followup studies is recommended.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
       70 year old man with cll with new onset poorly defined low back pain radiating 
      to the groin. h/o thoracic vertebral compression fractures.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      please assess for retroperitoneal obstructing mass, worsening lymphadenopathy 
      vs. possible lumbar compression fracture. 
     No contraindications for IV contrast

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  70-year-old with CLL and new onset low back pain radiating to the
     groin, evaluate for compression fracture or worsening lymphadenopathy.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT torso of [**2802-9-24**].
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images of the abdomen and pelvis with 100 cc of
     nonionic Optiray contrast, but without oral contrast.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a small ovoid focus of nodular
     thickening along the major fissure at the right lung base.  This is difficult
     to compare to prior studies, as there is extensive consolidation in this
     region previously.  Small amount of nonspecific left-sided pleural thickening
     as well.  There are extensive enlarged lymph nodes throughout the abdomen and
     pelvis.  In the abdomen, the largest nodal conglomerates are within the porta
     hepatis measuring up to 4 cm in long axis diameter.  These appear not
     significantly changed from the prior study.  There are innumerable other
     borderline and moderately enlarged lymph nodes throughout the mesentery and
     retroperitoneum.  All of these appear not significantly changed in size and
     number.  Though this is a delayed phase study limiting assessment of the
     abdominal viscera, there are no clear focal lesions within the liver, spleen,
     adrenal glands, stomach, pancreas, or right kidney.  There is a small ill-
     defined lesion at the lateral cortex of the mid-to-lower pole of the left
     kidney which is too small to characterize.  Several nodular cortical bumps
     along the left kidney as well are nonspecific.  No focal fluid collection or
     abscess in the abdomen.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Multiple significantly enlarged nodal
     conglomerates, the largest in the mid deep central mesentery, do not appear
     significantly changed.  The largest nodal groups measure above 4 cm in long
     axis diameter.  There are significantly enlarged lymph nodes in the inguinal
     region, particularly the left inguinal region, with nodes measuring greater
     than 4 cm.  This may account for some of the patient's groin pain.  The
     largest node in the left groin appears to exert some mass effect on the left
     common femoral vein.  There are also massively enlarged iliac chain lymph node
     conglomerates.  These likely also exert some mass effect on the iliac veins.
     Foley catheter in nondistended bladder.  The rectum and sigmoid are
     unremarkable.  There is no focal fluid collection or abscess in the abdomen.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     (Cont)
     views, there are mild acute compression fractures involving the superior
     endplates of T12 and L3, which are new compared to the CT torso of [**2802-9-24**].
     There is no significant kyphotic or lordotic angulation nor compromise of the
     cord nor osseous fragments within the thecal sac.  No definite focal
     destructive sclerotic or lytic lesions are seen throughout the axial skeleton.
     
     MULTIPLANAR REFORMATS:  Coronal and sagittal reformats confirm the above
     findings.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Mild acute compression fractures involving T12 and L3.  There is no
     significant malalignment of the spine or compromise of the cord at these
     levels.
     2) Overall stable appearance of the diffuse nodal burden, with the largest
     nodal conglomerates in the inguinal, iliac chain, and deep mesenteric
     distributions.  These findings may be contributing to the patient's groin
     pain, and given their size, are likely exerting mass effect on the adjacent
     common femoral and iliac veins.
     3) 1-cm hypodense lesion in the left kidney, likely a simple cyst, but not
     fully characterized.
     4) Small focus of nodular thickening along the major fissure at the right lung
     base.  Attention to this on future followup studies is recommended.
