Brief Hospital Course:
Prior to transfer to medicine service:
.
67 year old man who is s/p MVA with resulting traumatic brain 
injury, including: depressed right skull fracture, subarachnoid, 
subdural, and epidural hemorrhage,
and sagittal sinus laceration. He underwent right-sided 
hemicraniectomy, evacuation of hematoma, and dural repair of the 
superior sagittal sinus.
.
His hospital course was complicated by what was thought to be a 
superior saggital
thrombosis, and interval development of fevers without a clear 
microbiological source. He has had a single positive blood 
culture with coag positive staph growing - his CVL was removed 
and has no growth to date. He has had three sputum samples, two 
with MSSA and one with E. Coli, all in the abscence of 
radiographic evidence of pneumonia. A single stool sample is 
negative for c. difficile.
.
He was given empiric perioperative vancomycin and gentamicin x 3 
doses starting on 2/3/7, and then started on vancomycin and 
zosyn from [**Date range (1) 11778**], and nafcillin from [**Date range (1) 11779**], for empiric 
coverage of fevers. He was also on dilantin from [**Date range (1) 11780**] and 
then changed to keppra. 
.
His LFT's and pancreatitic enzymes were noted to be elevated on 
[**12-24**] with his ALT peaking at 258, alk phos at 623, and lipase at 
623, they are all now trending down. He has also had a 
progressive leukocytosis with a peak at 22.6, his differential 
is left-shifted, but there is no eosinophilia. He also had a 
morbiliform rash on his trunk.

After transfer to medicine service:
.
# Fevers. The patient was felt unlikely to have an infectious 
source of his fevers and these were thought more likely to 
represent drug reaction or central fevers. The patient had 
repeat pan-culture (blood, urine and sputum) revealing negative 
blood and urine cultures and sputum growing Staph and E. Coli as 
known prior to transfer. The patient had no signs of infiltrate 
on repeat CXR and therefore his sputum growth was not treated as 
a pathogen. Further antibiotics were held and the patient was 
maintained off of dilantin (as this may represent a component of 
dilantin hypersensitivity syndrome). His fever curve trended 
downward. The patient was afebrile for >48 hours prior to 
discharge.
.
# Transaminitis. The patient was transferred to the medicine 
service with a transaminitis, benign abdominal exam and no signs 
on abdominal imaging (abdominal plain film and ultrasound) of an 
acute process. This was also felt consistent with a drug 
reaction (again possibly dilantin hypersensitivity syndrome). 
Hypotensive shock liver was considered, though the patient did 
not have a prolonged hypotensive episode. The patient was 
maintained off of antibiotics and dilantin. His liver enzymes 
continue to trend toward normal.
.
# Pancreatitis. Likely chemical pancreatitis secondary to 
numerous acute issues and/or drug reaction. The patient had a 
benign abdominal exam and benign abdominal imaging as described 
above. The patient was maintained off of possible inciting drugs 
and his pancreatic enzymes are trending toward normal.
.
# Traumatic brain injury with bleeding complications. Patient 
with a question of mental status changes on the day of transfer. 
Head CT revealed no interval change. The patient's earlier 
diagnosis of saggital sinus thrombosis was called into question 
as the saggital sinus was found to opacify with dye with 
extrinic compression causing luminal irregularity. The patient's 
IV heparin was discontinued. He received intensive tracheostomy 
care. He was continued in a helmet for when out of bed. The 
patient was continued on valproic acid for seizure prophylaxis 
and underwent an EEG which showed encephalopathy but no active 
seizure activity. His mental status and neuro exam was monitored 
and unchanged throughout his remaining hospital course, with the 
exception of occasional eye opening to voice. The patient was 
continued on metoprolol for bp control (target is SBP<120) and 
sliding scale insulin for tight glycemic control. The patient's 
metoprolol may be titrated up at his extended care facility as 
tolerated to 50mg three times daily. The patient underwent PEG 
tube placement and IVC filter placement on [**3299-1-6**]. He 
tolerated tube feedings for > 4 hours prior to discharge. The 
patient should continue on DVT prophylaxis (subq heparin) 
despite IVC filter. This can be stopped if overt bleeding 
occurs.
.
# Question of saggital sinus thrombosis, though now not to be 
the case. See above.
.
# Normocytic anemia. Etiology unclear. On admission, Hct was 43, 
24 on the time of discharge. He has been persistently anemic 
since his surgery. The patient was trace guaiac positive in the 
setting IV heparin when thought to have sagittal sinus 
thrombosis. After several units of PRBCs, the patient Hct 
stabilized. Iron studies were inconsistent with iron deficiency 
and hemolysis labs were not consistent with hemolysis. 
.
# Anasarca/edema. Patient with lower extremity edema and left 
upper extremity anasarca. Likely secondary to low albumin. 
Ultrasounds negative for lower extremity or upper extremity DVT.
.
# Code Status. This was discussed with the patient's daughter 
who stated that the patient would have wanted to be fully 
rescuscitated unless there is long term evidence that he will 
not improve neurologically. He remains full code. This should be 
readdressed as the clinical condition is reassessed over time.

     INDICATION:  60-year-old man struck by car, evaluate for fracture.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast axial images of the cervical spine were obtained. 
     Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were also displayed.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of acute fracture.  Assessment of prevertebral
     soft tissues is limited by endotracheal tube.  Degenerative change is seen
     throughout the cervical spine with osteophyte formation and disc space
     narrowing noted at multiple levels.  Calcification in the posterior soft
     tissues possibly represents calcification of the nuchal ligament. 
     Intracranial hemorrhages are better evaluated on head CT performed the same

     INDICATION:  60-year-old man with subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage, status
     post bolt placement, evaluate for interval change.
     
     COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to study performed three hours earlier.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT scan.
     
     FINDINGS:  Patient is status post contrast-enhanced CT of the torso, limiting
     comparison to prior study in terms of intracranial hemorrhage.  Again seen is
     high-density material within the sulci of the frontal lobes bilaterally, as
     well as in the right extra-axial space consistent with subarachnoid and
     subdural hematoma.  Again seen is mass effect on the right lateral ventricle
     with leftward shift of normally midline structures by approximately 8 mm. This
     does not appear significantly changed from prior study.  Suprasellar cistern
     is not well evaluated secondary to high-density material within, possibly
     blood and contrast.  The appearance does not appear significantly changed from
     prior study, again possibly concerning for impending herniation although not
     well evaluated.  Patient is status post bolt placement in the right frontal
     lobe.  Comminuted calvarial fractures and subgaleal hematoma again noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Status post ICP monitor placement in the right frontal lobe.
     Direct comparison to prior study is limited because of interval contrast
     administration for CT of the torso, allowing for additional contrast bolus,
     there does not appear to be significant change from prior study.

     CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST; -77 BY DIFFERENT PHYSICIAN                [**Name Initial (PRE) 17**] # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 8089**]
     Reason: interval change

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      60 year old man with sdh and sah s/p bolt placement                             
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      interval change                                                                 
     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  60-year-old man with subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage, status
     post bolt placement, evaluate for interval change.
     
     COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to study performed three hours earlier.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT scan.
     
     FINDINGS:  Patient is status post contrast-enhanced CT of the torso, limiting
     comparison to prior study in terms of intracranial hemorrhage.  Again seen is
     high-density material within the sulci of the frontal lobes bilaterally, as
     well as in the right extra-axial space consistent with subarachnoid and
     subdural hematoma.  Again seen is mass effect on the right lateral ventricle
     with leftward shift of normally midline structures by approximately 8 mm. This
     does not appear significantly changed from prior study.  Suprasellar cistern
     is not well evaluated secondary to high-density material within, possibly
     blood and contrast.  The appearance does not appear significantly changed from
     prior study, again possibly concerning for impending herniation although not
     well evaluated.  Patient is status post bolt placement in the right frontal
     lobe.  Comminuted calvarial fractures and subgaleal hematoma again noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Status post ICP monitor placement in the right frontal lobe.
     Direct comparison to prior study is limited because of interval contrast
     administration for CT of the torso, allowing for additional contrast bolus,
     there does not appear to be significant change from prior study.

     INDICATION:  60-year-old man hit by a car, evaluate for facial fracture.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial non-contrast images of the facial bones were obtained.
     Coronal reformatted images were also displayed.
     
     There is slight cortical irregularity at the superior orbital rim , this
     possibly represents a non-displaced fracture.  No other orbital fractures are
     identified.  Again seen is fracture through the right temporal bone. Scout
     images again demonstrate large comminuted fracture through the cranium most
     fully evaluated on head CT.  Intracranial hemorrhage is also better evaluated
     on head CT.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Possible minimally displaced fracture of the right superior
     orbital rim.  No other orbital fractures identified.  Right temporal fracture
     again visualized.  Scout films better demonstrate comminuted calvarial
     fractures, which are better seen on head CT.  Intracranial hemorrhage, better
     evaluated on head CT.

     INDICATION:  60-year-old man struck by car, loss of consciousness.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired axial images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were
     obtained with IV contrast.  Multiplanar reformatted images were also
     displayed.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is no evidence of acute aortic
     injury. No evidence of segmental pulmonary embolism.  No pathologically
     enlarged mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy is identified.
     
     No evidence of pneumothorax.  Dependent opacities seen within the lungs
     bilaterally, suggesting atelectasis.  No focal consolidation or pleural
     effusion is seen.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  Small rounded hypodensities seen within
     the left lobe of the liver (series 2, image 67) possibly representing simple
     cyst, but too small to characterize by CT.  The liver otherwise appears
     unremarkable.  The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys
     appear unremarkable.  Visualized portions of the bowel appear within normal
     limits.  No evidence of free air or free fluid within the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The rectum, sigmoid, and prostate appear
     unremarkable.  Small amount of air is seen within the bladder likely secondary
     to Foley catheterization.  No free fluid seen within the pelvis.  Right
     femoral central venous catheter is noted.

     for bleed.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT scan.
     
     FINDINGS:  Large comminuted, slightly depressed calvarial fractures are
     identified.  Fractures are seen traversing the vertex of the skull, extending
     down the right temporal bone and left parietal bone.  There is slight
     deformity of the skull, with apparent depression of the parietal skull.
     
     High-density material is seen within the sulci of the frontal lobes
     bilaterally, as well as in the right parietals consistent with a subarachnoid
     hemorrhage.  High-density material is also seen along the falx, tentorium, and
     layering in the right extra-axial space, consistent with subdural hematoma.
     There is evidence of mass effect on the right lateral ventricle, with leftward
     shift of normally midline structures by approximately 8 mm.  Suprasellar
     cistern appears irregular, and third and fourth ventricles are not well

     INDICATION.
     
     FINDINGS:  Single frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates an ET tube with
     distal tip at the level of the clavicles.  The left subclavian line is
     demonstrated with distal tip overlying the mid SVC.  There is an NG tube
     visualized with side port overlying the fundus of the stomach.  The
     cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  The aorta is tortuous. 
     Patchy linear opacities are seen at both mid lung zones, likely a subsegmental
     atelectasis.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax after line placement. 
     There are no pleural effusions.

     NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN
     
     HISTORY:  Status post motor vehicle accident and craniectomy.  Evaluate for
     increased blood.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT scan.
     
     COMPARISON STUDY:  Non-contrast head CT scan of the same day, performed seven
     hours earlier.
     
     In the seven hour interval between studies, there is slightly more hemorrhage
     seen within the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 234**].  The rightward shift of normally midline
     structures seems little altered in extent and the ventricular size appears to
     be stable, as well.
     
     There does appear to be somewhat more conspicuous hypodensity within the right
     frontal lobe and along the medial aspect of the left frontal lobe.  These
     findings are of concern for infarction, possibly secondary to entrapment of
     the anterior cerebral arteries, as well as coexistent hemorrhagic contusions.
     There is somewhat more edema around the large right parietal convexity
     hemorrhage as well.  The massive quantity of subarachnoid hemorrhage, the
     small right parafalcine interhemispheric subdural hemorrhage, as well as small
     left cerebral convexity subdural hemorrhage are all redemonstrated.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Increasing edema in multiple areas of the brain of concern for
     ongoing infarction versus evolution of hemorrhagic contusions.
     
     ADDENDUM:  There is somewhat increased preseptal right-sided periorbital soft
     tissue swelling which extends towards the temporalis muscle.  Is there any
     concern for coagulopathic process?

     NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN
     
     HISTORY:  Status post right hemicraniectomy with head swelling during surgery.
     Post-operative CT scan requested.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT scan.
     
     COMPARISON STUDY:  [**3298-12-19**] study performed at 22:10 hours and
     reported by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1170**] as revealing, ""Minimal interval worsening of right
     subdural hemorrhage.  There is a suggestion of uncal herniation noted.""
     
     NOTE:  A wet reading, provided by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2948**] indicated, ""Massive new edema.
     Now midline shift to the right.  New intraventricular blood.  New collection
     along the falx superiorly.""
     
     FINDINGS:  Since the previous study, a right hemicraniectomy has been
     performed, through which there is moderate herniation of the right cerebral
     hemisphere.  There has been interval appearance of a longitudinally extensive,
     but relatively shallow, slightly hyperdense left cerebral hemispheric subdural
     hemorrhage causing effacement of the contiguous cerebral sulci.  Maximal width
     of this hemorrhage is approximately 7 mm.  There is also a spindle-shaped low-
     density right superior parafalcine subdural fluid collection that has evolved
     since the previous study, as well.  There is increase in the amount of
     hemorrhage likely along the inferior aspect of the right frontal lobe,
     presumably representing a hemorrhagic contusion.  Extensive subarachnoid
     hemorrhage is again seen. There is now a small amount of blood sedimenting
     within the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 234**].  There is approximately 7-mm rightward
     subfalcine herniation. Along the anterior aspect of the hemicraniectomy defect
     are collections of gas, presumably post-operative in nature in both intra- as
     well as extradural in locale.  There is also more extensive hemorrhage along
     the right parietal convexity surface of the brain.  The extensive subarachnoid
     hemorrhage previously seen is redemonstrated.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Status post right hemicraniectomy, with multiple abnormalities
     that have developed since the prior study, described in detail above.
     
     
                                                                 (Over)

     HISTORY:  60-year-old male with venous sinus hemorrhage, referred for
     assessment of interval change.
     
     COMPARISON:  Prior head CTs from [**12-19**] and [**3298-12-20**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  Direct comparison is made to the most recent head CT of [**3298-12-20**] at
     8:20 a.m.  Again demonstrated is prior partial right hemicraniectomy. There
     has been interval decrease in pneumocephalus underlying the craniectomy site.
     Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage involving both cerebral convexities and most
     prominent of the right frontal region is similar to the prior study.
     Intraparenchymal hemorrhage of the right frontal lobe is also not
     significantly changed.  Surrounding the sites of hemorrhage, there has been
     interval decrease in attenuation of the adjacent brain parenchyma consistent
     with evolving infarction and edema.  Mass effect from the large hemorrhagic
     contusions is similar to the prior study.  Blood in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 234**] of the
     left lateral ventricle is stable. There is increased fluid layering within the
     ethmoid, maxillary and sphenoid sinuses.  No definite new areas of
     intracranial hemorrhage are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Evolution of bilateral extraaxial and right frontal
     intraparenchymal hemorrhage with associated edema and infarction.

     NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN
     
     HISTORY:  Venous sinus bleed.  Status post partial craniectomy.  Assess for
     interval change.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT scan.
     
     COMPARISON STUDY:  Non-contrast head CT scan from [**12-21**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There has been no significant change in the appearance of the scan
     compared to the prior study of [**12-21**].  Once again, there are extensive
     areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage including a large collection of blood in the
     right parietal vertex region and the right frontal lobe.  There is a large
     area of low absorption also noted along the medial and superior aspect of the
     right cerebral hemisphere, extending into the right frontal lobe surrounding
     some of the hemorrhagic areas described above.  There is also low absorption
     in the left frontal lobe immediately and inferiorly.  The low density areas
     certainly could represent infarctions due to either direct brain damage or
     entrapment of feeding arteries due to subfalcine herniation.  At this time,
     however, there is no subfalcine herniation detected.  No uncal or hippocampal
     herniation is seen.  There is redemonstration of the right hemicraniectomy
     defect.  There are air/fluid levels within the sphenoid sinus and the left
     maxillary sinus with a mild-to-moderate degree of opacification of the ethmoid
     sinuses.  These findings presumably relate to the intubated state of the
     patient.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Stable, but grossly abnormal study as noted above.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Severe traumatic head injury resulting in inability to clinically
     assess the cervical spine.
     
     COMPARISON:  No previous cervical spine MRI.  Cervical spine CT dated [**12-19**], 2007 is available for correlation.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and STIR images of the cervical
     spine were obtained, with axial T2-weighted and gradient echo images from C2/3
     through C7/T1 interspaces.
     
     CERVICAL SPINE MRI WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The vertebral alignment is
     normal.  There are no signal abnormalities in the bone marrow, in the spinal
     ligaments, paraspinal soft tissues, or the spinal cord to suggest acute
     traumatic injury.  Mildly elevated T2 signal in the paratracheal and
     paraesophageal soft tissues, which are distinct from the prevertebral soft
     tissues, is felt to be related to instrumentation and/or secretions.
     Spondylosis without significant central canal narrowing is present at C4/5,
     C5/5, and C6/7.
     
     Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 8100**] at 6 p.m. on [**3298-12-24**].
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  No evidence of traumatic injuries in the cervical spine.  Please note that
     ligamentous injury cannot be definitively excluded by MRI.
     
     2.  Cervical spondylosis without central canal narrowing.

     HISTORY:  Status post hemicraniectomy, assess interval change.
     
     Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain.  No contrast was
     administered.  Comparison to a head CT of [**3298-12-23**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There have been no significant changes since the previous study. 
     Again demonstrated are extensive bifrontal hemorrhagic contusions, far more
     severe on the right than left.  Again identified is right hemispheric mass
     effect and right to left midline shift.  This patient is status post a right
     temporal and frontal craniectomy.  Brain herniates through the craniectomy
     defect.  This appears unchanged since the prior study.
     
     CONCLUSION:  No change since [**3298-12-23**].  Prior skull fracture,
     extensive hemorrhagic contusions, status post craniectomy with brain
     herniating through the craniectomy defect.

     EXAM:  MRI brain and MRA and MRV of the head.
     
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with numbness of subarachnoid hemorrhage and
     subdural hematoma and right frontal contusion, for further evaluation to
     exclude brain injury and sinus thrombosis.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  T1 sagittal and FLAIR, T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial
     images of the brain were acquired.  3D time-of-flight MRA of the circle of
     [**Location (un) 220**] was obtained and 2D time-of-flight MRV of the head were acquired.
     
     FINDINGS, BRAIN MRI:
     
     Correlation was made with the head CT of [**3298-12-25**].  Extensive hemorrhagic
     contusions are visualized involving right cerebral hemisphere in the frontal,
     parietal and temporal lobes with a craniectomy defect and slight herniation of
     the brain contents through the defect.  Hemorrhagic contusions are also seen
     involving left frontal lobe and left parietal lobe.  Subdural hematoma is seen
     along the falx along both convexities and also along the tentorium and
     posterior fossa.  The subdural hematomas are small in size with a maximum

     width of 5 mm.  Intraventricular blood is visualized in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 234**] of
     the left lateral ventricle.  A small amount of intraparenchymal blood is seen
     in the cerebellum as well.  There is no hydrocephalus.  Extensive soft tissue
     changes are seen in the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells which could be
     related to intubation.
     
     On the T2-weighted images, near the convexity in the parietal region,
     increased signal is seen within the superior sagittal sinus.  The remaining
     anterior portion of the superior sagittal sinus demonstrate decreased width of
     the flow void which could be secondary to compression.  Increased signal
     within the sinus is suspicious for thrombus.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Extensive brain contusions and small subdural hematomas
     bilaterally, along the falx and tentorium as described above.  Suspicion for
     increased signal within the mid portion of superior sagittal sinus in the
     parietal region which could indicate a thrombus or slow flow.
     
     MRA OF THE HEAD:
     
     The head MRA demonstrates hypoplastic A1 segment of the right anterior
     cerebral artery.  The right MCA appears slightly small in caliber than the
     left which could be due to bone contusion and swelling in the right cerebral
     hemisphere.  No vascular occlusion is identified.  Slight prominence of the
     anterior communicating artery is seen but no discrete aneurysm is identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Except for slight vascular stretching in the distribution of
     right middle cerebral artery which could be due to brain swelling in this
     region, no vascular occlusion is identified.
     
     MRV OF THE HEAD:
     
     The head MRV demonstrates flow in both transverse sinuses as well as in deep
     venous system.  However, the superior sagittal sinus is not well visualized.
     In its anterior portion, some flow is seen in the superior sagittal sinus, but
     in the mid portion in parietal region, no discrete flow channel is identified
     and collateral venous channels are visualized.  This is suspicious for
     thrombosis in this region.  Alternatively, this could be secondary to
     compression by surrounding brain edema and subdural hematoma.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Superior sagittal sinus appears distorted and narrowed with a
     question of thrombosis in its mid portion in the parietal region.  Transverse
     sinuses and the deep venous system is patent.

     COMPARISON:  MRI/MRA of the brain from earlier the same day and CT of the head
     from [**3298-12-25**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT. 
     
     FINDINGS:  The patient is status post a right craniectomy with brain
     herniating through the defect, as before.  There is extensive contusion
     involving the right frontal and parietal regions and to a lesser extent the
     left frontal region with surrounding extensive edema.  The degree of midline
     shift appears similar to the [**12-25**] study with prominence of the third
     ventricle and the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 234**] of the right lateral ventricle, also
     unchanged.  The suprasellar cistern remains well visualized.  Opacification of
     several ethmoid air cells and mastoid air cells persists.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Extensive bilateral evolving hemorrhagic contusions, status post
     right-sided craniectomy, and leftward subfalcine herniation are all similar in
     appearance over the past two days.  Basal cisterns remain well visualized.

     width of 5 mm.  Intraventricular blood is visualized in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 234**] of
     the left lateral ventricle.  A small amount of intraparenchymal blood is seen
     in the cerebellum as well.  There is no hydrocephalus.  Extensive soft tissue
     changes are seen in the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells which could be
     related to intubation.
     
     On the T2-weighted images, near the convexity in the parietal region,
     increased signal is seen within the superior sagittal sinus.  The remaining
     anterior portion of the superior sagittal sinus demonstrate decreased width of
     the flow void which could be secondary to compression.  Increased signal
     within the sinus is suspicious for thrombus.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Extensive brain contusions and small subdural hematomas
     bilaterally, along the falx and tentorium as described above.  Suspicion for
     increased signal within the mid portion of superior sagittal sinus in the
     parietal region which could indicate a thrombus or slow flow.
     
     MRA OF THE HEAD:
     
     The head MRA demonstrates hypoplastic A1 segment of the right anterior
     cerebral artery.  The right MCA appears slightly small in caliber than the
     left which could be due to bone contusion and swelling in the right cerebral
     hemisphere.  No vascular occlusion is identified.  Slight prominence of the
     anterior communicating artery is seen but no discrete aneurysm is identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Except for slight vascular stretching in the distribution of
     right middle cerebral artery which could be due to brain swelling in this
     region, no vascular occlusion is identified.
     
     MRV OF THE HEAD:
     
     The head MRV demonstrates flow in both transverse sinuses as well as in deep
     venous system.  However, the superior sagittal sinus is not well visualized.
     In its anterior portion, some flow is seen in the superior sagittal sinus, but
     in the mid portion in parietal region, no discrete flow channel is identified
     and collateral venous channels are visualized.  This is suspicious for
     thrombosis in this region.  Alternatively, this could be secondary to
     compression by surrounding brain edema and subdural hematoma.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Superior sagittal sinus appears distorted and narrowed with a
     question of thrombosis in its mid portion in the parietal region.  Transverse
     sinuses and the deep venous system is patent.

     INDICATION:  67-year-old man with superior sagittal sinus thrombosis.  Please
     perform CTV to exclude superior sagittal sinus thrombosis.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  A non-contrast head CT was also performed.  Then a CT with IV
     contrast was performed with delayed images through the brain to assess the
     venous sinuses.
     
     FINDINGS:  A non-contrast head CT demonstrates the prior hemicraniectomy with
     brain herniation through the surgical defect.  There is extensive white matter
     hypodensity, which has slightly progressed since prior examination.
     Specifically, now there is more hypodensity in the region of the right
     occipital lobe as well as right parietal lobe.  Areas of intraparenchymal
     hemorrhage are again identified and unchanged.  There is no evidence of uncal
     herniation.  A small amount of subfalcine herniation is again present.  There
     is a small amount of parafalcine low attenuation (CSF) fluid.
     
     Examination of the CTV demonstrates no evidence of sagittal sinus thrombosis.
     The transverse and sigmoid sinuses are also patent.  Straight sinus is also
     patent as is the vein of [**Male First Name (un) 2275**].

     HISTORY:  Fevers, positive sputum culture, question infiltrate.
     
     CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW
     
     A tracheostomy tube is in place.  An NG-type tube is present.  It curves over
     the upper abdomen, presumably extending into the small bowel, but clinical
     correlation is requested.  The heart is not enlarged, though there is left
     ventricular configuration.  Mild vascular haziness could represent minimal
     fluid overload, but no overt CHF is identified.  No focal infiltrate or
     effusion is seen.  A right-sided right subclavian central line tip is not
     optimally visualized, but appears to overlie the lower SVC.  No pneumothorax
     is detected.  Faint increased density in the colon presumably represents
     residual contrast from the previous imaging study.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No new infiltrate detected.  Mild vascular blurring could relate
     to respiratory motion or might indicate a very small amount of fluid overload.
     No overt CHF.

     INDICATION:  67-year-old male patient status post craniectomy for brain MRI
     for contusion status post MVA.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  A non-contrast head CT was performed.
     
     COMPARISON EXAMINATION:  Non-contrast head CT from [**3299-1-2**].
     
     FINDINGS:  Since that examination, there has been a large amount of
     improvement in the degree of mass effect in the right cerebral hemisphere.
     Small hyperdense regions remain present in the region of the right occipital
     lobe as well as the posterior right temporal lobe.  These findings could
     represent continued evolution of previously noted areas of hemorrhage whereas
     the more linear hyperdensity in the right occipital region likely represents
     laminar necrosis from a subacute infarct.  The left cerebral convexity
     subdural collection has resolved.  There are extensive periventricular white
     matter hypodensities bilaterally indicative of encephalomalacia.  There is a
     large area hyperdense and slightly heterogeneous area in the right frontal
     lobe, consistent with evolution of the large right frontal lobe hemorrhage
     previously again noted.
     
     New from the prior examination, there is enlargement of the ventricular system
     diffusely.  These findings are likely consistent with communicating
     hydrocephalus due to the prior hemorrhage.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Improved mass effect from prior examination.  Periventricular
     encephalomalacia with continued evolution of the previously noted large right
     frontal lobe hemorrhage.
     
     Resolution of the parafalcine subdural collection and the left cerebral
     convexity subdural collection.
     
     Enlargement of the entire ventricular system, likely due to communicating
     hydrocephalus.

     herniation through the right-sided craniotomy defect.  There is a small amount
     of hemorrhage laying within the left lateral ventricle.  Otherwise, no
     significant intracranial hemorrhage is identified.
     
     Hypoattenuation involving bifrontal lobes, likely representing post-contusion
     changes are unchanged.  Bone windows show a left-sided comminuted skull
     fracture and fluid within the left mastoid air cell.  There is a small polyp
     in the posterior right ethmoid air cell.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of left frontal-approach intraventricular
     catheter with the tip terminating in the third ventricle.  When compared to
     the previous exam, there has been interval increase in the degree of
     ventricular dilation, hydrocephalus with slight increased herniation of the
     brain parenchyma through the right craniotomy defect.

     elevated white count.  Please evaluate for infiltrate.
     
     Portable upright chest x-ray was reviewed and compared to [**3299-1-3**].  The
     patient is markedly rotated, limiting evaluation of the cardiomediastinal
     contours.  Tracheostomy tube is no longer present.  Lung fields are grossly
     clear, and there is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  VP shunt is
     seen extending from above the neck, into the peritoneal cavity.  Note is made
     of IVC filter and PEG tube. There is no free intraperitoneal air.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No focal consolidation.  Limited cardiomediastinal assessment due
     to patient rotation.

     HISTORY:  67-year-old man with right hemicraniotomy, elevated white count and
     heterotopic ossification noted in the right obturator internus and iliopsoas
     muscles, new from [**3298-12-28**].  Given right hip pain, concern for septic joint.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and STIR sequences, along with pre- and post-
     contrast axial images through bilateral hips were obtained.  Findings are
     compared with prior ultrasound dated [**3299-2-21**] and with prior CT examination
     dated [**3299-2-20**].
     
     FINDINGS:  As noted on recent prior ultrasound, there is extensive clot within
     the left lower venous system, extending from the left external iliac vein into
     the left common femoral vein and left superficial femoral vein.
     
     There is diffuse anasarca noted within the soft tissues, with edema noted in
     the adductors and in the gluteus musculature.  There is no hip joint
     effusion.
     
     Posterior to the right hip joint, there is a small fluid collection just
     underneath the gluteus musculature, that measures approximately 2.9 x 1.4 cm
     in maximal transverse x AP dimensions, (series 5, image 15).  There is thin
     rim enhancement around this collection.  Adjacent to the right hip joint is
     also ill-defined enhancement surrounding the acetabulum and greater
     trochanter, in the region of the patient's heterotopic ossification seen on
     recent CT.
     
     Additionally, behind the left greater trochanter there is a 4.3 x 2.4 cm
     distended bursa, (series 8, image 16), with thin rim enhancement as well.
     
     The constellation of these fluid collections and ill-defined enhancement may
     all represent heterotopic ossification, although myositis ossificans or
     infection are diagnostic considerations.
     
     There is no evidence for osseous signal abnormality.  Evaluation of the
     intrapelvic structures demonstrates a Foley balloon within the bladder.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Diffuse muscle edema in the adductors and the gluteus muscles.

     INDICATION:  Status post MVA with right hemicraniectomy.  Status post VP shunt
     for hydrocephalus.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
     
     COMPARISON EXAMINATION:  [**3299-2-20**].
     
     FINDINGS:  Since that examination, there has been improvement in the degree of
     mass effect.  The size of the lateral ventricles has decreased.  Again, there
     is a left frontal ventriculostomy catheter which terminates in the third
     ventricle.  Small amount of hyperdense material is still present within the
     dependent portion of the left lateral ventricle, consistent with
     intraventricular blood products.  The ventricular system still remains
     dilated.  The amount of periventricular white matter hypodensity is unchanged.
     No new intracranial hemorrhage is noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Compared to the prior examination of [**3299-2-20**], there has
     been reduction in the size of the ventricular system, but hydrocephalus
     remains.  The left frontal ventriculostomy catheter has its tip in the third
     ventricle.
     
     No new intracranial hemorrhage is noted.  The amount of mass effect and
     herniation of brain through craniectomy has also improved.

     [**3298-12-18**], followed by right hemicraniectomy; on anticoagulants, to
     evaluate for intracranial abnormality.  The patient is non-arousable.
     
     PRIOR STUDIES:  Several prior studies, the most recent CT head without
     contrast done on [**3299-2-23**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast CT of the head was performed.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     Status post right hemicraniectomy and ventricular drain through the left
     frontal approach with the tip in the right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 234**].
     
     There is a new, 2.9 x 2.1 x 2.5 cm hematoma in the right temporo-occipital
     region. There is significant mass effect with shift of the midline structures
     to the left side by approximately 1.1 cm and compression of the ipsilateral
     right lateral ventricle body and temporal [**Doctor Last Name 234**].  It is unclear if the mass
     effect is related to the edema from the hematoma or if there is another
     abnormality in the parenchyma. Bilateral cerebral white matter appears
     hypodense, as seen on the prior scan.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1,  New, 2.9 x 2.1 x 2.5 cm hematoma in the right temporo-occipital region.
     
     2.  New mass effect in the right cerebral hemisphere, with compression of the

     NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN.
     
     HISTORY:  Assess for change in right-sided collapse and hemorrhage.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT scan.
     
     COMPARISON STUDY:  [**3299-3-5**], head CT scan.
     
     NOTE:  Upon speaking with the attending physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 8133**], it
     appears that there has been interval adjustment of the shunt device.
     
     FINDINGS:  The extensive leftward subfalcine herniation, if anything, may be
     slightly greater at this time.  There has also been mild reduction in the size
     of the left lateral ventricle.  The nearly complete effacement of the right
     lateral ventricle, aside from a small portion of the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 234**],
     atrium and temporal [**Doctor Last Name 234**] tips, is unchanged.  The fourth ventricle remains
     moderately dilated.  The extent of low density within the white matter of both
     cerebral hemispheres is unaltered, as is the degree of the hemorrhage within
     the right temporal-parietal region.  No change in the position of the shunt
     catheter tip is apparent, compared with the [**3299-2-23**] scan.
     
     The massive depression of the brain surface throughout the large craniectomy
     defect is similar in extent. There remains moderate opacification of the left
     mastoid sinus complex, possibly by fluid, mucosal thickening or combination of
     these two. Remainder of the incompletely imaged paranasal sinuses are normal.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Progressive decrease in size of the left lateral ventricle with
     continued massive leftward subfalcine herniation of the brain.  Other findings
     as noted above.  These observations were discussed immediately with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 8133**] following conclusion of the scan.

     HISTORY:  67-year-old man with VP shunt/collapsed ventricle, now with right
     unreactive pupil.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3299-3-7**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  There has been interval significant worsening of shift of normally
     midline structures to the left.  The degree of subfalcine herniation has
     increased from approximately 8 mm to 15 mm.  There is concomitant compression
     of the third and right lateral ventricles.  There is stable dilatation of the
     left lateral ventricle.  The right parietotemporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage
     is not significantly changed.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are stable.
     The position of the shunt catheter is unchanged.  Left mastoid opacification
     and scleral buckle are again identified.  No change is identified in the right
     craniotomy site.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Interval significant worsening in shift of normally midline
     structures to the left and subfalcine herniation.  This was discussed with Dr.
