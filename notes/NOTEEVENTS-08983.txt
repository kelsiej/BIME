Admission Date:  [**3373-9-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**3373-9-29**]

Date of Birth:   [**3309-7-21**]       Sex:  M

Service:  VASCULAR

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Nonhealing right foot ulceration.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 64-year-old male
who has end-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis, who is
admitted now for a nonhealing right foot ulceration times six
months.  The patient is status post right fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass.
This was done in [**State 4011**].  He has been followed by his
primary care physician at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  He was referred to
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 93**] for treatment.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery bypass.
2.  AV fistula.
3.  Diabetes.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Status post left BKA.
6.  Status post right fem-[**Doctor Last Name **].
7.  Right AV fistula.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lantus 32 units q.a.m.
2.  Humalog sliding scale before meals.
3.  Isosorbide 30 mg q.d.
4.  Plavix 75 mg q. other day.
5.  Nephrocaps one q.d.
6.  PhosLo Gelcaps 667 mg one with meals.
7.  Aspirin.
8.  Neurontin 300 mg q.d.
9.  Protonix 40 mg q.d.
10. Paxil 20 mg q.d.
11. Toprol 25 mg q.d.
12. Zocor 80 mg q.d.
13. Colace 100 mg b.i.d.
14. Senokot tablets p.r.n.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  General:  This is a white
male in no acute distress.  Heart: Regular rate and rhythm.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.  Abdomen:  Unremarkable.
Pulse:  Palpable femorals bilaterally, right DP and PT were
biphasic signals.  On the left, he had undergone a BKA.  His
graft was biphasic palpable proximally.  The AV fistula was
palpable.  Neurologic:  Unremarkable.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital.
He was begun on IV antibiotics.  The Renal service followed
the patient for hemodialysis needs.  The patient's potassium
was elevated at 6.2 on admission.  He was treated with
Kayexalate and it was 5.1 post treatment.  He underwent
dialysis on his regular scheduled day.  Cardiology was
requested to see the patient for perioperative risk
assessment.

Cardiology felt that because the patient had undergone bypass
surgery with four grafts in [**3365**], the grafts were patent on
cardiac catheterization in [**3371**], and the P MIBI of 2002
showed fixed anterior wall defect who was relatively
asymptomatic with cardiac symptoms would be considered at a
moderate risk for surgery.  They recommended no further
cardiac evaluation.  Beta blockers perioperatively and
proceed to surgery.

On [**3373-9-21**], the patient underwent revision of right
BK [**Doctor Last Name **]-DP bypass graft using in situ saphenous vein fem-DP.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred
to the PACU in stable condition and remained hemodynamically
stable.

On postoperative day number one, there were no overnight
events.  His examination showed a right foot that was warm
with a lateral heel ulcer which was clean without granulation
tissue, a palpable right DP pulse.  He was converted to
Percocet for analgesic control.  He was ambulated out of bed.
Diet was advanced as tolerated.  Subcutaneous heparin was
begun for DVT prophylaxis and he was de-lined and transferred
to the floor.  A D10 drip was begun for hypoglycemia.

The patient did develop hypotension postoperatively with T
wave flattening in the lateral leads, although his count
remained stable at 38.4, BUN 32, creatinine 7.2, K 3.9.
Serial CKs and troponins were drawn.  Cardiology recommended
to hold his Isosorbide and Lopressor, obtain an
echocardiogram to assess his left ventricular function and
continue monitoring enzymes, consider transfer to ICU with
dopamine support and rule out sepsis.

An echocardiogram was obtained in which the preliminary
reading revealed that the global ejection fraction was 30%
with anterior and anteroseptal akinesis, inferior wall basal
segment, hypokinetic.  There was no pericardial effusion.  He
had borderline RV function.  They felt that the findings were
consistent with chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy and not an
acute episode and continued with his PA line.  He was
transferred to the ICU.  Dopamine was begun.  The patient's
CKs remained flat.  His initial troponin was 0.20, greater
than 1.0 suggests an acute MI.  Remaining serial troponins
were 0.18.

Over the next 48 hours, the patient continued to show
improvement.  Dopamine was weaned.  He maintained his
systolic blood pressure greater than 110.  His A line was
discontinued and he was transferred out of the CCU.  The
patient was transferred to the VICU from the CCU.  He
remained there overnight.  He continued to progress.  He was
de-lined and transferred to the floor for continued care.

Podiatry was consulted on postoperative day number one.  They
reviewed his foot films.  On [**3373-9-27**], the patient
underwent a met head resection and tolerated the procedure
well.  The initial dressing was removed on postoperative day
number one.  The wounds were clean, dry, and intact.  The
hematocrit remained stable at 35.5, BUN 60, creatinine 9.1, K
4.7.

He was seen by Physical Therapy and felt that he was safe to
be discharged to home, partial weightbearing with healing
sandals on the affected side.  He will require to be seen by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4381**] in two to three weeks for suture removal and
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 93**] in a weeks time as directed.  The
patient was discharged in stable condition.  The wounds were
clean, dry, and intact.  He had a working graft pulse.

     the shoulder, 0.32 and 0.37 in the arm, and 0.08 and 0.21 cm in the forearm.
     
     The caliber of the left basilic vein varies between 0.36 and 0.47 cm
     proximally, 0.29 and 0.31 in its midportion, and 0.23 to 0.27 at the level of
     the forearm.
     
     CONCLUSION: Patency of the right lesser saphenous vein, left cephalic and
     left basilic vein, with dimensions as noted above.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
       64 year old man 1 day s/p 1st met debridement for osteo.                       
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      assess surgical resection site for any additional osteo                         
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  One day status post 1st metatarsal debridement for osteomyelitis.
     Assess surgical resection site for possibly additional osteomyelitic
     processes.
     
     FINDINGS: AP, oblique and lateral views of the right foot are analyzed in
     direct comparison with next preceding examination of [**3373-9-24**], i.e., prior to
     the present surgical resection.  It demonstrates that the previously present
     free bony fragments in the distal portion of the 1st metatarsal have been
     removed practically completely.  Remaining tiny calcifications are most likely
     to represent vascular calcifications which are quite extensive in the entire
     foot.  Also the first metatarsal has been amputated in the distal portions
     which appeared quite irregularly contoured and gave suspicion for
     osteomyelitic destructions.  The now present remnants of the first metatarsal
     have a quite normal skeletal appearance with relatively smooth distal
     amputation site. Some increased translucency distally appeared to be
     coinciding with similar translucencies in the soft tissues and are unlikely to
     involve the bony structures themselves.
     
     Rather extensive arterial calcifications and evidence of surgical clips in the
     tarsal area are unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful removal of bony fragments and suspicious distal
     portion of 1st metatarsal.  Follow up examinations will probably be helpful to
     identify if new osteomyelitic processes should recur.
