Admission Date:  [**2991-9-22**]     Discharge Date:  [**2991-10-9**]

Date of Birth:   [**2941-6-19**]     Sex:  F

Service:  General Surgery - Blue Team

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 50-year-old
female with a history of Crohn's colitis who complains of
three days of abdominal pain, mostly in the left lower
quadrant.  Chest x-ray revealed free air.  The patient also
had a white blood cell count of 16.  The patient was admitted
to the hospital.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Considering the free air, there was a
likely perforated viscus so the patient was immediately taken
to the operating room on [**9-22**].  The patient underwent
exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, sigmoid colectomy
and colostomy and Hartmann's for a perforated sigmoid colon.
Surgeon of record was Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Assistant, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11062**].
Findings included multiple intraperitoneal abscesses,
perforated sigmoid colon.

Post-operatively the patient was taken to the ICU with a
Propofol drip for sedation, was intubated especially
considering the patient's history of idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis.  The patient also required Neo and a Swan as the
case intraoperatively was complicated by hypotension.  The
patient was put on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Clindamycin
and Protonix, subcu Heparin and a regular insulin sliding
scale.  Over the next few days the patient was able to be
weaned off of pressors and the SICU team continued to attempt
to wean the patient from the ventilator. On [**9-24**] the patient
was extubated.  Incidentally cultures came back that day from
the intraabdominal fluid, gram positive cocci 3+, gram
negative rods 4+, gram positive rods 3+.  Status post
extubation the patient had several episodes of respiratory
distress, likely the patient's history of pulmonary fibrosis
and pulmonary hypertension contributed to this.  The patient
did receive some Lasix with a good effect as she had received
a large amount of fluid perioperatively.  As of 8-26 the
patient required 100% non rebreather with O2 sats greater
than 90%.  The patient remained on Hydrocortisone as
treatment for the patient's pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary
hypertension and was also receiving Lasix 20 mg bid.  The
patient continued to get aggressive chest physical therapy.
Cultures on the patient's endotracheal tube grew out E. coli
and Ceftriaxone was added to the Vanco, Levofloxacin,
Clindamycin antibiotic regimen.  The patient's respiratory
status continued to improve and thus the patient was sent to
the floor.  On [**9-29**] the patient was satting 94% on 40% plus 6
liters nasal cannula.  The patient had an episode of
desaturation on 6 liters to 88% on [**10-1**].  More aggressive
pulmonary toilet was required.  The patient was put on 100%
non rebreather and sats came up to 95%.  Levofloxacin was
discontinued.  TPN was started.  The patient was advanced to
clear diet on [**10-3**].  The patient had an episode of
desaturation on the night of 9-3, desaturated to 82% on mask,
up to 99% on non rebreather.  Also complained of feeling of
dyspnea.  At 1 a.m. on [**10-4**] the patient complained of chest
pain.  EKG showed no change.  Chest x-ray showed no change
from [**10-1**].  ABG was 7.47/43/64/32/6 on 15 liters non
rebreather.  The patient was given Lasix and then was
transferred back to the SICU.  The patient was found on CT
scan to have a small fluid collection in the pelvis which had
had a pigtail catheter in.  This drainage tube was clogged
[**10-4**], interventional aspirated and flushed the tube and
unclogged it and orders were written to flush his catheter
tid.  Respiratory service was consulted on [**10-5**].  The
pulmonologist recommended continuing antibiotics, tapering
Hydrocortisone, continuing general diuresis.  On [**10-7**] the
patient was requiring C-pap to maintain oxygen saturation and
at noon on [**10-7**] the patient was reintubated.  Patient's blood
pressure dropped to 80/40 so the patient was put on
Neo-Synephrine.  On [**10-8**] the patient underwent a bronchoscopy
that showed thick secretions.  During the procedure the
patient had episodes of hypotension and tachycardia.  The
patient required FIO2 in the 90% range to maintain O2
saturation.  ICU team was unable to wean down the FIO2.
Every time they attempted to wean down the FIO2 the patient
would desaturate.  On [**10-9**] the patient required an FIO2 of
100% to maintain O2 sats in the low 90's.  At this point in
time it appeared that secondary to patient's history of
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the patient's prognosis was
very poor and this poor prognosis was discussed with the
family.  At noon the family decided that in light of the
patient's poor prognosis, she should be made comfort measures
only.  The patient was thus taken off all pressors and was
pronounced dead at 12:50 p.m. on [**10-9**] and the death
certificate was filed.

     INDICATION:  50-year-old woman S/P sigmoid colectomy.  S/P extubation with
     poor oxygenation.  Rule out atelectasis versus edema.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  A single AP upright view of the chest is provided.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is diffuse increased density in both lung fields consistent
     with diffuse interstitial infiltrate.  Some areas of confluence are noted
     particularly in the right base and left mid-line and consistent with alveolar
     disease.  These findings are most likely related to diffuse pulmonary
     infiltrate and/or ARDS.
     
     The cardiac silhouette and mediastinum are within normal limits.  A right
     jugular line is again noted with tip located in the superior vena cava.  There
     is an NG tube within the stomach.
     
     Blunting of the right lateral costophrenic region may represent small pleural
     effusion.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Diffuse pulmonary infiltrate.
     
     2)  Small right effusion.

     CLINICAL INDICATION:  50 year old woman status post sigmoid colectomy.  Poor
     oxygenation status post extubation.  IPF follow-up.
     
     A single AP semi-upright portable radiograph of the chest was obtained and
     compared to the next-prior study of [**2991-9-25**].
     
     An NG tube remains in good position with its tip in the upper stomach.  The
     overall heart size is within normal limits and is stable in appearance.  The
     mediastinal and hilar contours also appear stable in appearance.  Again
     identified is a diffuse interstitial and alveolar pattern of opacity involving
     both right and left lungs.  There has been an interval increase in the
     alveolar opacity involving the right middle lobe and possibly the right lower
     lobe.  No pleural effusions are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Diffuse underlying interstitial and alveolar pattern of opacity.  This
     appearance is consistent with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  Prior
     radiographs would be helpful to assess chronicity of this process.
     
     2) Interval increase in opacity involving the right middle lobe and possibly
     the right lower lobe.  This finding raises the suspicion for overlying
     infectious process at this location.

      r/o abscess
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Crohn's disease, post sigmoid resection following perforation of
     a diverticulum.  Now with elevated WBC despite antibiotic coverage.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Initial helical axial images through the abdomen and pelvis were
     performed following administration of 150 cc IV Optiray contrast and oral
     contrast (patient has an allergy to multiple meds).  The patient was then
     rescanned following instillation of dilute Conray into the urinary bladder.
     After identification of the pelvic abscess, a drainage was performed as
     described below.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The patient is post sigmoid resection, with a
     colostomy and a Hartmans fistula.  In the pelvis, anterior to the rectal
     stump, between the cecum which has descended into the pelvis is a 3 x 8.5 cm
     fluid collection with [**Doctor Last Name **] of 40 [**Doctor Last Name **].  There is enhancement of the wall of this
     collection.  In addition there are two superficial low attenuation fluid
     collections along the course of the abdominal wall incision.  These were
     subsequently marked for aspiration by the surgical house staff on the floor.
     
     The urinary bladder was filled with contrast and is normal and does not
     communicate with the collection.  The cecum has descended into the pelvis
     following patient's hysterectomy.  The remainder of the visualized bowel is
     normal.  No abnormalities are seen within the liver, pancreas or spleen. There
     is mild fullness of the right renal collecting system and the right ureter.
     The kidneys are otherwise unremarkable.  Both adrenal glands are normal. There
     is extensive fibrosis of both lower lung bases consistent with the patient's
     known diagnostic idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
     
     CT GUIDANCE:  In discussion with the surgical house staff on the patient,
     decision was made to drain the pelvic collection.  Informed written consent
     was obtained.  Standard sterile technique was used.  The patient was placed in
     a left side down decubitus position and the position of the abscess was
     confirmed by rescanning.  1% Lidocaine was used for local anesthetic with
     bicarbonate.  Versed was administered IV by the surgical house staff for
     sedation under direct vital sign monitoring.
     
     A 20 gauge spinal needle was used as a guidance.  Using CT fluoroscopy, a 10
     French pig-tail catheter was advanced into the pelvic fluid collection.  Its
     location was confirmed by CT fluoroscopy.  Purulent fluid was aspirated and
     the pig-tail was then formed.
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION:  pulmonary fibrosis.  Pelvic fluid collection was drained on
     [**2991-10-1**]; evaluate for residual fluid collection.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helical scanning of the chest was performed with the chest CTA
     protocol after administration of 100 cc Optiray.  Helical scanning was then
     performed through the abdomen and pelvis.  Multiplanar reconstructions of the
     chest were performed.
     
     CHEST CT WITH CONTRAST:  There are multiple enlarged mediastinal and
     subcarinal lymph nodes, which measure between 1-2 cm in the short axis.  There
     is no axillary or hilar adenopathy.  There is diffuse thickening of the
     interlobular septae of both lungs associated with multifocal areas of ground-
     glass opacity.  There are no plueral or pericardial effusions.  Heart size is
     upper normal.  The main pulmonary trunk has a diameter of 4.6 cm, suggestive
     of pulmonary artery hypertension. The trachea and segmental bronchi are
     patent.  There is slightly more focal consolidation in the medial portion of
     the right lower lobe.
     
     No destructive lytic or blastic lesions are seen in the osseous structures of
     the torso.
     
     ABDOMEN CT WITH CONTRAST:  No abnormality is seen in the liver, pancreas,
     spleen, adrenals or kidneys.  The gallbladder is not visualized.  There is no
     adenopathy in the mesentery or retroperitoneum.
     
     PELVIS CT WITH CONTRAST:  The opacified loops of small bowel and colon are
     normal.  There is no extravasation of oral contrast.  The kidneys show
     symmetric nephrograms and excretion. The visualized ureters have normal
     diameter.  The bladder is collapsed around the Foley catheter.
     
     The posterior pelvic fluid collection is smaller than on [**2991-10-1**].  The pigtail
     of the drainage catheter is in good position within the fluid collection.
     
     The anterior subcutaneous fluid collection in the midline of the abdomen has
     resolved post incision and drainage. There is a large open wound in the
     midline of the lower abdomen with air in the subcutaneous tissues.  Oral
     contrast has passed into the ostomy bag overlying the left lower quadrant.
     There are no new fluid collections in the abdomen or pelvis.

     2. There are no new fluid collections in the abdomen or pelvis.  Oral contrast
     reached the ostomy bag with no evidence of extravasation.
     
     3. Diffuse interstitial disease in the lung with multifocal ground-glass
     opacity is consistent with the known history of pulmonary fibrosis.  There
     could be superimposed pulmonary edema and/or an interstitial infection.

     subcarinal lymph nodes, which measure between 1-2 cm in the short axis.  There
     is no axillary or hilar adenopathy.  There is diffuse thickening of the
     interlobular septae of both lungs associated with multifocal areas of ground-
     glass opacity.  There are no plueral or pericardial effusions.  Heart size is
     upper normal.  The main pulmonary trunk has a diameter of 4.6 cm, suggestive
     of pulmonary artery hypertension. The trachea and segmental bronchi are
     patent.  There is slightly more focal consolidation in the medial portion of
     the right lower lobe.
     
     No destructive lytic or blastic lesions are seen in the osseous structures of
     the torso.
     
     ABDOMEN CT WITH CONTRAST:  No abnormality is seen in the liver, pancreas,
     spleen, adrenals or kidneys.  The gallbladder is not visualized.  There is no
     adenopathy in the mesentery or retroperitoneum.
     
     PELVIS CT WITH CONTRAST:  The opacified loops of small bowel and colon are
     normal.  There is no extravasation of oral contrast.  The kidneys show
     symmetric nephrograms and excretion. The visualized ureters have normal
     diameter.  The bladder is collapsed around the Foley catheter.
     
     The posterior pelvic fluid collection is smaller than on [**2991-10-1**].  The pigtail
     of the drainage catheter is in good position within the fluid collection.
     
     The anterior subcutaneous fluid collection in the midline of the abdomen has
     resolved post incision and drainage. There is a large open wound in the
     midline of the lower abdomen with air in the subcutaneous tissues.  Oral
     contrast has passed into the ostomy bag overlying the left lower quadrant.
     There are no new fluid collections in the abdomen or pelvis.

     (Cont)
     On further inspection of the drainage tube, it was clogged with thick purulent
     fluid.  Approximately 20 cc of pus was aspirated from the tube.  It was then
     irrigated with 50 cc normal saline.  Orders were written to flush the catheter
     three times a day.
     
     RECONSTRUCTIONS:  There are no filling defects in the opacified pulmonary
     arterial vessels.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. The pigtail drainage catheter is in good position within the posterior
     pelvic fluid collection.  This fluid collection is smaller than on [**2991-10-1**]. The
     catheter was aspirated and irrigated and orders were written to flush the
     catheter three times a day.
     
     2. There are no new fluid collections in the abdomen or pelvis.  Oral contrast
     reached the ostomy bag with no evidence of extravasation.
     
     3. Diffuse interstitial disease in the lung with multifocal ground-glass
     opacity is consistent with the known history of pulmonary fibrosis.  There
     could be superimposed pulmonary edema and/or an interstitial infection.
     
     4. No evidence of pulmonary embolus.

     FINDINGS: AP view demonstrates that the patient is intubated the ETT with its
     tip some 7 cm above the carina. An NG tube has been placed reaching far below
     the diaphragm. The heart appears to be moderately enlarged without typical
     configurational abnormality. Bilateral the lung fields demonstrate diffuse
     small nodular and linear densities consistent with the diagnosis of pulmonary
     fibrosis. Evidence for these abnormalities existed already a previous
     examination of [**2991-10-4**]. Comparison demonstrates that the previously
     identified nodular densities on the right base has cleared up somewhat but the
     diffuse pattern of nodular density persists.
