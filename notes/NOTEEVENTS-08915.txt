History of Present Illness:
Pt. is a 56 y/o w/ MMP including cirrhosis, chronic renal 
insufficiency, diabetes who p/w mental status changes. History 
per EMS report/daughter. Pt. w/ long h/o cirrhosis, unclear 
baseline mental status. Recently pt. w/ gait instability. One 
day prior to presentation, pt. flew from [**State 9504**] to here for 
evaluation by liver transplant team at [**Hospital1 **]. On day of arrival to 
MAss., but was talking, but seemed confused. Over the next 24 
hours, pt. had nausea/vomiting, but continued to take insulin. 
Pt. was unable to answer questions, not talking, seemed weak and 
was having difficulty walking. Daughter unable to confirm if pt. 
had complaints, but did note rigors in the a.m. and cough. Day 
of admission - pt's daughter called EMS and pt. was taken to 
[**Hospital3 **].  
.  
At OSH, pt. was tachycardic, but otherwise VSS. On evaluation, 
he was intermittently following commands, not answering 
questions. Pt. found to have ammonia for 236. Pt. given 
lactulose. Pt. w/ FS at OSH was 66 (given D50). Pt. was also 
given 2 L NS, thiamine and kayexalate(45 mg) for hyperkalemia. 
Pt. was transferred to [**Hospital1 83**] for further liver evaluation.  
.  
In ED, pt w/ mental status changes - oriented to person only. 
Pt. was sleepy, but combatative. Concern for encephalopathy 
given high ammonia level at OSH. Pt. was in need of infectious 
w/u including extensive CT scans. Concern for sedating pt. w/ MS 
changes and risking apneic arrest in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] decision was made to 
intubate patient for airway protection. Per report from ED 
attending, pt. was oxygenating well w/ good sats at that point.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Hepatic encephalopathy: MS changes from Cirrhosis and hepatic 
encephalopathy aggravated by pneumonia.  Condition became 
progressively worse and then he was deemed not be a candidate 
for liver transplant.
.
# Renal Failure: complicated w/ hyperkalemia. Most likely from 
hepatorenal syndrome. Dialysis was performed intially but then 
team decided to stop once it was decided to make him CMO.
.
# Diabetes - pt. w/ insulin dependent diabetes.  Pt. w/ 
hypoglycemia in ED.  Will monitor sugars and ISS for now
.
# Code Status: after extensive discussion between Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] and

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     56-year-old male with encephalopathy and diffuse bodily bruising.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT continuously acquired axial images of the cervical spine were
     obtained without IV contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were
     performed.
     
     CT OF THE CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There is no evidence of fracture
     or spondylolisthesis.  There is preservation of the vertebral body heights.
     There is chronic degenerative change at the C5/6 level with endplate sclerosis
     and mild-to-moderate disc space narrowing and a posterior osteophyte, which
     indents the spinal canal.  The patient is intubated.  The prevertebral soft
     tissues are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No fracture or malalignment of the cervical spine.  Chronic
     degenerative change at C5/6.
     
     ER dashboard wet read at 10:20 p.m., [**3391-6-1**].
     
     NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: The osteophytes at C5-6 cause moderate to
     severe narrowing of the spinal canal on the right and likely compress the
     spinal cord.

      please do a RUQ US with dopplers to eval hepatic parenchyma and bile ducts      
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  56-year-old man with cirrhosis, massive ascites and
     encephalopathy.  Need evaluation of liver vascular flows, Doppler.
     
     STUDY:  Portable liver/gallbladder ultrasound with Doppler.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  2D grayscale and color Doppler sonography was performed of the
     liver and gallbladder.
     
     FINDINGS:
     The liver is shrunken, nodular, and diffusely echogenic consistent with
     cirrhosis.  No focal hepatic lesions.  Portal vein is patent and has
     hepatopetal flow.  Hepatic arteries are patent.  Hepatic veins are patent,
     though they have decreased variability.  No intrahepatic biliary ductal
     dilatation.  Common bile duct is normal in caliber measuring 3 mm.  The
     gallbladder is entirely filled with sludge.  No definite gallbladder wall
     thickening, however, assessment is slightly limited because of cirrhotic liver
     and sludge filled gallbladder.  There is marked ascites within the upper
     abdomen.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     Cirrhotic liver with marked ascites, but patent vessels.  No focal hepatic
     lesion.  Sludge filled gallbladder.

     left lung than the right.  Heart is normal size.  ET tube and nasogastric tube
     are in standard placements.  There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural

      56 year old man with end-stage liver disease, chronic kidney disease, ? cord

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      eval for cord compression

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CERVICAL SPINE MRI SCAN:
     
     HISTORY:  End-stage liver disease and chronic kidney disease.  Question of
     cord compression on CT of the neck.  Evaluate for cord compression.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2-weighted as well as axial gradient echo
     scans of the cervical spine.
     
     COMPARISON STUDY: CT of the cervical spine dated [**3391-6-1**] interpreted by
     doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 11706**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 322**] as revealing ""osteophytes at C5-6 cause moderate to
     severe narrowing of the spinal canal on the right and likely compress the
     spinal cord.""
     
     FINDINGS:  Unfortunately, a number of the imaging sequences are of limited
     resolution due to patient motion.  In that regard, the sagittal T1-weighted
     scans are nearly uninterpretable, despite repeat scanning attempts.
     
     FINDINGS:  At C4/5, uncovertebral spurring produces prominent left and
     moderate right-sided neural foraminal stenosis, in accord with the recent CT
     scan.
     
     At C5/6, a moderate posterior spondylytic ridge causes moderate deformity of
     the spinal cord along its ventral margin with a slight caudal extension of the
     ridge to the right of midline, again mildly deforming the right ventrolateral
     cord margin.  Motion artifacts render foraminal dimension assessment
     difficult, but I believe uncovertebral spurring at this locale again causes
     prominent foraminal stenosis, in accord with the recent CT scan.  This disc is
     moderately narrowed.  No other overt spinal or paraspinal pathology is seen.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Poor quality imaging secondary to patient motion but with
     reasonable correspondence of the MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] findings as noted above.  
     
     COMMENT:  There are probable secretions layering within the oro- and
     nasopharynx regions.  Apparently, the patient is intubated.

     is in the stomach.  Right middle lobe and right lower lobe discoid atelectasis
     is grossly unchanged.  Persistent patchy left retrocardiac opacity may be due
     to atelectasis or infection.  There is some mild peribronchial cuffing which
     may represent mild fluid overload or peribronchial inflammation.

EVENTS:  Pt extubated at 12:00

Neuro.
Pt alert this am, less so at present, trying to make needs known, though not effective, unable to articulate very well, not following commands consistantly.  Gradually becoming encephalopathic again.
Neurology saw pt to try to clear neck, pt unable to answer as to pain in neck so unable to clear at present, will probably need to flouro c-spine.

Resp.
Extubated as above, now on face mask, 70% humidified, with adequate abg [**Name8 (MD) 34**] MD's.  Pt with weak cough effort, able to expectorate thick yellow sputum with encouragement, C+DB encouraged.  Pt re-positioned multiple times due to habit of slumping to his left and sliding down in bed (pt most comfortable in this position).

CVS.
HR 80's NSR with no ectopy seen, BP stable via positional a-line.
No contact regarding cardiac cath as yet.

GI/GU.
OG tube pulled with ETT, pt aspirated when tried on sips of H2O, so meds held at present, team plan to place dophoff tube for meds/feeds.
Passing small amounts of liquid stool via mushroom cath.
Foley patent for small amounts of clear amber urine at 10-30cc/hr, bladder pressure this am 15.  No plans for dialysis or diuresis at this time.
Abdomen increasingly distended due to ascites, no plans to tap as yet.

Endo.
Continues on Insulin gtt, now at 1.5 units/hr with stable FSG checked Q2hrs now.

Skin.
No change in skin status this shift, multiple areas of echymosis to torso, face and arm, multiple abrasions healing over slowly.

Social.
Visited by wife for short period, she became quite upset at times and felt it best to leave for the day.  She is spending most of time looking for appartments for her to live in while here, and her costs are mounting.
Team have ordered an ethics consult for all team members, and family, so that goals can be discussed, and realistic plan established, no date or time as yet.

Plan.
Dophoff at bedside.
Aggressive pulmonary toilet.
Encourage C+DB.
Monitor MS closely.

     INDICATION:  Rule out listhesis or ligamentous injury in a 56-year-old male.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Two lateral fluoroscopic images of the cervical spine in flexion
     and extension are submitted for interpretation on [**3391-6-23**].  Image
     quality is very limited, due to lack of coning of the fluoroscopic image.
     
     FINDINGS:  C2 through C5 are visualized on these images.  C1-C2 articulation
     is seen only on the extension view.  During flexion, there is minimal
     straightening of the cervical lordosis.  No evidence of anterolisthesis is
     present.  There is a nasogastric tube overlying the anterior spinal tissues.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Limited visualization of the cervical spine showing minimal
     straightening of the lordosis during flexion, without evidence of
     anterolisthesis.  The lower cervical spine is not visualized, due to
     obscuration by the patient's shoulders.

Would recommend getting social work more involved so wife feels she has more support systems to contact.
