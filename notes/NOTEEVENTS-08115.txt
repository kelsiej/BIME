Pt required intubation due to worsening hypoxemia/pumonary edema. Intubated by anesthesia with 7.5 et tube taped at 23 initially then at 21cm per CXR. Suctioned for copious amounts of frothy red sputum immediately following intubation, improved by change of shift. ABGs are with compensated met alkalosis. Oxygenation only fair requiring high FIO2 to maintain. Would benefit from increase of peep but pt has been hypotensive requiring pressors. Plan is to increase peep/lower FIO2 as able per hemodynamaics.
