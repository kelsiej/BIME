Admission Date:  [**2814-10-20**]     Discharge Date:  [**2814-11-4**]

Date of Birth:   [**2732-12-26**]     Sex:  F

Service:  Cardiology

ADDENDUM:
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent an electrophysiology
study and ventricular tachycardia focus ablation on [**2814-10-22**].
Eight different inducible foci were ablated.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well.  There were some residual
ventricular tachycardic foci remaining and the patient was
placed on Amiodarone 400 mg per day times three months and it
was planned to have a biventricular automatic implantable
converter and defibrillator placed on the following Monday.
The patient remained on the inpatient service with no
complications from her ablation, no ectopic beats on
monitoring by telemetry.  On [**2814-10-27**] the patient underwent
AICD placement.  The procedure was complicated by difficult
placement of the wires with multiple attempts of placement of
the leads.  The patient became hypotensive during the
procedure.  An echocardiogram demonstrated that there was no
pericardial effusion or tamponade.  The patient was placed on
Dopamine with good recovery of blood pressure and it was
presumed that her hypotension was secondary to high dose of
Fentanyl given during the procedure.  The patient was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on Dopamine drip for
maintenance of blood pressure.  The patient was found the
following morning to be in an accelerated idioventricular
rhythm with AV dissociation and that this was contributing to
her hypotension with systolic blood pressures only 70-80 on
13 mcg of Dopamine.  EP service was called and A pace
terminated the AVR with burst pacing and pressures
immediately increased to 110-120 systolic.  Dopamine was then
slowly weaned off over the next several days and the patient
was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit on [**2814-10-31**].
During this time the patient's hematocrit dropped from 30
down to 25.9.  She was transfused with one unit of blood and
her hematocrit increased to 31.6.  The patient remained in
stable condition until the night of [**2814-11-2**] when at 12:30 in
the morning house staff was called to see Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] for
assistance and management of acute respiratory distress.  She
was found to have heart rates 100 to 110, systolic blood
pressures 160's, respiratory rate in the 40's, SAO2 85% on
100% non rebreather with jugular venous pulses increased in
the neck to 10 cm and crackles and rhonchi throughout with
retracting and paradoxical breathing.  EKG at that time
showed AV dissociation, atrial rate of about 80, ventricular
rate of about 100, wide left bundle branch block type with a
left axis.  The patient was given Lasix 60 mg, Morphine
Sulfate 2 mg IV, IV Nitroglycerin drip was started.  She was
given another 2 mg of Morphine Sulfate and 120 mg of Lasix
IV.  With this, her SAO2 increased to 95% on 100% non
rebreather and respiratory rate decreased now to 20 with only
retracting during breathing and no paradoxical.  The patient
was transferred to an ICU setting for non invasive
monitoring.  She was continued with preload reduction with
Nitrates and Morphine and diuresis.  We discussed the use of
mechanical ventilation intervention with her and she does not
want this as previously discussed during this admission with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1357**], even if likely temporary under any circumstances.
Electrophysiology service was called at 2:30 a.m. on [**11-2**]
and they were able to burst pace her AICD which showed
immediate response in blood pressure to SVTs of 100 and it
was decided to continue Amiodarone.  No further Lasix was
given.  The patient continued to put out good urine.  Later
the following morning the patient was seen by the EP service
fellow again.  He attempted to program the ICD to detect 90
beats per minute, however, the algorithm would not permit
rate less than 100 beats per minute.  He changed VT detection
to 100 beats per minute, programmed 19 algorithms followed by
a 10 joule cardioversion.  He decreased V fib detection from
320 milliseconds to 340 milliseconds, activated all SVT
detection algorithms.  PA and lateral chest x-ray was
performed during the day showing no pneumonia, no effusion
and some resolution of congestive heart failure.
Electrolytes were checked and abnormalities were corrected
and it was planned that if an AIVR, slow V tach returned,
that Lidocaine would be used intravenously to assess class IB
anti-arrhythmic efficiency.  This may provide support to
combine Amiodarone and Mexiletine in future if efficacious.
Following these adjustments and the biventricular pacer, the
patient remained stable, continued to diurese well with no
further episodes of AIVR or VT.  During this time afterload
reduction was introduced with Captopril 6.25 mg tid.  This
was changed on [**2814-11-3**] to Zestril 5 mg per day and preload
reduction was added with Lasix 40 mg per day.  It was felt
that preload and afterload reduction would help prevent the
patient from decompensating into congestive heart failure so
rapidly should the AIVR slow VT return.  It was decided not
to add any other anti-arrhythmics at this time and the
ability of the AICD to defibrillate V tach, V fib would not
be tested during this admission.  The patient continued to do
well, her respiratory status improved so that she was
saturating 98% on room air.  She was cleared by physical
therapy for discharge to home and she will follow-up in two
weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1357**] of cardiology and with the
electrophysiology service device clinic.  Appointment times
remain to be determined.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lasix 40 mg per day, Zestril 5 mg per
day, Protonix 40 mg per day, Amiodarone 400 mg per day times
three months and then 200 mg per day, Lipitor 10 mg per day,
Timoptic 0.5% one drop each eye per day, Colace 100 mg po
bid, Aspirin 81 mg per day.  It was elected not to start
anticoagulation or beta blockade at this time and this will
be followed up on her visit with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1357**] in two weeks.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  DNR, DNI.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Ventricular arrhythmia.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

     CHEST (PORTABLE AP)                                             Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 3747**]
     Reason: eval for infiltrate/CHF
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      81 year old woman with VT s/p mulitiple ablations. ICD placement on [**10-27**]
      complicated by difficult access and hypotension
       
      Now with acute hypoxia and increased work of breathing.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      eval for infiltrate/CHF
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: V-tach status post multiple ablations ICD placement on [**10-27**]
     complicated by -------- and hypotension, now with acute hypoxia and increased
     work of breathing. Question infiltrate CHF.
     
     Chest, single AP view.
     
     There is patchy alveolar opacity diffusely in both lungs, new compared with
     three days earlier. There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle. The
     left costophrenic angle is not included on the film. There is mild to moderate
     cardiomegaly --  the cardiac borders are obscured by the parenchymal
     abnormality. A right IJ central line is present --  the tip is obscured, but
     likely lies over the mid SVC. The left sided dual lead ICD is present, with
     lead tips over right atrium and right ventricle. The left hemidiaphragm is
     slightly elevated, similar to [**2814-10-29**].
     
     IMPRESSION: Patchy alveolar opacities in both lungs, with blunting of right
     costophrenic angle. Findings are most suggestive of pulmonary edema, in the
     appropriate clinical setting, infection or ARDS could also give rise to this
     appearance.

     Reason: pulmonary edema vs. infiltrate
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      81 year old woman with VT s/p mulitiple ablations. ICD placement on [**10-27**]
      complicated by difficult access and hypotension.  Seen w/ acute hypoxia and
      increased work of breathing last night, clinically improving this AM.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      pulmonary edema vs. infiltrate
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: ICD placement. Hypoxia last nite.
     
     CHEST, SINGLE VIEW:  Comparison study dated [**2814-11-1**]. There is an unfolded
     aorta. Dual chamber pacemaker without interval change. Right IJ line with its
     tip in the SVC but is partially obstructed by dual chamber pacer leads. There
     is no pneumothorax. There is inteval decrease in diffuse linear alveolar
     opacities. There is a small left pleural effusion.
     
     IMPRESSION: Near complete interval resolution of heart failure.
