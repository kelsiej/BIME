Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**] 
Chief Complaint:
syncope and bright red blood per rectum
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

 
History of Present Illness:
86yo male with gastrointestinal stromal tumor diagnosed in 
[**2769-11-3**] after he presented with a lower GI bleed and was 
found to have a 17x17 cm abdominal mass, with a negative EGD and 
colonoscopy.  He required multiple transfusions at that time, 
and was started on gleevec, which was subsequently stopped 
secondary to lower extremity edema and diarrhea.  It was 
restarted on [**4-3**], with some shrinkage in tumor.  He was then 
readmitted to [**Hospital1 83**] on [**2770-4-15**] after he presented with  bright 
red blood per rectum.  He was admitted to the MICU, and 
transfused as needed.  No further oncologic management was felt 
necessary, nor possible, and he was subsequently transferred to 
the regular floor with the goal of comfort and support with 
blood transfusions until the rest of his family arrived.  
 
Past Medical History:
GIST-unresectable, manifested with LGIB
RBBB

Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 11218**] was transferred to the floor with the 
goal of comfort and blood transfusions and fluid as needed for 
support until further family members could arrive.  He received 
multiple transfusions as he was having [**2-5**] large bloody bowel 
movements per day.  He required approximately [**1-7**] 
transfusions/day.  On [**4-23**], a family meeting was held at which 
time it was decided to withdraw support with the feeling that he 
would pass away within hours, and with a change in the goals of 
care to comfort, with no further support with transfusions, etc. 
 After withdrawing support, he was placed on multiple 
medications for comfort, and became unresponsive.  He remained 
alive for days longer than the team  had anticipated.  He 
continually appeared comfortable, and was intermittently 
tachypnic, requiring morphine.

The patient passed away on [**4-29**] at 2:30 am.  His family was at 
his bedside and he appeared comfortable throughout.

     HISTORY:  Bright red blood per rectum. 
      
     INTERPRETATION:  Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells 
     labeled with Tc-99m, blood flow and delayed images of the abdomen for 130 
     minutes were obtained. 
      
     Blood flow images show a central area of photopenia with normal perfusion in the
     periphery of the abdomen (consistent with the known large GI stromal tumor). 
      
     Delayed blood pool images show a large central area of photopenia with no
     abnormal accumulation of radiotracer. 
      
     The one hour delayed image again demonstrates the abdominal mass and normal
     genital activity.  No evidence of active GI bleed noted. 
      
     IMPRESSION:  No active GI bleed seen.  The findings were discussed with the IR
     team.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  An 86-year-old male with gastrointestinal stromal tumor, with
     significant GI bleeding.  The patient is not a surgical candidate but is
     hemodynamically unstable.
     
     REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 5078**].
     
     INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGIST:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 513**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], radiology
     resident, assisted in the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was described to the patient and
     informed consent was obtained.  Access was gained into the right femoral
     artery.  A 5-French sheath was then placed, followed by advancement of a C2
     glide catheter into the superior mesenteric artery.  There is significant
     shift of the superior mesenteric artery from the large (greater than 15 cm in
     diameter) GI stromal tumor.  Arteriograms from the proximal superior
     mesenteric artery demonstrate significant mass effect from the tumor, with
     large vessels feeding the circumference of the tumor and anastomosing in the
     region of the ascending colon/hepatic flexure.  Delayed imaging of these
     vessels demonstrates a tumor blush over the right lateral aspect of the tumor,
     appearing to co-exist with the hepatic flexure.
     
     Selective inferior mesenteric arteriogram was then performed using a 4-French
     SOS catheter.  This demonstrated no evidence for vascular malformation or
     extravasation involving the sigmoid colon or rectum.  The descending colon did
     not adequately opacify with these images.
     
     We then decided to performed subselective catheterization of superior
     mesenteric branch vessels in an attempt to further delineate the
     neovascularity and possible extravasation.  Third order branch vessels of the
     SMA both cranial and caudal to the tumor were selected, and supraselective
     arteriograms were performed from each of these.  This demonstrated a large
     tumor blush, as well as what appears to be colonic invasion by the tumor.  The
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     segment of colon involved appears to extend approximately 10 cm, and therefore
     in order to treat this segment, both vessels would have to be embolized.  The
     risk of infarction of bowel was then discussed with the attending physician,
     [**Name10 (NameIs) **] it was decided to terminate the procedure.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Suparselective superior mesenteric arteriogram suggesting that
     the 15 cm GI stromal tumor has invaded into the right colon for a segment of
     approximately 10 cm.  Embolization of this segment of bowel would almost
     certainly lead to infarction, infection and sepsis.  No intervention was
     therefore performed.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  An 86-year-old male with gastrointestinal stromal tumor, with
     significant GI bleeding.  The patient is not a surgical candidate but is
     hemodynamically unstable.
     
     REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 5078**].
     
     INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGIST:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 513**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], radiology
     resident, assisted in the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was described to the patient and
     informed consent was obtained.  Access was gained into the right femoral
     artery.  A 5-French sheath was then placed, followed by advancement of a C2
     glide catheter into the superior mesenteric artery.  There is significant
     shift of the superior mesenteric artery from the large (greater than 15 cm in
     diameter) GI stromal tumor.  Arteriograms from the proximal superior
     mesenteric artery demonstrate significant mass effect from the tumor, with
     large vessels feeding the circumference of the tumor and anastomosing in the
     region of the ascending colon/hepatic flexure.  Delayed imaging of these
     vessels demonstrates a tumor blush over the right lateral aspect of the tumor,
     appearing to co-exist with the hepatic flexure.
     
     Selective inferior mesenteric arteriogram was then performed using a 4-French
     SOS catheter.  This demonstrated no evidence for vascular malformation or
     extravasation involving the sigmoid colon or rectum.  The descending colon did
     not adequately opacify with these images.
     
     We then decided to performed subselective catheterization of superior
     mesenteric branch vessels in an attempt to further delineate the
     neovascularity and possible extravasation.  Third order branch vessels of the
     SMA both cranial and caudal to the tumor were selected, and supraselective
     arteriograms were performed from each of these.  This demonstrated a large
     tumor blush, as well as what appears to be colonic invasion by the tumor.  The
                                                                 (Over)

     segment of colon involved appears to extend approximately 10 cm, and therefore
     in order to treat this segment, both vessels would have to be embolized.  The

     certainly lead to infarction, infection and sepsis.  No intervention was

     INDICATION:  An 86-year-old male with gastrointestinal stromal tumor, with
     significant GI bleeding.  The patient is not a surgical candidate but is
     hemodynamically unstable.
     
     REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 5078**].
     
     INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGIST:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 513**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], radiology
     resident, assisted in the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was described to the patient and
     informed consent was obtained.  Access was gained into the right femoral
     artery.  A 5-French sheath was then placed, followed by advancement of a C2
     glide catheter into the superior mesenteric artery.  There is significant
     shift of the superior mesenteric artery from the large (greater than 15 cm in
     diameter) GI stromal tumor.  Arteriograms from the proximal superior
     mesenteric artery demonstrate significant mass effect from the tumor, with
     large vessels feeding the circumference of the tumor and anastomosing in the
     region of the ascending colon/hepatic flexure.  Delayed imaging of these
     vessels demonstrates a tumor blush over the right lateral aspect of the tumor,
     appearing to co-exist with the hepatic flexure.
     
     Selective inferior mesenteric arteriogram was then performed using a 4-French
     SOS catheter.  This demonstrated no evidence for vascular malformation or
     extravasation involving the sigmoid colon or rectum.  The descending colon did
     not adequately opacify with these images.
     
     We then decided to performed subselective catheterization of superior
     mesenteric branch vessels in an attempt to further delineate the
     neovascularity and possible extravasation.  Third order branch vessels of the
     SMA both cranial and caudal to the tumor were selected, and supraselective

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Massive GI bleeding, non-resectable GI stromal tumor.  
      
     INTERPRETATION:  Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells 
     labeled with Tc-99m, blood flow and dynamic images of the abdomen for 130   
     minutes were obtained.  Lateral views of the abdomen were also obtained. 
      
     Blood flow images again demonstrate a central area of photopenia surrounded by a
     rim of hyperperfusion, consistent with the patient's known large GI stromal
     tumor. 
      
     Dynamic images over the abdomen demonstrate intense accumulation of radiotracer,
     which appears to originate in the distal transverse colon with antegrade and
     retrograde flow seen. 
      
     IMPRESSION:  Active GI bleeding, consistent with a source originating in the
     distal transverse colon.  Results were discussed with the interventional and
     clinical team immediately following completion of study.

     SOS catheter.  This demonstrated no evidence for vascular malformation or
     extravasation involving the sigmoid colon or rectum.  The descending colon did
     not adequately opacify with these images.
     
     We then decided to performed subselective catheterization of superior
     mesenteric branch vessels in an attempt to further delineate the
     neovascularity and possible extravasation.  Third order branch vessels of the
     SMA both cranial and caudal to the tumor were selected, and supraselective
     arteriograms were performed from each of these.  This demonstrated a large
     tumor blush, as well as what appears to be colonic invasion by the tumor.  The

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      86 year old man with GIST, massive GIB and no further onc mgt.  Not a surgical 
      candidate, but alert and hemodynamically unstable.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      id vessel for ?embolization for gi bleed

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  An 86-year-old male with gastrointestinal stromal tumor, with
     significant GI bleeding.  The patient is not a surgical candidate but is
     hemodynamically unstable.
     
     REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 5078**].
     
     INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGIST:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 513**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], radiology
     resident, assisted in the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was described to the patient and
     informed consent was obtained.  Access was gained into the right femoral
     artery.  A 5-French sheath was then placed, followed by advancement of a C2
     glide catheter into the superior mesenteric artery.  There is significant
     shift of the superior mesenteric artery from the large (greater than 15 cm in
     diameter) GI stromal tumor.  Arteriograms from the proximal superior
     mesenteric artery demonstrate significant mass effect from the tumor, with
     large vessels feeding the circumference of the tumor and anastomosing in the
     region of the ascending colon/hepatic flexure.  Delayed imaging of these
     vessels demonstrates a tumor blush over the right lateral aspect of the tumor,
     appearing to co-exist with the hepatic flexure.
     
     Selective inferior mesenteric arteriogram was then performed using a 4-French
     SOS catheter.  This demonstrated no evidence for vascular malformation or
     extravasation involving the sigmoid colon or rectum.  The descending colon did
     not adequately opacify with these images.
     
     We then decided to performed subselective catheterization of superior
     mesenteric branch vessels in an attempt to further delineate the
     neovascularity and possible extravasation.  Third order branch vessels of the
     SMA both cranial and caudal to the tumor were selected, and supraselective
     arteriograms were performed from each of these.  This demonstrated a large
     tumor blush, as well as what appears to be colonic invasion by the tumor.  The
                                                                 (Over)
