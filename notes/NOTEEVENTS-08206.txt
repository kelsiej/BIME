CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2555-8-14**] 5:56 PM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: Eval. s/p decompressing craniectomy 

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
74 year old man s/p craniectomy for SDH 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Eval. s/p decompressing craniectomy 
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATIONS: 74-year-old man status post craniotomy on the same 
day for subdural hematoma. Trauma transfer patient.

COMPARISON: Outside head CT dated [**2555-8-14**], 10:24 a.m. 
on the same day.

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.

FINDINGS: The patient is status post left frontooccipital 
craniotomy with an open bony defect. There is persistent 
intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left frontal lobe, along the 
anterior left cranial fossa floor. A more lateral hemorrhage 
measures 1.8 cm in diameter. There is mild-to-moderate 
persistent left falcine herniation as well as effacement of the 
suprasellar cistern, which is persistent and mass effect on the 
left cerebellar peduncle. Since the prior study, there is a new 
hypodense region in most of the left posterior communicating 
artery territory consistent with a recent infarction. Although 
there is considerable mass effect on the left lateral ventricle 
it remains open.

The sphenoid sinus is opacified, and there is mucosal thickening 
in the ethmoid and left maxillary sinus. This could be seen in 
intubation. There is fluid in the left mastoid air cells and a 
nondisplaced transverse mastoid fracture as well. In the skull 
base, there is a slightly comminuted fracture adjacent to the 
left hypoglossal canal. There are also numerous minimally 
displaced fractures through the occiput without significant 
displacement. Please see the cervical spine CT of the same day 
also for further discussion.

IMPRESSION:

1. Status post craniotomy with open flap.

2. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage with mass effect in the left 
frontal lobe.

3. New appearance of left posterior communicating artery 
infarct.

4. Occipital bone fractures, including fractures of the left 
hypoglossal canal and in the mastoid bone on the left. Findings 
were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 9:50 p.m. on the same day.

NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: A subdural hematoma is also 
present in the posterior fossa, just posterior to the right 
cerebellar hemisphere. This measures approximately 1.1cm from 
the inner table. There is a linear nondisplaced fracture in the 
occipital bone overlying the hemorrhage. The fourth ventricle 
remains patent.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2555-8-14**] 5:01 PM

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST

Reason: WITHOUT CONTRAST - please eval for intraabdominal 
injury. Pl

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
76 year old man s/p fall from height, big SDH s/p decompressive 
craniectomy 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
WITHOUT CONTRAST - please eval for intraabdominal injury. Please 
do recons for T/L/S spine 
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATIONS: 76-year-old man status post fall with subdural 
hematoma status post decompressive craniotomy. Evaluate for 
intra-abdominal injury.

COMPARISONS: None.

TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis 
were obtained without intravenous contrast. Intravenous contrast 
was not administered at the request of the referring physician. 
[**Name10 (NameIs) 11346**] and coronal reconstructions were also performed.

CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a Swan-Ganz catheter 
terminating in the proximal main pulmonary artery. There are 
coronary artery calcifications. There is a nasogastric tube 
terminating in the antrum of the stomach. The patient is 
intubated. Evaluation of the mediastinal structures is limited 
without intravenous contrast. There is a small right pleural 
effusion of low density.

There is collapse of the left lower lobe with an abrupt cut-off 
in the left lower lobe bronchus, suspicious for mucous plugging. 
Discoid atelectasis present in the right lower lobe. Otherwise, 
the lungs appear clear.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Within the limitations of 
a non- contrast study, the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, 
adrenal glands are within normal limits. There is a 4 cm 
diameter simple cyst in the lower pole of the right kidney. In 
the right kidney there is a small round exophytic lesion of 
intermediate density, 11 mm in diameter, which is indeterminate. 
Splenic artery calcifications are noted. The stomach, small and 
large bowel are within normal limits. The aorta and the iliac 
arteries are densely calcified.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a Foley catheter 
in the bladder with associated air. The prostate, seminal 
vesicles, sigmoid and rectum are unremarkable. There is no 
lymphadenopathy or free fluid.

BONE WINDOWS: There is an avulsion fracture, with slight 
comminution, along the posterior left iliac [**Doctor First Name 456**]. No other 
fracture is identified.

IMPRESSION:

1. Collapse of left lower lobe, with abrupt cut-off in the 
related airway. Appearance is suspicious for atelectasis with 
mucous plugging.

2. An 11 mm indeterminate lesion in the left kidney. When 
clinically stable, this lesion could be evaluated further with 
ultrasound or cross sectional imaging with contrast in order to 
exclude a small enhancing neoplasm.

3. Fracture of the left ilium with associated hematoma in the 
overlying subcutaneous tissues.

Findings discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on the same evening.

Reason: F/U SDH S/P EVAC, HX. FALL FROM HEIGHT

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
74 year old man s/p craniectomy and IPH. 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
F/U exam 
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Craniectomy. Follow up.

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Comparison with [**2555-8-15**], 6:01 
a.m. Again seen is left to right midline shift, approximately 4 
mm, similar in appearance to the previous examination. The 
amount of intracranial subdural hemorrhage in the region of 
craniectomy on the left is similar, measuring approximately 11 
mm. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left frontal lobe and 
extensive hypodensity in the left occipital lobe is again noted. 
Also seen is the epidural hematoma in the medial right 
cerebellar hemisphere. Slightly increased opacification of 
several ethmoid air cells is again noted. A small amount of 
fluid in both maxillary sinuses is noted. Again seen are changes 
of left craniotomy, with air outlining the left temporal tip, 
smaller than previous. Staples are again seen overlying the 
cranectomy defect.

IMPRESSION: No significant interval change.

CT L-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2555-8-16**] 10:35 AM

CT L-SPINE W/O CONTRAST; CT T-SPINE W/O CONTRAST

Reason: FALL FROM HEIGHT, EVALUATE FOR THORACIC, LUMBAR FX

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
74 year old man with fall from height, subdural, s/p evac 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval Lumbo-sacral spine for fracture 
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 74-year-old man status post fall and subdural 
hematoma. Back pain.

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT images are obtained through the 
thoracic and lumbar spine. Coronal and sagittal reformatted 
images were obtained.

THORACIC SPINE: There is no evidence for fracture or 
malalignment of the thoracic spine. The vertebral bodies are 
normal in height. There are mild degenerative changes in the 
form of osteophytes, most prominently at T8-T9 and T10-T11. 
Schmorl's nodes are seen at T11 and T12. Posterior rib fractures 
are seen at T5 and T6 level on the left. Additionally, there are 
large bilateral pleural effusions with associated subsegmental 
atelectasis at the bilateral lung bases. The visualized aorta 
contains atherosclerotic calcifications. Within the visualized 
abdomen, the right kidney contains a large hypodense rounded 
focus in the mid pole with a rim of calcification. This was 
better evaluated on the CT torso of [**2555-8-14**] but probably 
represents a simple renal cyst.

LUMBAR SPINE: Again, there is no evidence of vertebral body 
fracture or malalignment. Degenerative changes are seen at 
L4-L5. Again, within the surrounding soft tissues, 
calcifications are seen within the aorta. A fracture is 
identified of the left iliac [**Doctor First Name 456**] with an adjacent posterior 
hematoma.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence for lumbar spine fracture or malalignment. 
Degenerative changes as described above.
2. Fractures through the left pelvis iliac [**Doctor First Name 456**] with an adjacent 
posterior hematoma.
3. Large bilateral pleural effusions within the visualized lung 
fields.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
Head CT on admission shown a large left subdural with 
intraparenchymal hemorrhage with about 2 cm midline shift and 
sub pulse in herniation. He was taken emergently to the 
operating room by the neurosurgery team for a Left craniotomy 
and evacuation left of subdural hematoma and intraparenchymal 
hemorrhage.  Post-operatively he was tranfused to maintain his 
hematocrit above 30 and INR < 1.4. Mannitor and permissive 
hypercarbia were continued. His neurologic exam was very poor 
with decerebrate posturing and a GCS of 3T. The severity of his 
injuries were discussed frankly with his family. His 
hypertension was controlled with a nipride drip and tube feeds 
were started via a OG tube. On [**2555-8-16**] the family opted to make 
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6127**] [**Last Name (Titles) 11347**] while awaiting out of town family to arrive. 
Multiple indepth discussions were had between the family and the 
neurosurgery staff regarding his grave prognosis. In accordance 
with the patient's and family's wishes, he was extubated and 
made CMO on [**2555-8-21**]. Passed away on [**2555-8-21**] at 2130.

     INDICATIONS:  76-year-old man status post fall with subdural hematoma status
     post decompressive craniotomy.  Evaluate for intra-abdominal injury.
     
     COMPARISONS:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial CT images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were obtained
     without intravenous contrast.  Intravenous contrast was not administered at
     the request of the referring physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) 5781**] and coronal reconstructions
     were also performed.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a Swan-Ganz catheter terminating
     in the proximal main pulmonary artery.  There are coronary artery
     calcifications.  There is a nasogastric tube terminating in the antrum of the
     stomach.  The patient is intubated.  Evaluation of the mediastinal structures
     is limited without intravenous contrast.  There is a small right pleural
     effusion of low density.
     
     There is collapse of the left lower lobe with an abrupt cut-off in the left
     lower lobe bronchus, suspicious for mucous plugging.  Discoid atelectasis
     present in the right lower lobe.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Within the limitations of a non-
     contrast study, the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands are
     within normal limits.  There is a 4 cm diameter simple cyst in the lower pole
     of the right kidney.  In the right kidney there is a small round exophytic
     lesion of intermediate density, 11 mm in diameter, which is indeterminate.
     Splenic artery calcifications are noted.  The stomach, small and large bowel
     are within normal limits.  The aorta and the iliac arteries are densely
     calcified.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is a Foley catheter in the
     bladder with associated air.  The prostate, seminal vesicles, sigmoid and
     rectum are unremarkable.  There is no lymphadenopathy or free fluid.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There is an avulsion fracture, with slight comminution, along
     the posterior left iliac [**Doctor First Name 2055**]. No other fracture is identified.

     INDICATIONS:  74-year-old man status post craniotomy with subdural hematoma
     status post evacuation.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Correlation with head CT of the same day.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial non-contrast CT images of the cervical spine were obtained,
     and sagittal and coronal reconstructions were also performed.
     
     FINDINGS:  The presence of multiple minimally displaced fractures involving
     the occiput is discussed in the accompanying head CT report of the same day.
     Associated with these fractures is partial subluxation, at the articulations,
     on the left side, between C1 and the occiput, and C1 and C2.  There is slight
     leftward lateral displacement of C2 with respect to C1, without evidence of
     cervical spine fracture.
     
     These abnormalities do not seem to affect the thecal sac, although there may
     be associated ligamentous injury at the skull base which cannot be
     characterized here.  The overall alignment of the cervical spine is preserved
     without listhesis.
     
     There are multilevel mild degenerative changes.  There is also a prominent
     osteophyte along the right lateral margin of the C3 and C4 vertebral bodies at
     the uncovertebral joint.  At this point there is slight mass effect on the
     left vertebral artery foramen, but this appearance is felt likely due to a
     degenerative etiology.
     
     The soft tissue windows also show an extraaxial hemorrhage in the right
     posterior cranial fossa immediately above the transverse sinus. It is not
     readily apparent on the prior outside CT.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Partial subluxation of the lateral masses of C1 and C2, and of C1 with the
     occiput, presumably related to adjacent occipital bone injuries, discussed in
     more detail in report of the head CT of the same day.
     
     2.  Cervical spondylosis.
     
     3.  Extraaxial hemorrhage in the posterior cranial fossa.  This is adjacent to
     a prominent fracture line in the occiput.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW:  The right posterior epidural hematoma is
     again identified.  Please see the head CT report of [**2555-8-15**].
     
     One of the nondisplaced occipital fractures extends into the left occipital
     condyle.
     
     The patient is rotated about the atlanto-axial joint.  I have performed
     oblique coronal reconstructions on the GE Advantage Workstation and have saved
     selected images as series 103a (atlanto-occipital), 103b/c (atlantoaxial).
     Based upon the oblique coronal reconstructions, the degree of subluxation
     about the occipital condyle/C1, and C1/C2 appears exaggerated on the original
     reconstructions. There is, however, some minimal widening of the medial left
     atlanto- axial articulation (103b image 4) as well as the left atlanto-
     occipital joint (103a image 7).  No significant subluxation is identified.

     Reason: S/P FALL, CRANIECTOMY.
     Admitting Diagnosis: FALL
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      74 year old man s/p fall, s/p decompressive craniectomy.                        
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      For 6am please. Eval. for interval change                                       
     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Patient status post fall and decompressed craniectomy.  Evaluate
     for interval change.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2555-8-14**] at 18:27.
     
     NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN:  It is noted that the patient received IV contrast
     last evening for torso examination.  The patient is status post left frontal
     decompressed craniectomy.  There is slightly more acute subdural blood on the
     left in the area of the craniectomy site, now measuring about 1 cm in
     thickness.  There is also a small amount of hyperdensity seen within the right
     frontal subdural space, consistent with acute hemorrhage.  There is an similar
     amount of acute subdural blood along the falx cerebri, and likely a similar
     amount of acute blood in the subdural space layering along the tentorium.
     There is a similar degree of left to right shift of normally midline
     structures, by approximately 6 mm.  Intraparenchymal hemorrhage and
     surrounding edema within the left frontal lobe is not significantly changed. A
     left posterior cerebral artery infarct is also not markedly changed from
     18:27.  There is heterogeneous density of this infarcted tissue, which could
     reflect enhancement from prior contrast administration or could reflect areas
     of hemorrhage within this infarcted tissue.  The [**Doctor Last Name 30**]-white matter
     differentiation seems relatively preserved within the right cerebral
     hemisphere.  The appearance of the fourth ventricle is unchanged.
     Opacification of left mastoid air cells and fractures through the occipital
     bone, including at least two fracture lines extending through the foramen
     magnum are not significantly changed.  There is partial opacification of the
     visualized paranasal sinuses, possibly related to intubation and/or injury.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No significant change in the degree of intraparenchymal and
     subdural hemorrhage in the locations described.  No significant change in the
     leftward subfalcine herniation compared to 18:27 yesterday.  Heterogeneous
     density within the left posterior cerebral infarct may reflect small areas of
     hemorrhage or contrast enhancement from contrast administered yesterday.
     
     NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW:  The hematoma seen posterior to the right
     cerebellar hemisphere is better characterized on this examination.  It
     represents epidural blood as the blood extends from the infratentorial
     epidural space to the supratentorial epidural space.  This particular
     hematoma does not layer into the tentorium, confirming its epidural
     location.  The size of this hematoma is unchanged from the prior examination.
     As before, a nondisplaced fracture is seen superficial to the hematoma.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION:  74-year-old man status post fall and subdural hematoma.  Back
     pain.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT images are obtained through the thoracic and
     lumbar spine.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.
     
     THORACIC SPINE:  There is no evidence for fracture or malalignment of the
     thoracic spine.  The vertebral bodies are normal in height.  There are mild
     degenerative changes in the form of osteophytes, most prominently at T8-T9 and
     T10-T11.  Schmorl's nodes are seen at T11 and T12.  Posterior rib fractures
     are seen at T5 and T6 level on the left.  Additionally, there are large
     bilateral pleural effusions with associated subsegmental atelectasis at the
     bilateral lung bases.  The visualized aorta contains atherosclerotic
     calcifications.  Within the visualized abdomen, the right kidney contains a
     large hypodense rounded focus in the mid pole with a rim of calcification.
     This was better evaluated on the CT torso of [**2555-8-14**] but probably represents a
     simple renal cyst.
     
     LUMBAR SPINE:  Again, there is no evidence of vertebral body fracture or
     malalignment.  Degenerative changes are seen at L4-L5.  Again, within the
     surrounding soft tissues, calcifications are seen within the aorta.  A
     fracture is identified of the left iliac [**Doctor First Name 2055**] with an adjacent posterior
     hematoma.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No evidence for lumbar spine fracture or malalignment.  Degenerative

      74 year old man with ICH s/p fall s/po caniotomy                                
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      eval for interval change

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  74-year-old man status post fall with intracranial hemorrhage,
     status post craniotomy.
     
     COMPARISON:  Non-contrast head CT [**2555-8-16**].
     
     FINDINGS:  Status post left frontal craniotomy. There is a large hyperdense
     focus of acute hemorrhage within the left frontal region which is similar in
     size and positioning and again contains a rim of hypodensity.  There is a
     small focus of air seen anteriorly consistent with prior craniotomy.  Just
     deep to the craniotomy defect is again seen a hyperdense subdural hematoma
     measuring 12 mm which is similar in size and appearance.  Again seen is 4-mm
     of left-to-right midline shift.  Also similar in size and appearance is an
     evolving hypodensity in the left occipital lobe as well as within the medial
     aspect of the right occipital lobe.  These occipital lobe lesions are most
     likely secondary to evolving infarction from posterior cerebral artery
     impingement following the patient's initial injury. There is no evidence of
     herniation or hydrocephalus.  There is a small focus of subarachnoid
     hemorrhage in the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 234**] of the right lateral ventricle.  The
     surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are stable. Again seen are
     fractures through the skull base extending through the left mastoid air cells.
     The visualized paranasal sinuses show opacification of the ethmoid air cells
     and minimal mucosal thickening of the bilateral maxillary sinuses.  The
     visualized frontal sinuses are clear.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No significant interval change in the size and appearance of the left
     frontal acute intracranial hemorrhage with 4-mm of left-to-right midline shift
     and 12-mm subdural hemorrhage lying deep to the craniotomy defect.
     
     2.  Stable large left and medium right occipital hypodensities which most
     likely represent evolving infarctions in this region from posterior cerebral
     artery impingement after the initial acute injury and subsequent herniation.
