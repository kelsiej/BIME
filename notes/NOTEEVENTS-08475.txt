Admission Date:  [**3347-9-27**]     Discharge Date: [**3347-11-8**]

Date of Birth:   [**3269-10-23**]     Sex:  F

Service:

Patient was taken to the OR for exploratory laparotomy on
[**3347-10-16**].  The exploratory laparotomy revealed the omentum to
be cemented into the anterior abdominal wall, small bowel and
large bowel.  She also had bloody ascites and diaphragmatic
studding and unresectable disease.  Frozen section showed
poorly differentiated carcinoma.

Postoperative attempts to extubate patient were unsuccessful.
Therefore, the patient was transferred to the SICU.
Patient's respiratory distress was attributed to multiple
reasons including CHF, pneumonia, and also large pleural
effusion.  Patient had a chest tube placed on [**3347-10-21**], which
exudative pleural effusion was drained.  Patient had no
improvement in pulmonary status.  Patient was found to have a
non-Q-wave myocardial infarction.

An echocardiogram near that time showed a reduced EF of 25%.
Patient was continued on broad-spectrum antibiotics because
of possible pneumonia.  She was also continued on lepirudin
for her DVT.  During the hospital course, her hematocrit
trended down requiring multiple transfusions.

On [**3347-10-23**], patient developed increasing fevers,
hypotension.  She was presumed to be septic from possible
intraabdominal source.  The patient was switched to Zosyn.
Patient had worsening edema with increasing anasarca from
repetitive fluid boluses.  Patient was made DNR on [**10-24**].

Attempts to wean patient continued to be unsuccessful.
Attempts to diurese were also unsuccessful with Lasix and
Zaroxolyn.  Team had several family meetings and on [**3347-11-6**],
family decided that patient would not want further
transfusions, antibiotics, or blood draws.  Pressors were
discontinued.  Patient's blood pressure gradually trended
down.  Patient expired on [**3347-11-8**].

Family did not want an autopsy.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      77 year old woman with peritoneal carcinomatosis, metastatic ca, and DVT on

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: 77-year-old woman with peritoneal carcinomatosis, metastatic
     carcinoma, and right-sided DVT on Leuperidin. Patient was scheduled for
     surgical debulking on Friday. Needs IVC filter placement.
     
     REFERRING PHYSICIAN: [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name7 (NamePattern1) 648**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8065**].
     
     RADIOLOGIST: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 851**], Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 513**] attending radiologist
     present and supervised throughout the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE: The procedure was described to the patient and informed consent was
     obtained. Patient was placed supine on the angiographic table with the right
     groin prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Under ultrasonic
     guidance through an anesthetized skin approach a 19 gauge single wall puncture
     needle was accessed to the right common femoral vein. [**Last Name (un) 223**] wire was
     advanced through the distal inferior vena cava. The puncture needle was then
     exchanged for a 4 Fr sheath. A 4 Fr Omniflush catheter was then advanced
     through the Bentson guidewire. As there is no prior CT done. Inferior vena
     cavogram was performed with the tip of the catheter in left common iliac vein.
     Demonstrated patent inferior vena cava without any duplications and no
     evidence of any thrombi. The location of the renal veins was identified. This
     was followed by advancement of an Optease retrievable inferior vena cava
     filter, placed just inferior to the renal veins. An x-ray was obtained
     following placement documenting the tip to be in optimal position. The
     catheter and the sheath were removed. Pressure was then applied over the right
     groin until hemostasis was achieved.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: None.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful placement of an Retrievable inferior vena cava filter
     just below the renal veins via the right common femoral vein. The filter can
     be removed if desired up to 14 days following placement.
     
     
     
                                                                 (Over)

Addendum to NPN
Over the past several hours, pt has become increasingly more tachypneic and tachycardic, additionally Spo2 dropped from mid 90's into the low 80's.

Pt was then switched back to AC 20x500x0.40/+5, which pt tolerated well and has maintained SpO2 >92% since.
