Echocardiogram:
Conclusions:  
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric 
left  
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. Overall  
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right 
ventricular  
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is 
mildly  
dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3)  
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no 
aortic  
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with 
trivial  
mitral regurgitation. There is a very small pericardial 
effusion.  
.
HISTORY: 46-year-old man with hepatitis C, cirrhosis, failed 
liver transplant, functioning TIPS, admitted for variceal 
bleeding with fever to 101 and abdominal pain.

PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The procedure was performed by Doctors 
[**Name5 (PTitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **], the attending physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3825**] was present and 
supervising. Informed consent was obtained.

Two units of FFP were administered prior to the commencement of 
the procedure due to the patient's elevated INR. Sonographic 
examination demonstrated the largest pocket of ascites to be in 
the left lower quadrant. The left lower abdomen was prepped and 
draped in standard sterile fashion. After infusion of 1% 
lidocaine, a UV needle was advanced under ultrasonographic 
guidance into the pocket. A total of 2.5 liters of 
clear-appearing ascites was aspirated. Samples were sent to the 
laboratory for further examination. The UA needle was removed. 
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there are no 
immediate post-procedure complications.

IMPRESSION: Successful diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis 
of 2.5 liters of clear ascites.
.
CT abdomen:
CONCLUSION:
1) Decompensated cirrhosis with TIPS and extensive varices. The 
splenic vein and left renal vein are both patent and probably 
already a small shunt.
2) No focal abnormality identified within the liver. Some 
slightly asymmetric prostate perfusion should be correlated with 
clinical history.
3) Multiple small bilateral renal cysts. These findings are 
nonspecific but can sometimes be seen in the context of chronic 
lithium therapy.
4) A few small retroperitoneal and periaortic lymph[**MD Number 65**] are 
unlikely to be of significance. Small right-sided lung granuloma 
is chronic.
.
[**2966-3-11**]:
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
TIPS revision 
INDICATION: 46-year-old with failing liver transplant post TIPS. 
Here for TIPS revision.

RADIOLOGIST: Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **], [**Name5 (PTitle) 11966**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 1392**], and [**Doctor Last Name 5215**]. Drs. 
[**Last Name (STitle) 5215**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1392**] were present and supervising throughout the 
procedure.

Comparison is made to CT scan performed [**2966-3-2**].

PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: Right neck was prepped and draped in usual 
sterile fashion. 1% lidocaine was used for local anesthesia. 
Using ultrasonographic guidance, the right internal jugular vein 
was accessed using a 21-gauge micropuncture needle. An 0.018 
guidewire was advanced through the needle into the internal 
jugular vein, and the needle was exchanged for a 4.5-French 
micropuncture sheath. The tract was then dilated with a 7-French 
dilator. The micropuncture sheath and the 0.018 guidewire were 
removed and exchanged for a 7-French sidearm sheath. A 0.035 
[**Doctor Last Name 50**] wire was then advanced into the IVC. The [**Doctor Last Name 50**] was then 
exchanged for initially a 0.035 Glidewire, and then a superstiff 
Glidewire. Multiple catheters including 5Fr Cobra, MPA, and 
Headhunter catheters were used to try and access the right 
hepatic vein and the TIPS catheter without success. Attempts 
were made by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11966**] and both Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1392**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 5215**] multiple 
times without success in accessing the TIPS catheter.

A small amount of contrast was injected through the catheter and 
sheath demonstrating opacification of likely a side branch of 
the right hepatic vein. This was the only branch that could 
consistently be accessed. After approximately 1 hour of repeated 
attempts to access the right hepatic vein branch leading to the 
TIPS, the procedure was aborted.

The 7-French sheath was removed, and a 9-French triple-lumen 
central venous catheter was placed within the neck. However, due 
to persistent oozing at the site of the catheter insertion, this 
was attempted to be exchanged for a 12- French Cordis catheter, 
access was lost and the wire and Cordis was removed. Manual 
pressure was held at the puncture site until hemostasis was 
achieved. The site was dressed with a Syvek patch and an 
Elastoplast pressure dressing.

There were no postprocedure complications, and the patient 
tolerated the procedure well.

MEDICATIONS: 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia, 100mcg Fentanyl, 
3mg Versed.

IMPRESSION:

Unsuccessful TIPS revision as the right hepatic vein and TIPS 
catheter were unable to be accessed. We will plan for a 
percutaneous transhepatic approach directly to the TIPS 
catheter. These findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], the 
housestaff caring for the patient.
.
[**2966-3-12**]:
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
TIPS revision 
HISTORY: Portal hypertension, failed liver transplant, recurrent 
variceal hemorrhage, prior TIPS at outside institution.

PHYSICIANS: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 11967**] [**Last Name (LF) 11966**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] [**Doctor Last Name **], and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 5214**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5215**] 
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5215**], the attending radiologist, being present and 
supervising throughout the procedure.

PROCEDURE: Following written informed consent, the patient was 
positioned supine on the angiography table. A preprocedure 
timeout was performed to confirm patient, procedure, and site. 
Induction of general anesthesia by the anesthesiology service. 
Standard sterile prep and drape of the right base of the neck 
and the abdomen. Local anesthesia with 10 cc of 1% lidocaine 
subcutaneously. Using realtime ultrasound guidance, a 22-gauge 
needle was advanced into the right internal jugular vein. A 
0.018-inch guidewire was advanced through the needle into the 
superior vena cava using fluoroscopic guidance. Needle was 
exchanged for the introducer sheath and then the guidewire was 
exchanged for a 0.035-inch guidewire. The micropuncture sheath 
was exchanged for a 7-French bright-tip vascular sheath, which 
was positioned in the inferior vena cava. Attempts were then 
made to cannulate the right hepatic vein using a SOS Omni 
catheter and guidewire. These were unsuccessful. Therefore, a 
21-gauge needle was used to access the TIPS using a percutaneous 
transhepatic approach through the right lobe of the liver. A 
0.018-inch guidewire was advanced through the needle into the 
right hepatic vein. The needle was exchanged for the Accustick 
sheath and then the guidewire was exchanged for a 0.035-inch 
guidewire, which was positioned in the superior vena cava using 
fluoroscopic guidance. A 25 mm gooseneck snare was used to snare 
the wire from the jugular access and then the right internal 
jugular vein sheath was advanced over the snare guidewire into 
the superior aspect of the TIPS. The guidewire was then pulled 
through the sheath and through-and-through access was obtained. 
The Berenstein catheter was advanced over the guidewire through 
the sheath and then the guidewire was removed. Then, using a new 
guidewire, the distal aspect of the TIPS was accessed from the 
jugular access. The catheter and wire were advanced into the 
splenic vein. Venography was performed from this catheter 
position. This demonstrated patency of the downstream portion of 
the splenic vein, main portal vein, TIPS, right hepatic vein and 
inferior vena cava. Mild narrowing was seen at the superior 
aspect of the TIPS and within the right hepatic vein. 
Hepatopedal flow is visualized in the left portal vein, which is 
patent. The coronary vein is patent and there is reperfusion of 
venous collaterals through the in situ coils with opacification 
of moderate-to-large gastroesophageal varices. Pressures were 
then obtained. The main portal vein pressure was 32 mmHg, the 
inferior aspect of the TIPS was 31 mmHg, mid TIPS was 31 mmHg, 
superior aspect of the TIPS was 30 mmHg, the right hepatic vein 
was 29 mmHg, in the right atrium was 27/22, mean 24 mmHg. Using 
a Cobra catheter, the coronary vein was selected and then a 
tributary of the coronary vein was selected. This was embolized 
with 3 mm x 3 cm stainless steel coils and with a total of 6 mL 
of absolute alcohol. The second tributary of the coronary vein 
was then selected and was embolized with two 4 mm x 3 cm coils 
and with 2 cc of absolute ethanol. Venography of the coronary 
vein was then performed demonstrating patency of the downstream 
portion of the coronary vein, but occlusion of the 2 tributaries 
and no further opacification of the gastroesophageal varices 
arising from the coronary vein. The superior aspect of the TIPS 
and the outflow hepatic vein was then angioplastied with a 12 mm 
x 4 cm angioplasty balloon. Pressure measurements were then 
obtained from the portal vein and the right atrium. The portal 
vein pressure was 32 mmHg and the right atrial pressure was 26 
mmHg. This equates to a portosystemic gradient of 6 mmHg 
post-TIPS revision. The gradient was 8 mmHg pre-revision.

All wires, sheaths and catheters were removed and hemostasis was 
ensured with direct manual compression. General anesthesia was 
reversed by the anesthesiology service and the patient was 
transferred to the PACU in stable condition. There were no 
immediate complications.

IMPRESSION: Revision of the in situ TIPS was performed by 
combination of right internal jugular and percutaneous 
transhepatic access. The TIPS was angioplastied with a 12-mm 
balloon with a decrease in the gradient from 8 mmHg 
pre-treatment to 6 mmHg post-treatment. In addition, 
embolization was performed of 2 separate tributaries of the 
coronary vein, which were supplying gastroesophageal varices.
.
Abdominal U/S:
FINDINGS: The TIPS stent is patent with wall-to-wall flow. 
Velocities in the main portal vein range from 97 to 103 cm/s. 
Velocities in the proximal TIPS stent are 99 and 119 cm/s, in 
the mid stent [**49**] and 105 cm/s, and in the distal stent 136 and 
151 cm/s. The right hepatic vein superior to the TIPS is patent 
with wall- to- wall flow. Evaluation of the directionality of 
the left portal vein is limited.

IMPRESSION: Patent TIPS with wall-to-wall flow and velocities as 
described above.
 
Brief Hospital Course:

(due to noncompliance and substance abuse) who presented with 
variceal bleeding thought secondary to TIPS malfunction.  
.  
# Esophageal and gastric variceal bleeding: Hct stable, Received 
7URBC total from OSH and here, 6 bags plts. Patient had an EGD 
performed which showed varices and portal gastropathy. An 
ultrasound of his liver showed continued patency of his TIPS; 
however, TIPS revision was performed given concern for 
obstruction not seen on ultrasound. A TIPS revision was 
initially performed with unsuccessful cannulation of the TIPS 
catheter, and a repeat revision was successfully performed the 
next day via a transhepatic approach, with decrease in pressures 
from 8mm Hg to 6 mm Hg.

     INDICATION:  Right upper extremity swelling.  Evaluate for DVT.
     
     FINDINGS:  In the region of the right subclavian vein, there are several foci
     of echogenicity within the venous lumen.  This area is difficult to compress
     and therefore this finding is equivocal for a partially occlusive thrombus in
     the right subclavian vein.  The reminder of the exam showed normal flow,
     waveforms, and compressibility.  There is a catheter in the right internal
     jugular vein.

     REPORT.
     
     CT OF LUNG BASES.  
     
     Bibasilar atelectasis is identified with associated pleural effusions.  Mild
     prominence of ventricular walls suggests anemia. Calcified right lower lobe
     granuloma is seen
     
     CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. The liver is somewhat cirrhotic as evidenced by
     enlargement of the left lateral segment, and relative atrophy of the medial
     segment of the right lobe and atrophy of the right lobe.  Such volumetric
     redistribution suggests cirrhosis. There is a TIPS in situ extending from the
     right hepatic vein into the patient's portal vein.  No focal liver lesion is
     identified.  The portal vein is patent but there is a small amount of non-
     occlusive clot just at the portal vein as it is formed from the patient's SMV.
     
     Some of the delineation in this area is limited by streak artifact from
     patient's coils.  Despite this coiling, presumably within the patient's
     coronary vein, massive perisplenic, esophageal and omental varices remain.
     There is significant splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring about 22 cm in
     the craniocaudal plane.  The pancreas appears unremarkable.  There is no
     evidence of focal pancreatic mass and there is no evidence of splenic vein
     thrombosis.  The splenic vein is tortuous and dilated and intimately related
     to the patient's left renal vein.  There does appear to be a spontaneous
     splenorenal shunt between these two vessels already in place.  These can be
                                                                 (Over)

     best appreciated on coronal reformatted images (see series 11, image 32).
     
     CT OF PELVIS:  
     
     Significant ascites is present.  There is some asymmetrical perfusion within
     the prostate.  The prostate size is not increased, but the peripheral zone on
     the left side does not enhances on the right side.  This is a nonspecific
     finding and should be correlated with symptoms and physical examination.
     Symmetrical small renal cysts are seen- nonspecific, but sometimes seen in
     the context of chronic lithium therapy.Correlation with medication history
     recommended.
     Extensive anasarca is identified.
     
     CT OF BONES.
     
     No suspicious lytic or sclerotic abnormality is identified.
     
     MULTIPLANAR REFORMATS.  
     
     Multiplanar reformatted images were useful to evaluate the stent anatomy.  Two
     side by side stents can be appreciated on this examination.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     
     1) Decompensated cirrhosis with TIPS and extensive varices.  The splenic vein
     and left renal vein are both patent and probably already a small shunt.
     
     2)  No focal abnormality identified within the liver.  Some slightly
     asymmetric prostate perfusion should be correlated with clinical history.
     
     3)  Multiple small bilateral renal cysts.  These findings are nonspecific but
     can sometimes be seen in the context of chronic lithium therapy.
     
     4) A few small retroperitoneal and periaortic lymph nodes are unlikely to be
     of significance.  Small right-sided lung granuloma is chronic.

     CT OF LUNG BASES.  
     
     Bibasilar atelectasis is identified with associated pleural effusions.  Mild
     prominence of ventricular walls suggests anemia. Calcified right lower lobe
     granuloma is seen
     
     CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. The liver is somewhat cirrhotic as evidenced by
     enlargement of the left lateral segment, and relative atrophy of the medial
     segment of the right lobe and atrophy of the right lobe.  Such volumetric
     redistribution suggests cirrhosis. There is a TIPS in situ extending from the
     right hepatic vein into the patient's portal vein.  No focal liver lesion is
     identified.  The portal vein is patent but there is a small amount of non-
     occlusive clot just at the portal vein as it is formed from the patient's SMV.
     
     Some of the delineation in this area is limited by streak artifact from
     patient's coils.  Despite this coiling, presumably within the patient's
     coronary vein, massive perisplenic, esophageal and omental varices remain.
     There is significant splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring about 22 cm in
     the craniocaudal plane.  The pancreas appears unremarkable.  There is no
     evidence of focal pancreatic mass and there is no evidence of splenic vein
     thrombosis.  The splenic vein is tortuous and dilated and intimately related
     to the patient's left renal vein.  There does appear to be a spontaneous
     splenorenal shunt between these two vessels already in place.  These can be
                                                                 (Over)

     best appreciated on coronal reformatted images (see series 11, image 32).
     
     CT OF PELVIS:  
     
     Significant ascites is present.  There is some asymmetrical perfusion within
     the prostate.  The prostate size is not increased, but the peripheral zone on
     the left side does not enhances on the right side.  This is a nonspecific
     finding and should be correlated with symptoms and physical examination.
     Symmetrical small renal cysts are seen- nonspecific, but sometimes seen in
     the context of chronic lithium therapy.Correlation with medication history
     recommended.
     Extensive anasarca is identified.
     
     CT OF BONES.
     
     No suspicious lytic or sclerotic abnormality is identified.
     
     MULTIPLANAR REFORMATS.  
     
     Multiplanar reformatted images were useful to evaluate the stent anatomy.  Two
     side by side stents can be appreciated on this examination.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     
     1) Decompensated cirrhosis with TIPS and extensive varices.  The splenic vein
     and left renal vein are both patent and probably already a small shunt.
     
     2)  No focal abnormality identified within the liver.  Some slightly
     asymmetric prostate perfusion should be correlated with clinical history.
     
     3)  Multiple small bilateral renal cysts.  These findings are nonspecific but
     can sometimes be seen in the context of chronic lithium therapy.
     
     4) A few small retroperitoneal and periaortic lymph nodes are unlikely to be
     of significance.  Small right-sided lung granuloma is chronic.

     COMPARISON:  [**2966-3-1**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There is apparent widening of the mediastinal and cardiac
     silhouettes likely secondary to patient positioning.  The tip of a right
     internal jugular venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC.  Moderate
     bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, are unchanged.  There
     are continued patchy ill- defined opacities involving both lung bases.  A more
     focal area of opacity at the left lung base has decreased over the interval.
     No pneumothorax is identified.  A metallic stent is identified in the right
     upper abdominal quadrant.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar opacities which may
     reflect atelectasis, although developing pneumonia cannot be excluded.

     the skin surface.
     
     Pre- and post-PICC ultrasonographic images were obtained.  A final
     fluoroscopic image was also obtained confirming position of the catheter tip
     in the distal SVC.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  1% lidocaine for local anesthesia.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Successful placement of single lumen 47-cm PICC via the left brachial vein
     with its tip in the distal SVC.  The line is ready for use.

      TIPS revision

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  46-year-old with failing liver transplant post TIPS.  Here for
     TIPS revision.
     
     RADIOLOGIST:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 2234**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 41**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 389**], and [**Doctor Last Name 512**].  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 512**] and
     [**Name5 (PTitle) 389**] were present and supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     Comparison is made to CT scan performed [**2966-3-2**].
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  Right neck was prepped and draped in usual sterile
     fashion.  1% lidocaine was used for local anesthesia.  Using ultrasonographic
     guidance, the right internal jugular vein was accessed using a 21-gauge
     micropuncture needle.  An 0.018 guidewire was advanced through the needle into
     the internal jugular vein, and the needle was exchanged for a 4.5-French
     micropuncture sheath.  The tract was then dilated with a 7-French dilator. The
     micropuncture sheath and the 0.018 guidewire were removed and exchanged for a
     7-French sidearm sheath.  A 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name **] wire was then advanced into the IVC.
     The [**Doctor Last Name **] was then exchanged for initially a 0.035 Glidewire, and then a
     superstiff Glidewire.  Multiple catheters including 5Fr Cobra, MPA, and
     Headhunter catheters were used to try and access the right hepatic vein and
     the TIPS catheter without success.  Attempts were made by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 41**] and both
     Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 389**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 512**] multiple times without success in accessing the TIPS
     catheter.
     
     A small amount of contrast was injected through the catheter and sheath
     demonstrating opacification of likely a side branch of the right hepatic vein.
     This was the only branch that could consistently be accessed.  After
     approximately 1 hour of repeated attempts to access the right hepatic vein
     branch leading to the TIPS, the procedure was aborted.
     
     The 7-French sheath was removed, and a 9-French triple-lumen central venous
     catheter was placed within the neck.  However, due to persistent oozing at the
     site of the catheter insertion, this was attempted to be exchanged for a 12-
     French Cordis catheter, access was lost and the wire and Cordis was removed.
     Manual pressure was held at the puncture site until hemostasis was achieved.
                                                                 (Over)

     The site was dressed with a Syvek patch and an Elastoplast pressure dressing.
     
     There were no postprocedure complications, and the patient tolerated the
     procedure well.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  1% lidocaine for local anesthesia, 100mcg Fentanyl, 3mg Versed.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Unsuccessful TIPS revision as the right hepatic vein and TIPS catheter were
     unable to be accessed.  We will plan for a percutaneous transhepatic approach
     directly to the TIPS catheter.  These findings were discussed with Dr.
     [**First Name (STitle) 9313**], the housestaff caring for the patient.

     INDICATION:  46-year-old with failing liver transplant post TIPS.  Here for
     TIPS revision.
     
     RADIOLOGIST:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 2234**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 41**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 389**], and [**Doctor Last Name 512**].  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 512**] and
     [**Name5 (PTitle) 389**] were present and supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     Comparison is made to CT scan performed [**2966-3-2**].
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  Right neck was prepped and draped in usual sterile
     fashion.  1% lidocaine was used for local anesthesia.  Using ultrasonographic
     guidance, the right internal jugular vein was accessed using a 21-gauge
     micropuncture needle.  An 0.018 guidewire was advanced through the needle into
     the internal jugular vein, and the needle was exchanged for a 4.5-French
     micropuncture sheath.  The tract was then dilated with a 7-French dilator. The
     micropuncture sheath and the 0.018 guidewire were removed and exchanged for a
     7-French sidearm sheath.  A 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name **] wire was then advanced into the IVC.
     The [**Doctor Last Name **] was then exchanged for initially a 0.035 Glidewire, and then a
     superstiff Glidewire.  Multiple catheters including 5Fr Cobra, MPA, and
     Headhunter catheters were used to try and access the right hepatic vein and
     the TIPS catheter without success.  Attempts were made by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 41**] and both
     Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 389**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 512**] multiple times without success in accessing the TIPS
     catheter.
     
     A small amount of contrast was injected through the catheter and sheath
     demonstrating opacification of likely a side branch of the right hepatic vein.
     This was the only branch that could consistently be accessed.  After
     approximately 1 hour of repeated attempts to access the right hepatic vein
     branch leading to the TIPS, the procedure was aborted.
     
     The 7-French sheath was removed, and a 9-French triple-lumen central venous
     catheter was placed within the neck.  However, due to persistent oozing at the
     site of the catheter insertion, this was attempted to be exchanged for a 12-
     French Cordis catheter, access was lost and the wire and Cordis was removed.
     Manual pressure was held at the puncture site until hemostasis was achieved.
                                                                 (Over)

     HISTORY:  Portal hypertension, failed liver transplant, recurrent variceal
     hemorrhage, prior TIPS at outside institution.
     
     PHYSICIANS:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 60**] [**Last Name (LF) 41**], [**First Name3 (LF) 3501**] [**Doctor Last Name 2234**], and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 511**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 512**] with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 512**], the attending radiologist, being present and supervising throughout
     the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Following written informed consent, the patient was positioned
     supine on the angiography table.  A preprocedure timeout was performed to
     confirm patient, procedure, and site.  Induction of general anesthesia by the
     anesthesiology service.  Standard sterile prep and drape of the right base of
     the neck and the abdomen.  Local anesthesia with 10 cc of 1% lidocaine
     subcutaneously.  Using realtime ultrasound guidance, a 22-gauge needle was
     advanced into the right internal jugular vein.  A 0.018-inch guidewire was
     advanced through the needle into the superior vena cava using fluoroscopic
     guidance.  Needle was exchanged for the introducer sheath and then the
     guidewire was exchanged for a 0.035-inch guidewire.  The micropuncture sheath
     was exchanged for a 7-French bright-tip vascular sheath, which was positioned
     in the inferior vena cava.  Attempts were then made to cannulate the right
     hepatic vein using a SOS Omni catheter and guidewire.  These were
     unsuccessful.  Therefore, a 21-gauge needle was used to access the TIPS using
     a percutaneous transhepatic approach through the right lobe of the liver.  A
     0.018-inch guidewire was advanced through the needle into the right hepatic
     vein.  The needle was exchanged for the Accustick sheath and then the
     guidewire was exchanged for a 0.035-inch guidewire, which was positioned in
     the superior vena cava using fluoroscopic guidance.  A 25 mm gooseneck snare
     was used to snare the wire from the jugular access and then the right internal
                                                                 (Over)

     jugular vein sheath was advanced over the snare guidewire into the superior
     aspect of the TIPS.  The guidewire was then pulled through the sheath and
     through-and-through access was obtained.  The Berenstein catheter was advanced
     over the guidewire through the sheath and then the guidewire was removed.
     Then, using a new guidewire, the distal aspect of the TIPS was accessed from
     the jugular access.  The catheter and wire were advanced into the splenic
     vein.  Venography was performed from this catheter position.  This
     demonstrated patency of the downstream portion of the splenic vein, main
     portal vein, TIPS, right hepatic vein and inferior vena cava.  Mild narrowing
     was seen at the superior aspect of the TIPS and within the right hepatic vein.
     Hepatopedal flow is visualized in the left portal vein, which is patent.  The
     coronary vein is patent and there is reperfusion of venous collaterals through
     the in situ coils with opacification of moderate-to-large gastroesophageal
     varices.  Pressures were then obtained.  The main portal vein pressure was 32
     mmHg, the inferior aspect of the TIPS was 31 mmHg, mid TIPS was 31 mmHg,
     superior aspect of the TIPS was 30 mmHg, the right hepatic vein was 29 mmHg,
     in the right atrium was 27/22, mean 24 mmHg.  Using a Cobra catheter, the
     coronary vein was selected and then a tributary of the coronary vein was
     selected.  This was embolized with 3 mm x 3 cm stainless steel coils and with
     a total of 6 mL of absolute alcohol.  The second tributary of the coronary
     vein was then selected and was embolized with two 4 mm x 3 cm coils and with 2
     cc of absolute ethanol.  Venography of the coronary vein was then performed
     demonstrating patency of the downstream portion of the coronary vein, but
     occlusion of the 2 tributaries and no further opacification of the
     gastroesophageal varices arising from the coronary vein.  The superior aspect
     of the TIPS and the outflow hepatic vein was then angioplastied with a 12 mm x
     4 cm angioplasty balloon.  Pressure measurements were then obtained from the
     portal vein and the right atrium.  The portal vein pressure was 32 mmHg and
     the right atrial pressure was 26 mmHg.  This equates to a portosystemic
     gradient of 6 mmHg post-TIPS revision.  The gradient was 8 mmHg pre-revision.
     
     All wires, sheaths and catheters were removed and hemostasis was ensured with
     direct manual compression.  General anesthesia was reversed by the
     anesthesiology service and the patient was transferred to the PACU in stable
     condition.  There were no immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Revision of the in situ TIPS was performed by combination of
     right internal jugular and percutaneous transhepatic access.  The TIPS was
     angioplastied with a 12-mm balloon with a decrease in the gradient from 8 mmHg
     pre-treatment to 6 mmHg post-treatment.  In addition, embolization was
     performed of 2 separate tributaries of the coronary vein, which were supplying

     HISTORY:  Portal hypertension, failed liver transplant, recurrent variceal
     hemorrhage, prior TIPS at outside institution.
     
     PHYSICIANS:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 60**] [**Last Name (LF) 41**], [**First Name3 (LF) 3501**] [**Doctor Last Name 2234**], and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 511**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 512**] with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 512**], the attending radiologist, being present and supervising throughout
     the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Following written informed consent, the patient was positioned
     supine on the angiography table.  A preprocedure timeout was performed to
     confirm patient, procedure, and site.  Induction of general anesthesia by the
     anesthesiology service.  Standard sterile prep and drape of the right base of
     the neck and the abdomen.  Local anesthesia with 10 cc of 1% lidocaine
     subcutaneously.  Using realtime ultrasound guidance, a 22-gauge needle was
     advanced into the right internal jugular vein.  A 0.018-inch guidewire was
     advanced through the needle into the superior vena cava using fluoroscopic
     guidance.  Needle was exchanged for the introducer sheath and then the
     guidewire was exchanged for a 0.035-inch guidewire.  The micropuncture sheath
     was exchanged for a 7-French bright-tip vascular sheath, which was positioned
     in the inferior vena cava.  Attempts were then made to cannulate the right
     hepatic vein using a SOS Omni catheter and guidewire.  These were
     unsuccessful.  Therefore, a 21-gauge needle was used to access the TIPS using
     a percutaneous transhepatic approach through the right lobe of the liver.  A
     0.018-inch guidewire was advanced through the needle into the right hepatic
     vein.  The needle was exchanged for the Accustick sheath and then the
     guidewire was exchanged for a 0.035-inch guidewire, which was positioned in
     the superior vena cava using fluoroscopic guidance.  A 25 mm gooseneck snare
     was used to snare the wire from the jugular access and then the right internal
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Portal hypertension, failed liver transplant, recurrent variceal
     hemorrhage, prior TIPS at outside institution.
     
     PHYSICIANS:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 60**] [**Last Name (LF) 41**], [**First Name3 (LF) 3501**] [**Doctor Last Name 2234**], and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 511**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 512**] with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 512**], the attending radiologist, being present and supervising throughout
     the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Following written informed consent, the patient was positioned
     supine on the angiography table.  A preprocedure timeout was performed to
     confirm patient, procedure, and site.  Induction of general anesthesia by the
     anesthesiology service.  Standard sterile prep and drape of the right base of
     the neck and the abdomen.  Local anesthesia with 10 cc of 1% lidocaine
     subcutaneously.  Using realtime ultrasound guidance, a 22-gauge needle was
     advanced into the right internal jugular vein.  A 0.018-inch guidewire was
     advanced through the needle into the superior vena cava using fluoroscopic
     guidance.  Needle was exchanged for the introducer sheath and then the
     guidewire was exchanged for a 0.035-inch guidewire.  The micropuncture sheath
     was exchanged for a 7-French bright-tip vascular sheath, which was positioned
     in the inferior vena cava.  Attempts were then made to cannulate the right
     hepatic vein using a SOS Omni catheter and guidewire.  These were
     unsuccessful.  Therefore, a 21-gauge needle was used to access the TIPS using
     a percutaneous transhepatic approach through the right lobe of the liver.  A
     0.018-inch guidewire was advanced through the needle into the right hepatic
     vein.  The needle was exchanged for the Accustick sheath and then the
     guidewire was exchanged for a 0.035-inch guidewire, which was positioned in
     the superior vena cava using fluoroscopic guidance.  A 25 mm gooseneck snare
     was used to snare the wire from the jugular access and then the right internal

     jugular vein sheath was advanced over the snare guidewire into the superior
     aspect of the TIPS.  The guidewire was then pulled through the sheath and
     through-and-through access was obtained.  The Berenstein catheter was advanced
     over the guidewire through the sheath and then the guidewire was removed.
     Then, using a new guidewire, the distal aspect of the TIPS was accessed from
     the jugular access.  The catheter and wire were advanced into the splenic
     vein.  Venography was performed from this catheter position.  This
     demonstrated patency of the downstream portion of the splenic vein, main
     portal vein, TIPS, right hepatic vein and inferior vena cava.  Mild narrowing
     was seen at the superior aspect of the TIPS and within the right hepatic vein.
     Hepatopedal flow is visualized in the left portal vein, which is patent.  The
     coronary vein is patent and there is reperfusion of venous collaterals through
     the in situ coils with opacification of moderate-to-large gastroesophageal
     varices.  Pressures were then obtained.  The main portal vein pressure was 32
     mmHg, the inferior aspect of the TIPS was 31 mmHg, mid TIPS was 31 mmHg,
     superior aspect of the TIPS was 30 mmHg, the right hepatic vein was 29 mmHg,
     in the right atrium was 27/22, mean 24 mmHg.  Using a Cobra catheter, the
     coronary vein was selected and then a tributary of the coronary vein was
     selected.  This was embolized with 3 mm x 3 cm stainless steel coils and with
     a total of 6 mL of absolute alcohol.  The second tributary of the coronary
     vein was then selected and was embolized with two 4 mm x 3 cm coils and with 2
     cc of absolute ethanol.  Venography of the coronary vein was then performed
     demonstrating patency of the downstream portion of the coronary vein, but
     occlusion of the 2 tributaries and no further opacification of the
     gastroesophageal varices arising from the coronary vein.  The superior aspect
     of the TIPS and the outflow hepatic vein was then angioplastied with a 12 mm x
     4 cm angioplasty balloon.  Pressure measurements were then obtained from the
     portal vein and the right atrium.  The portal vein pressure was 32 mmHg and
     the right atrial pressure was 26 mmHg.  This equates to a portosystemic
     gradient of 6 mmHg post-TIPS revision.  The gradient was 8 mmHg pre-revision.
     
     All wires, sheaths and catheters were removed and hemostasis was ensured with
     direct manual compression.  General anesthesia was reversed by the
     anesthesiology service and the patient was transferred to the PACU in stable
     condition.  There were no immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Revision of the in situ TIPS was performed by combination of
     right internal jugular and percutaneous transhepatic access.  The TIPS was
     angioplastied with a 12-mm balloon with a decrease in the gradient from 8 mmHg
     pre-treatment to 6 mmHg post-treatment.  In addition, embolization was
     performed of 2 separate tributaries of the coronary vein, which were supplying
     gastroesophageal varices.
     
     
                                                                 (Over)

     jugular vein sheath was advanced over the snare guidewire into the superior
     aspect of the TIPS.  The guidewire was then pulled through the sheath and
     through-and-through access was obtained.  The Berenstein catheter was advanced
     over the guidewire through the sheath and then the guidewire was removed.
     Then, using a new guidewire, the distal aspect of the TIPS was accessed from
     the jugular access.  The catheter and wire were advanced into the splenic
     vein.  Venography was performed from this catheter position.  This
     demonstrated patency of the downstream portion of the splenic vein, main
     portal vein, TIPS, right hepatic vein and inferior vena cava.  Mild narrowing
     was seen at the superior aspect of the TIPS and within the right hepatic vein.
     Hepatopedal flow is visualized in the left portal vein, which is patent.  The
     coronary vein is patent and there is reperfusion of venous collaterals through
     the in situ coils with opacification of moderate-to-large gastroesophageal
     varices.  Pressures were then obtained.  The main portal vein pressure was 32
     mmHg, the inferior aspect of the TIPS was 31 mmHg, mid TIPS was 31 mmHg,
     superior aspect of the TIPS was 30 mmHg, the right hepatic vein was 29 mmHg,
     in the right atrium was 27/22, mean 24 mmHg.  Using a Cobra catheter, the
     coronary vein was selected and then a tributary of the coronary vein was
     selected.  This was embolized with 3 mm x 3 cm stainless steel coils and with
     a total of 6 mL of absolute alcohol.  The second tributary of the coronary
     vein was then selected and was embolized with two 4 mm x 3 cm coils and with 2
     cc of absolute ethanol.  Venography of the coronary vein was then performed
     demonstrating patency of the downstream portion of the coronary vein, but
     occlusion of the 2 tributaries and no further opacification of the
     gastroesophageal varices arising from the coronary vein.  The superior aspect
     of the TIPS and the outflow hepatic vein was then angioplastied with a 12 mm x
     4 cm angioplasty balloon.  Pressure measurements were then obtained from the
     portal vein and the right atrium.  The portal vein pressure was 32 mmHg and
     the right atrial pressure was 26 mmHg.  This equates to a portosystemic
     gradient of 6 mmHg post-TIPS revision.  The gradient was 8 mmHg pre-revision.
     
     All wires, sheaths and catheters were removed and hemostasis was ensured with
     direct manual compression.  General anesthesia was reversed by the
     anesthesiology service and the patient was transferred to the PACU in stable
     condition.  There were no immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Revision of the in situ TIPS was performed by combination of
     right internal jugular and percutaneous transhepatic access.  The TIPS was
     angioplastied with a 12-mm balloon with a decrease in the gradient from 8 mmHg
     pre-treatment to 6 mmHg post-treatment.  In addition, embolization was
     performed of 2 separate tributaries of the coronary vein, which were supplying
     gastroesophageal varices.

     HISTORY:  Portal hypertension, failed liver transplant, recurrent variceal
     hemorrhage, prior TIPS at outside institution.
     
     PHYSICIANS:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 60**] [**Last Name (LF) 41**], [**First Name3 (LF) 3501**] [**Doctor Last Name 2234**], and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 511**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 512**] with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 512**], the attending radiologist, being present and supervising throughout
     the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Following written informed consent, the patient was positioned
     supine on the angiography table.  A preprocedure timeout was performed to
     confirm patient, procedure, and site.  Induction of general anesthesia by the
     anesthesiology service.  Standard sterile prep and drape of the right base of
     the neck and the abdomen.  Local anesthesia with 10 cc of 1% lidocaine
     subcutaneously.  Using realtime ultrasound guidance, a 22-gauge needle was
     advanced into the right internal jugular vein.  A 0.018-inch guidewire was
     advanced through the needle into the superior vena cava using fluoroscopic
     guidance.  Needle was exchanged for the introducer sheath and then the
     guidewire was exchanged for a 0.035-inch guidewire.  The micropuncture sheath
     was exchanged for a 7-French bright-tip vascular sheath, which was positioned
     in the inferior vena cava.  Attempts were then made to cannulate the right
     hepatic vein using a SOS Omni catheter and guidewire.  These were
     unsuccessful.  Therefore, a 21-gauge needle was used to access the TIPS using
     a percutaneous transhepatic approach through the right lobe of the liver.  A
     0.018-inch guidewire was advanced through the needle into the right hepatic
     vein.  The needle was exchanged for the Accustick sheath and then the
     guidewire was exchanged for a 0.035-inch guidewire, which was positioned in
     the superior vena cava using fluoroscopic guidance.  A 25 mm gooseneck snare
     was used to snare the wire from the jugular access and then the right internal
                                                                 (Over)

     HISTORY:  Portal hypertension, failed liver transplant, recurrent variceal
     hemorrhage, prior TIPS at outside institution.
     
     PHYSICIANS:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 60**] [**Last Name (LF) 41**], [**First Name3 (LF) 3501**] [**Doctor Last Name 2234**], and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 511**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 512**] with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 512**], the attending radiologist, being present and supervising throughout
     the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Following written informed consent, the patient was positioned
     supine on the angiography table.  A preprocedure timeout was performed to
     confirm patient, procedure, and site.  Induction of general anesthesia by the
     anesthesiology service.  Standard sterile prep and drape of the right base of
     the neck and the abdomen.  Local anesthesia with 10 cc of 1% lidocaine
     subcutaneously.  Using realtime ultrasound guidance, a 22-gauge needle was
     advanced into the right internal jugular vein.  A 0.018-inch guidewire was
     advanced through the needle into the superior vena cava using fluoroscopic
     guidance.  Needle was exchanged for the introducer sheath and then the
     guidewire was exchanged for a 0.035-inch guidewire.  The micropuncture sheath
     was exchanged for a 7-French bright-tip vascular sheath, which was positioned
     in the inferior vena cava.  Attempts were then made to cannulate the right
     hepatic vein using a SOS Omni catheter and guidewire.  These were
     unsuccessful.  Therefore, a 21-gauge needle was used to access the TIPS using
     a percutaneous transhepatic approach through the right lobe of the liver.  A
     0.018-inch guidewire was advanced through the needle into the right hepatic
     vein.  The needle was exchanged for the Accustick sheath and then the
     guidewire was exchanged for a 0.035-inch guidewire, which was positioned in

     jugular vein sheath was advanced over the snare guidewire into the superior
     aspect of the TIPS.  The guidewire was then pulled through the sheath and
     through-and-through access was obtained.  The Berenstein catheter was advanced
     over the guidewire through the sheath and then the guidewire was removed.
     Then, using a new guidewire, the distal aspect of the TIPS was accessed from
     the jugular access.  The catheter and wire were advanced into the splenic
     vein.  Venography was performed from this catheter position.  This
     demonstrated patency of the downstream portion of the splenic vein, main
     portal vein, TIPS, right hepatic vein and inferior vena cava.  Mild narrowing
     was seen at the superior aspect of the TIPS and within the right hepatic vein.
     Hepatopedal flow is visualized in the left portal vein, which is patent.  The
     coronary vein is patent and there is reperfusion of venous collaterals through
     the in situ coils with opacification of moderate-to-large gastroesophageal
     varices.  Pressures were then obtained.  The main portal vein pressure was 32
     mmHg, the inferior aspect of the TIPS was 31 mmHg, mid TIPS was 31 mmHg,
     superior aspect of the TIPS was 30 mmHg, the right hepatic vein was 29 mmHg,
     in the right atrium was 27/22, mean 24 mmHg.  Using a Cobra catheter, the
     coronary vein was selected and then a tributary of the coronary vein was
     selected.  This was embolized with 3 mm x 3 cm stainless steel coils and with
     a total of 6 mL of absolute alcohol.  The second tributary of the coronary
     vein was then selected and was embolized with two 4 mm x 3 cm coils and with 2
     cc of absolute ethanol.  Venography of the coronary vein was then performed
     demonstrating patency of the downstream portion of the coronary vein, but
     occlusion of the 2 tributaries and no further opacification of the
     gastroesophageal varices arising from the coronary vein.  The superior aspect
     of the TIPS and the outflow hepatic vein was then angioplastied with a 12 mm x
     4 cm angioplasty balloon.  Pressure measurements were then obtained from the
     portal vein and the right atrium.  The portal vein pressure was 32 mmHg and
     the right atrial pressure was 26 mmHg.  This equates to a portosystemic
     gradient of 6 mmHg post-TIPS revision.  The gradient was 8 mmHg pre-revision.
     
     All wires, sheaths and catheters were removed and hemostasis was ensured with
     direct manual compression.  General anesthesia was reversed by the
     anesthesiology service and the patient was transferred to the PACU in stable
     condition.  There were no immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Revision of the in situ TIPS was performed by combination of
     right internal jugular and percutaneous transhepatic access.  The TIPS was
     angioplastied with a 12-mm balloon with a decrease in the gradient from 8 mmHg
     pre-treatment to 6 mmHg post-treatment.  In addition, embolization was
     performed of 2 separate tributaries of the coronary vein, which were supplying
     gastroesophageal varices.
     
     
                                                                 (Over)

     over the guidewire through the sheath and then the guidewire was removed.
     Then, using a new guidewire, the distal aspect of the TIPS was accessed from
     the jugular access.  The catheter and wire were advanced into the splenic
     vein.  Venography was performed from this catheter position.  This
     demonstrated patency of the downstream portion of the splenic vein, main
     portal vein, TIPS, right hepatic vein and inferior vena cava.  Mild narrowing
     was seen at the superior aspect of the TIPS and within the right hepatic vein.
     Hepatopedal flow is visualized in the left portal vein, which is patent.  The
     coronary vein is patent and there is reperfusion of venous collaterals through
     the in situ coils with opacification of moderate-to-large gastroesophageal
     varices.  Pressures were then obtained.  The main portal vein pressure was 32
     mmHg, the inferior aspect of the TIPS was 31 mmHg, mid TIPS was 31 mmHg,
     superior aspect of the TIPS was 30 mmHg, the right hepatic vein was 29 mmHg,
     in the right atrium was 27/22, mean 24 mmHg.  Using a Cobra catheter, the
     coronary vein was selected and then a tributary of the coronary vein was
     selected.  This was embolized with 3 mm x 3 cm stainless steel coils and with
     a total of 6 mL of absolute alcohol.  The second tributary of the coronary
     vein was then selected and was embolized with two 4 mm x 3 cm coils and with 2
     cc of absolute ethanol.  Venography of the coronary vein was then performed
     demonstrating patency of the downstream portion of the coronary vein, but
     occlusion of the 2 tributaries and no further opacification of the
     gastroesophageal varices arising from the coronary vein.  The superior aspect
     of the TIPS and the outflow hepatic vein was then angioplastied with a 12 mm x
     4 cm angioplasty balloon.  Pressure measurements were then obtained from the
     portal vein and the right atrium.  The portal vein pressure was 32 mmHg and
     the right atrial pressure was 26 mmHg.  This equates to a portosystemic
     gradient of 6 mmHg post-TIPS revision.  The gradient was 8 mmHg pre-revision.
     
     All wires, sheaths and catheters were removed and hemostasis was ensured with
     direct manual compression.  General anesthesia was reversed by the
     anesthesiology service and the patient was transferred to the PACU in stable
     condition.  There were no immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Revision of the in situ TIPS was performed by combination of
     right internal jugular and percutaneous transhepatic access.  The TIPS was
     angioplastied with a 12-mm balloon with a decrease in the gradient from 8 mmHg
     pre-treatment to 6 mmHg post-treatment.  In addition, embolization was
     performed of 2 separate tributaries of the coronary vein, which were supplying
     gastroesophageal varices.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
       46 year old man with failed liver transplant, s/p TIPS, recurrent variceal   
      bleed
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      TIPS revision

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Portal hypertension, failed liver transplant, recurrent variceal
     hemorrhage, prior TIPS at outside institution.
     
     PHYSICIANS:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 60**] [**Last Name (LF) 41**], [**First Name3 (LF) 3501**] [**Doctor Last Name 2234**], and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 511**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 512**] with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 512**], the attending radiologist, being present and supervising throughout
     the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Following written informed consent, the patient was positioned
     supine on the angiography table.  A preprocedure timeout was performed to
     confirm patient, procedure, and site.  Induction of general anesthesia by the
     anesthesiology service.  Standard sterile prep and drape of the right base of
     the neck and the abdomen.  Local anesthesia with 10 cc of 1% lidocaine
     subcutaneously.  Using realtime ultrasound guidance, a 22-gauge needle was
     advanced into the right internal jugular vein.  A 0.018-inch guidewire was
     advanced through the needle into the superior vena cava using fluoroscopic
     guidance.  Needle was exchanged for the introducer sheath and then the
     guidewire was exchanged for a 0.035-inch guidewire.  The micropuncture sheath
     was exchanged for a 7-French bright-tip vascular sheath, which was positioned
     in the inferior vena cava.  Attempts were then made to cannulate the right
     hepatic vein using a SOS Omni catheter and guidewire.  These were
     unsuccessful.  Therefore, a 21-gauge needle was used to access the TIPS using
     a percutaneous transhepatic approach through the right lobe of the liver.  A
     0.018-inch guidewire was advanced through the needle into the right hepatic
     vein.  The needle was exchanged for the Accustick sheath and then the
     guidewire was exchanged for a 0.035-inch guidewire, which was positioned in
     the superior vena cava using fluoroscopic guidance.  A 25 mm gooseneck snare
     was used to snare the wire from the jugular access and then the right internal
                                                                 (Over)

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
       46 year old man with failed liver transplant, s/p TIPS, recurrent variceal   
      bleed
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      TIPS revision                                                                   
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Portal hypertension, failed liver transplant, recurrent variceal
     hemorrhage, prior TIPS at outside institution.
     
     PHYSICIANS:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 60**] [**Last Name (LF) 41**], [**First Name3 (LF) 3501**] [**Doctor Last Name 2234**], and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 511**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 512**] with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 512**], the attending radiologist, being present and supervising throughout
     the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Following written informed consent, the patient was positioned
     supine on the angiography table.  A preprocedure timeout was performed to
     confirm patient, procedure, and site.  Induction of general anesthesia by the
     anesthesiology service.  Standard sterile prep and drape of the right base of
     the neck and the abdomen.  Local anesthesia with 10 cc of 1% lidocaine
     subcutaneously.  Using realtime ultrasound guidance, a 22-gauge needle was
     advanced into the right internal jugular vein.  A 0.018-inch guidewire was
     advanced through the needle into the superior vena cava using fluoroscopic
     guidance.  Needle was exchanged for the introducer sheath and then the
     guidewire was exchanged for a 0.035-inch guidewire.  The micropuncture sheath
     was exchanged for a 7-French bright-tip vascular sheath, which was positioned
     in the inferior vena cava.  Attempts were then made to cannulate the right
     hepatic vein using a SOS Omni catheter and guidewire.  These were
     unsuccessful.  Therefore, a 21-gauge needle was used to access the TIPS using
     a percutaneous transhepatic approach through the right lobe of the liver.  A
     0.018-inch guidewire was advanced through the needle into the right hepatic
     vein.  The needle was exchanged for the Accustick sheath and then the
     guidewire was exchanged for a 0.035-inch guidewire, which was positioned in
     the superior vena cava using fluoroscopic guidance.  A 25 mm gooseneck snare
     was used to snare the wire from the jugular access and then the right internal
                                                                 (Over)

     jugular vein sheath was advanced over the snare guidewire into the superior
     aspect of the TIPS.  The guidewire was then pulled through the sheath and
     through-and-through access was obtained.  The Berenstein catheter was advanced
     over the guidewire through the sheath and then the guidewire was removed.
     Then, using a new guidewire, the distal aspect of the TIPS was accessed from
     the jugular access.  The catheter and wire were advanced into the splenic
     vein.  Venography was performed from this catheter position.  This
     demonstrated patency of the downstream portion of the splenic vein, main
     portal vein, TIPS, right hepatic vein and inferior vena cava.  Mild narrowing
     was seen at the superior aspect of the TIPS and within the right hepatic vein.
     Hepatopedal flow is visualized in the left portal vein, which is patent.  The
     coronary vein is patent and there is reperfusion of venous collaterals through
     the in situ coils with opacification of moderate-to-large gastroesophageal
     varices.  Pressures were then obtained.  The main portal vein pressure was 32
     mmHg, the inferior aspect of the TIPS was 31 mmHg, mid TIPS was 31 mmHg,
     superior aspect of the TIPS was 30 mmHg, the right hepatic vein was 29 mmHg,
     in the right atrium was 27/22, mean 24 mmHg.  Using a Cobra catheter, the
     coronary vein was selected and then a tributary of the coronary vein was
     selected.  This was embolized with 3 mm x 3 cm stainless steel coils and with
     a total of 6 mL of absolute alcohol.  The second tributary of the coronary
     vein was then selected and was embolized with two 4 mm x 3 cm coils and with 2
     cc of absolute ethanol.  Venography of the coronary vein was then performed
     demonstrating patency of the downstream portion of the coronary vein, but
     occlusion of the 2 tributaries and no further opacification of the
     gastroesophageal varices arising from the coronary vein.  The superior aspect
     of the TIPS and the outflow hepatic vein was then angioplastied with a 12 mm x
     4 cm angioplasty balloon.  Pressure measurements were then obtained from the
     portal vein and the right atrium.  The portal vein pressure was 32 mmHg and
     the right atrial pressure was 26 mmHg.  This equates to a portosystemic
     gradient of 6 mmHg post-TIPS revision.  The gradient was 8 mmHg pre-revision.
     
     All wires, sheaths and catheters were removed and hemostasis was ensured with
     direct manual compression.  General anesthesia was reversed by the
     anesthesiology service and the patient was transferred to the PACU in stable
     condition.  There were no immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Revision of the in situ TIPS was performed by combination of
     right internal jugular and percutaneous transhepatic access.  The TIPS was
     angioplastied with a 12-mm balloon with a decrease in the gradient from 8 mmHg
     pre-treatment to 6 mmHg post-treatment.  In addition, embolization was
     performed of 2 separate tributaries of the coronary vein, which were supplying
     gastroesophageal varices.
