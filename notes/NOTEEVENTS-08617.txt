Admission Date:  [**3344-12-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**3344-12-28**]

Date of Birth:   [**3281-2-26**]     Sex:  M

Service:  Medicine

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  He was admitted with a chief complaint of
new orthopnea, increased lower extremity edema, and rapid
heart rate.  He deceased on [**3344-12-28**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 11982**] is a 63-year-old
male with an extensive past medical history who presents with
a 1-week history of orthopnea, increased lower extremity
edema, and rapid heart rate.

He was in his usual state of health until eight days prior to
admission when he noticed his prostheses no longer fit.  His
has bilateral below-knee amputation with leg prostheses.
Usually they are a little bit loose and he wears a few socks
to fit them appropriately.  He noted he no longer needed the
socks, and in fact he could barely squeeze his legs into
them.  He also noted he could not lay flat.  Also, when he
took his blood pressure on the blood pressure machine his
heart rate was greater than 120.  He called his cardiologist,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1357**], with these complaints four days prior to
admission and was told to increase his Lasix dose, which he
did.  He called Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 10550**] office again one day prior to
admission and was told to increase it again, which he did,
still without much benefit.  The lower extremity edema and
orthopnea remained unchanged, and his heart rate also
remained unchanged.

On the day of admission he finally could no longer wear his
prostheses as they no longer fit, and he came to the
hospital.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed at age eight.
2.  Bilateral below-knee amputation in the early 1990s.
3.  Mild proteinuria.
4.  Coronary artery disease, status post 6-vessel coronary
artery bypass graft in [**3332**].
5.  Hypertension.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications on admission included
Lopressor, Zocor, Univasc, Lasix, aspirin, NPH, and regular
insulin as his main medications.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   In the Emergency Department the patient
was found to be in atrial flutter at a rate of 150.  He was
rate controlled with Lopressor intravenously and then p.o.,
and his heart rate decreased to 70s to 80s.  His first
creatine kinase and troponin were negative, and he was
admitted.

He was placed on telemetry.  Enzymes were cycled.  He had a
mild positive troponin of 0.9.  He had mild positive creatine
kinase at 220 with a MB of 11, giving an index of 7.  He
remained in atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter and on
telemetry.  Lopressor 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. was used for rate
control with good, by not excellent, affect as his heart rate
would creep over 100 in the hour before receiving his next
dose of Lopressor.  His Lasix was changed from p.o. to
intravenous and kept at the same level during the first 24
hours.  He did not really diuresis anything.  His Lasix, at
that time, was increased and he diuresed slightly a few
hundred cc negative on hospital day two.  On hospital day
three his intravenous Lasix was increased even more.

Upon admission, the patient was placed on a heparin drip for
anticoagulation.  He remained on this throughout his hospital
course.

On hospital day three, the decision was made to pursue a
transesophageal echocardiogram with cardioversion as
restoring normal sinus rhythm to his heart would likely help
his congestive heart failure.  The patient agreed to this
procedure.  Also of note on admission, the patient was noted
to have a right pleural effusion larger than in the past.  In
the past he has had a right pleural effusion associated with
congestive heart failure flares.  This was not tapped because
the etiology of this effusion was congestive heart failure,
and diuresis was the treatment.

On [**3344-12-28**], the patient went for a transesophageal
echocardiogram and cardioversion.  The transesophageal
echocardiogram portion was successful and revealed no clot in
the left atrium.  However, they did not examine the left
ventricle or any other [**Doctor Last Name **] of the heart because the
patient began to not tolerate the procedure.  However, it was
deemed safe to cardiovert the patient at that time, which was
done.  The patient tolerated the cardioversion well.  The
patient began waking up approximately 10 minutes after the
cardioversion.  When he was waking up from the anesthesia he
experienced bradycardia.  His heart rate dropped into the
30s.  He became apneic, and he became pulseless.  At that
time he was intubated by anesthesia, and the Cardiology team
began resuscitative efforts including atropine and a pacing
wire.

Over the course of the next 45 minutes multiple attempts were
made at resuscitation using pacing wires.  The patient was
taken to the catheterization laboratory where his cardiac
vessels were examined under fluoroscopy for acute thrombus.
The patient underwent multiple shocks for pulseless
ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation.  These
transiently restored normal sinus and restored a pulse.
However, over the course of the 45 minutes the patient
continued to become bradycardic and then asystolic.  Pacing
was done and an intra-aortic balloon pump was put in place
which transiently restored a pulse.  Eventually, the
patient's underlying rhythm became ventricular
tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation, pulseless and it was
refractory to shocks.

After approximately 10 more minutes of attempts to restore
normal sinus rhythm without any success and without any
success at obtaining a pulse, the patient was pronounced dead
at 2:20 p.m. on [**3344-12-28**].  The attendings were
notified.  The Cardiology attending was notified.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 11983**],
his [**Last Name (un) **] doctor, was also notified.  The medical examiner
was notified who declined the case.  The patient's next of
[**Doctor First Name **] is his brother out in [**State 4011**].  Messages were left for
the brother with the Cardiology fellow's pager number.  At
the time of this dictation the family had not called back.
The family will be notified, and at that point a postmortem
will be determined.
