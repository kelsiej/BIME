DISCHARGE SUMMARY ADDENDUM:  This dictation records the
events from [**12-4**] to [**12-6**].

The patient proceeded to endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography on [**3302-12-4**].  This procedure was
done in the Operating Room under general anesthesia.  Several
round stones ranging from 4 mm to 10 mm causing partial
obstruction was seen in the common bile duct.  There was post
obstructive dilation.  Gallstones were also visualized in the
gallbladder.  There was noted to be a distal pancreatic duct.
A biliary sphincterotomy was performed at the 12:00 position
and the stones were extracted successfully using a 12 mm
balloon.  After the procedure the patient did well
postoperatively.  He did not have any further episodes of
chest pain or shortness of breath.  He continued to diuresed
with Lasix 40 mg po b.i.d.  His diet was advanced on [**12-6**]
without any further incidence of abdominal pain.

In[**Last Name (STitle) 11381**] of his aortic valve repair, he will be seen by Dr.
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in two to three weeks as an outpatient.

     HISTORY:  Gallstone pancreatitis.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MR cholangiopancreatography was performed.  Due to the patient's
     inability to respond to breathholding instuctions, non-breathholding imaging
     strategies were pursued.  The following sequences were obtained:  Axial T1-
     weighted in and out of phase images, axial T2-weighted inversion recovery
     images, coronal and axial HASTE images, axial 2D TOF images, heavily weighted
     thick slab T2-weighted images, and axial T1-weighted FLASH images prior to and
     following the intravenous administration of Gadolinium.
     
     Comparison is made to the abdominal ultrasound examination dated [**3302-11-23**] and
     the ERCP dated [**3302-11-24**].
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     MR ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The liver is normal in size and contour.  Loss of
     signal from the hepatic parenchyma on out of phase images is consistent with
     fatty infiltration.  No enhancing hepatic mass is identified.  There is no
     intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
     
     The gallbladder wall is thickened and pericholecystic fluid is present, the
     appearance suggesting gallbladder wall edema. Several gallstones are seen
     within the body and neck of the gallbladder. Multiple filling defects within
     the common bile duct represent choledocholithiasis.  The gallbladder mucosa
     enhances uniformally.
     
     The pancreas enhances homogeneously.  There is a moderate amount of
     peripancreatic fluid tracking along the left perirenal space.  No pancreatic
     mass lesion is identified.  The splenic vein is patent.  The splenic artery is
     normal in caliber.
     
     The spleen and adrenal glands are unremarkable.
     
     There are symmetric nephrograms.  The renal cortex is thinned and irregular,
     bilaterally, representing scarring.  Multiple thin walled nonseptated renal
     cysts are identified in both kidneys, the largest arising from the lower pole
     of the right kidney measures 7 cm.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Gallstone pancreatitis.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MR cholangiopancreatography was performed.  Due to the patient's
     inability to respond to breathholding instuctions, non-breathholding imaging
     strategies were pursued.  The following sequences were obtained:  Axial T1-
     weighted in and out of phase images, axial T2-weighted inversion recovery
     images, coronal and axial HASTE images, axial 2D TOF images, heavily weighted
     thick slab T2-weighted images, and axial T1-weighted FLASH images prior to and
     following the intravenous administration of Gadolinium.
     
     Comparison is made to the abdominal ultrasound examination dated [**3302-11-23**] and
     the ERCP dated [**3302-11-24**].
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     MR ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The liver is normal in size and contour.  Loss of
     signal from the hepatic parenchyma on out of phase images is consistent with
     fatty infiltration.  No enhancing hepatic mass is identified.  There is no
     intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
     
     The gallbladder wall is thickened and pericholecystic fluid is present, the
     appearance suggesting gallbladder wall edema. Several gallstones are seen
     within the body and neck of the gallbladder. Multiple filling defects within
     the common bile duct represent choledocholithiasis.  The gallbladder mucosa
     enhances uniformally.
     
     The pancreas enhances homogeneously.  There is a moderate amount of
     peripancreatic fluid tracking along the left perirenal space.  No pancreatic
     mass lesion is identified.  The splenic vein is patent.  The splenic artery is
     normal in caliber.
     
     The spleen and adrenal glands are unremarkable.
     
     There are symmetric nephrograms.  The renal cortex is thinned and irregular,

     stones.
     
     FINDINGS:  Six fluoroscopic spot images from an ERCP procedure performed by
     the gastroenterology department are provided for review.  The pancreatic
     duct in the region of the uncinate process and head of the pancreas is
     visualized and is normal in appearance.  The remainder of the pancreatic duct
     is not visualized.  There are numerous filling defects consistent with stones
     present in the common bile duct.  The common bile duct is mildly dilated
     throughout.  There are gallstones visualized in the gallbladder.  Per report,
     the common bile duct stones were removed, however, no post-procedure images
     are available for review.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      86 year old man with critical AS s/p unwitnessed fall on coumadin.              
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Critical aortic stenosis unwitnessed fall on Coumadin rule out
     hemorrhage.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Axial non-contrast CT scans of the brain were obtained.
     
     Comparison is made to the previous CT [**3300-7-20**].
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     There is no hyperdensity within the brain or in the extra-axial spaces to
     indicate acute intracranial hemorrhage.  There is artifact limiting evaluation
     of the posterior fossa structures.  There appears to be a lacunar infarction
     in the right cerebellar hemisphere.  This was not well seen on the previous
     study, but looks chronic.  No gyral edema or loss of [**Doctor Last Name 30**] white matter
     differentiation is clearly identified to suggest acute cortical infarction.
     
     The ventricles are not dilated.  There is no shift of mid-line structures.
     There is volume loss with widening of the extra-axial spaces.
     
     There are dense carotid siphen calcifications.
     
     Radiopaque material is seen adjacent to the left globe which is probably post-
     surgical.
     
     No lytic or destructive changes of the skull are identified.  There is minimal
     right maxillary sinus mucosal thickening.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or edema.

     COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to prior ultrasound study of same day.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained
     following the administration of oral contrast.  IV contrast was not used due
     to the patient's elevated creatine.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST: There is a moderate-size, left pleural effusion
     with a small right pleural effusion.  There is minimal atelectasis at both
     lung bases with bilateral, small patchy densities, none specific in nature.
     There is no pericardial effusion.  Within limits of this unenhanced scan,
     there are no focal abnormalities.  There is a small amount of gas within the
     gallbladder and within the common duct, consistent with the patient's known
     history of sphincterotomy.  There is a small amount of free fluid adjacent to
     the liver as well as within the left paracolic gutter.  The spleen, pancreas,
     and adrenal glands are within normal limits.  There is slight cortical loss
     within the kidneys bilaterally.  At the lower pole of the right kidney, there
     is a 7.5-cm simple cyst.  There is no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  The
     opacified loops of bowel are normal in caliber.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS W/CONTRAST: There is a small amount of stranding within the
     left pelvis, without clear source.  There  are scattered sigmoid diverticula,
     but no evidence of acute diverticulitis.  The bladder and prostate gland are
     unremarkable in appearance.  There is no inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS: Patient is s/p sternotomy.  There are no suspicious lytic or
     sclerotic bony lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Small amount of free fluid within the abdomen, which is a nonspecific

     FINDINGS:  Compared to a film on [**3303-3-3**], the cardiomegaly is unchanged.
     Calcification projecting over the heart on lateral view suggests calcified
     mitral valve.  CABG changes are evident as well.
     
     The pulmonary vascular markings remain within normal limits.  There are no
