HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known patient firstname 2145**] [**Known patient lastname 11015**] is a 40-year old
female with a past medical history of AFib, rheumatoid
arthritis, anemia, CHF, and coronary artery disease who
presents from an outside hospital with an intraventricular
bleed. The patient's husband found his wife, who had been
left at home alone briefly, on the toilet slumped over the
right leaning her head against the wall. The patient was able
to answer questions, but was slightly confused and unable to
ambulate. The patient was brought to [**Hospital **] Hospital and
found to have a intraventricular bleed with an INR of 3.4.
the patient was given FFP and then to deteriorate while at
the hospital, becoming increasingly somnolent. The patient
was intubated and then transferred to [**Hospital1 797**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for rheumatoid arthritis,
anemia, CHF, CAD, and GERD.

MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION:  Coumadin, iron,
Protonix, Lasix, digoxin, potassium, diltiazem, prednisone,
and metoprolol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She was intubated, not awake. Vital
signs were stable. Last sedative medications given 45 minutes
prior to the exam. The pupils were 2 mm to 3 mm bilaterally
and fixed. She did have positive corneal reflexes. She was
moving all four extremities to painful stimuli. Did not
follow commands. The toes were downgoing bilaterally.

RADIOLOGIC STUDIES:  A CAT scan did show an intraventricular
hemorrhage.

LABORATORY DATA:  INR was 1.4, PT of 14.9, PTT of 28.2. White
blood cells of 11.1, hematocrit of 36.5, and platelets of
368.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and a long
discussion was had with the family in regard to options, and
the family discussed with each other, and given the patient's
DNR status they wished for her to be treated medically but
not surgically. Her INR was reversed to be less than 1.3. She
was started on neuro checks every hour and was transferred
from the emergency room to the ICU. She had a repeat CAT scan
on [**1-15**] which was unchanged and continued to show the
extensive intraventricular hemorrhage. On exam, she remained
intubated. She was able to move all four extremities to pain
and did localize; however, she had a slight right paresis. On
[**1-16**] - per the family's request - the patient was made
comfort measures only. She then expired on [**2789-1-16**]
at approximately 19:00.

     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  Allowing for differences in technique, there has been no change in
     the appearance of a large volume of hemorrhage within the septum

     hemorrhage. There is a tiny amount of hemorrhage within the interpeduncular
     cistern. Again noted, is a moderate amount of edema surrounding the
     septal and intraventricular hematoma.  The size of the ventricles is
     unchanged. There is no shift of the normally midline structures.  There is no
     sign of fracture or bone destruction.  The nasal sinuses and orbits are
     unremarkable.

     1.  Stable appearance of septal hematoma and intraventricular hemorrhage.

      extensive intraventricular hemorrhage with 3.0 cm oval area of hemorrhage with
      hematocrit effect in the region of the septum pellucidum.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Outside hospital CT with bleed, patient found unresponsive, on
     Coumadin.
     
     There are no prior studies available for comparison.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is extensive centered in the corpus callosum
     with rupture into both lateral ventricles. There is blood filling the entire
     left lateral ventricle. There is partial filling of the right lateral
     ventricle with sparing of the frontal and temporal horns. An oval roughly 3.5
     x 2.3 cm area of acute hemorrhage with a hematocrit effect is seen in the
     region of the septum pellicudum, inferior to the cingulate gyrus and
     projecting into the right lateral ventricle. There are diffuse periventricular
     and subcortical white matter hyperdensities consistent with small vessel
     ischemic change. There is no shift of normally midline structures or
     hydrocephalus.  The visualized paranasal sinuses and osseous structures are
     unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Extensive intraventricular hemorrhage surrounding a corpus callosum
     hematoma. The differential diagnosis would include an underlying vascular
     malformation, a ruptured aneurysm, esp a mycotic aneurysm, or a bleeding
     neoplasm. An MRI may be helpful for further evaluation.
     2.  Chronic small vessel ischemic change.
