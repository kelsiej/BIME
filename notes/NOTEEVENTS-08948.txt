Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2122**] 
Chief Complaint:
N/V/D, hyperglycemia
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

 
History of Present Illness:
73F with DM1, h/o DKA in past, HTN, COPD, depression who 
presented to ED with N/V/D. Pt reports feeling her usual self 
until after dinner yesterday (frozen dinner, no seafood) when 
she developed nausea, emesis, and diarrhea, all of which lasted 
through the night into the morning. Emesis was initially of her 
supper contents then mainly dry heaves and w/o any blood. 
Diarrhea was brown w/o blood or black stool. Pt was unable to 
tolerate much PO intake during this time. Pt also developed 
epigastric pain with the emesis.
<br>
Pt reports that her FS glucoses at home were in the 500 range 
all day yesterday, which she states is NOT unusual for her. Her 
FS glucose usually ranges in the 200-300s. Lowest value that pt 
remembers in the past several weeks is in the high 100s. Today, 
pt took her usual 20U glargine at ~noontime but did not take ANY 
Humalog SS (despite the FS glucoses in the 500s) because she 
states that she has been instructed not to take Humalog unless 
she can eat food (which she could not today due to nausea).
<br>
Per OMR and [**Last Name (un) **] notes, pt has had very poorly controlled 
sugars x years, with most recent A1c of 13.8%. Pt reports being 
in the hospital with DKA many times in the past, most recently 
in [**3233-6-15**].
<br>
In ED, serum glucose 1142, bicarb 12, AG 33 so she was started 
on IVF and insulin drip. K+ was initially 6.7 (and pt rec'd Ca++ 
gluconate) but trended down to 4.7 and 4.3 with insulin.
<br>
Denies headache, URI Sx, sore throat, SOB, chest pain, palpit, 
or urinary Sx. Has chronic cough, currently unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
73 yo F with DM-I (x30 yrs) who was admitted with DKA (gluc 
1142, HCO3 12, AG 33) and acute renal failure due to poor 
compliance with her insulin regimen.  She fears the low BS's and 
she does not use her humalog regularly.  her baseline HbA1c = 
13.8%.  No infectious cause for her DKA was found.  Given her 
poor insulin compliance, her DKA was felt to be due to lack of 
insulin.  She was hydrated, started on an insulin drip, and 
admitted to the intensive care unit.  Her renal failure quickly 
resolved, and her anion gap closed as well.  She was seen by the 
[**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes Consult [**Last Name (un) 12507**], and restarted on Glargine.  She 
has had VNA in the past and refused VNA on this admission.  She 
agrees to follow the sliding scale of humalog which starts with 
2 units for a FSBS of 151-200 and increases by 2 units every 50 
points.  This are her meal-time doses.  At night, her sliding 
scale starts with 2 units for a FSBS of 251-300.
.
She was also noted to have a bone density study that revealed 
osteoporosis, and she was discharegd on calcium carbonate 500 mg 
TID with meals, Vitamin D 800 units daily, and Fosamax 70 mg 
once weekly.  She will follow-up with her endocrinologist within 
7-10 days.
 
Medications on Admission:
-Insulin: glargine 20U qAM + Humalog SS
-ASA 325 daily
-Combivent 4 puff QID

     EXAM:  MRI of the brain and MRA of the head.
     
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with brain aneurysms seen on outside hospital
     scan for further evaluation.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  T1 sagittal and FLAIR, T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial
     images of the brain were obtained.  3D time-of-flight MRA of the circle of
     [**Location (un) 220**] was acquired.
     
     FINDINGS:  BRAIN MRI:
     
     On diffusion images, increased signal is seen in the left corona radiata
     region indicating T2 shine-through.  No abnormalities are seen in this region
     on ADC map to indicate acute infarct.  There are mild changes of small vessel
     disease seen in the periventricular white matter.  Mild-to-moderate brain
     atrophy is identified.  There is no midline shift, mass effect, or
     hydrocephalus seen.  Suprasellar and craniocervical regions are normal on the
     sagittal images.  The T2 images demonstrate abnormal flow voids in the region
     of both middle cerebral artery bifurcation regions indicative of bilateral MCA
     aneurysm.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Mild changes of small vessel disease and mild to moderate brain
     atrophy.  No evidence of acute infarct, mass effect, or hydrocephalus.
     Abnormal flow voids in the region of MCA bifurcation bilaterally indicating
     aneurysms.
     
     MRA OF THE HEAD:
     
     The head MRA demonstrates an approximately 8 mm aneurysm in the region of
     right MCA bifurcation and approximately 5-mm aneurysm is visualized in the
     region of left MCA bifurcation.  No other aneurysms are identified.  No
     vascular occlusion or stenosis is seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Bilateral middle cerebral artery bifurcation aneurysms as

      73 year old woman with left ICA aneurysm.                                       
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Coiling vs. clipping.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  73-year-old woman with bilateral cerebral aneurysms.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3134**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1170**] who was present and supervising
     throughout the procedure.
     
     FINDINGS/TECHNIQUE:  The informed consent was obtained from the patient after
     explaining the risks, indications, and alternative management.  Risks
     explained included stroke, loss of vision and speech, temporary or permanent,
     with possible treatment with stent and coils if needed.
     
     The patient was brought to the interventional neuroradiology suite and placed
     on the biplane table in supine position.  The right groin was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Access to the right common femoral
     artery was obtained using a 19-gauge single-wall needle under local anesthesia
     using 1% lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate.  Through the needle, a 0.035
     [**Last Name (un) 223**] wire was introduced and the needle was taken out.  Over the wire, a 5-
     French vascular sheath was placed and connected to the side-arm continuous
     flush with heparinized saline.  Through the sheath, a 4-French Berenstein
     catheter was introduced and connected to a continuous saline infusion.
     
     The following vessels were selectively catheterized and arteriograms were
     performed from these locations in frontal and lateral planes:
     
     Right and left common carotid arteries, right and left internal carotid
     arteries, and right and left vertebral arteries.
     
     FINDINGS:  Evaluation of the above vessels demonstrated broad-based aneurysm
     in the right middle cerebral artery at the bifurcation measuring 8 mm in
     diameter with adjacent daughter aneurysm measuring 2 mm in diameter.  In
     addition, a 4- mm aneurysm was demonstrated in the left middle cerebral artery
     at the bifurcation with a daughter aneurysm measuring 2 mm in diameter.
     Pericallosal broad-based aneurysm was also demonstrated measuring 1 mm in
     diameter.
                                                                 (Over)

      73 year old woman with left ICA aneurysm.                                       
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Coiling vs. clipping.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  73-year-old woman with bilateral cerebral aneurysms.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3134**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1170**] who was present and supervising
     throughout the procedure.
     
     FINDINGS/TECHNIQUE:  The informed consent was obtained from the patient after
     explaining the risks, indications, and alternative management.  Risks
     explained included stroke, loss of vision and speech, temporary or permanent,
     with possible treatment with stent and coils if needed.
     
     The patient was brought to the interventional neuroradiology suite and placed
     on the biplane table in supine position.  The right groin was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Access to the right common femoral
     artery was obtained using a 19-gauge single-wall needle under local anesthesia
     using 1% lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate.  Through the needle, a 0.035
     [**Last Name (un) 223**] wire was introduced and the needle was taken out.  Over the wire, a 5-
     French vascular sheath was placed and connected to the side-arm continuous
     flush with heparinized saline.  Through the sheath, a 4-French Berenstein
     catheter was introduced and connected to a continuous saline infusion.
     
     The following vessels were selectively catheterized and arteriograms were
     performed from these locations in frontal and lateral planes:
     
     Right and left common carotid arteries, right and left internal carotid
     arteries, and right and left vertebral arteries.
     
     FINDINGS:  Evaluation of the above vessels demonstrated broad-based aneurysm
     in the right middle cerebral artery at the bifurcation measuring 8 mm in
     diameter with adjacent daughter aneurysm measuring 2 mm in diameter.  In
     addition, a 4- mm aneurysm was demonstrated in the left middle cerebral artery
     at the bifurcation with a daughter aneurysm measuring 2 mm in diameter.
     Pericallosal broad-based aneurysm was also demonstrated measuring 1 mm in
     diameter.
                                                                 (Over)

     The patient was brought to the interventional neuroradiology suite and placed
     on the biplane table in supine position.  The right groin was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Access to the right common femoral
     artery was obtained using a 19-gauge single-wall needle under local anesthesia
     using 1% lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate.  Through the needle, a 0.035
     [**Last Name (un) 223**] wire was introduced and the needle was taken out.  Over the wire, a 5-
     French vascular sheath was placed and connected to the side-arm continuous
     flush with heparinized saline.  Through the sheath, a 4-French Berenstein
     catheter was introduced and connected to a continuous saline infusion.
     
     The following vessels were selectively catheterized and arteriograms were
     performed from these locations in frontal and lateral planes:
     
     Right and left common carotid arteries, right and left internal carotid
     arteries, and right and left vertebral arteries.
     
     FINDINGS:  Evaluation of the above vessels demonstrated broad-based aneurysm
     in the right middle cerebral artery at the bifurcation measuring 8 mm in
     diameter with adjacent daughter aneurysm measuring 2 mm in diameter.  In
     addition, a 4- mm aneurysm was demonstrated in the left middle cerebral artery
     at the bifurcation with a daughter aneurysm measuring 2 mm in diameter.
     Pericallosal broad-based aneurysm was also demonstrated measuring 1 mm in
     diameter.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  The patient is approximately 2 hours post right MCA bifurcation
     aneurysm clipping. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1157**] requests cerebral angiography to assess patency
     of the MCA branches
     
     PHYSICIANS:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 60**] [**Doctor Last Name 41**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the attending
     physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 7**] supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Following written informed consent, the patient was positioned
     supine on the Biplane neuroangiography table.  Pre-procedure timeout was
     performed to confirm patient, procedure, and site.  Standard sterile prep and
     drape of the inguinal regions bilaterally.  Local anesthesia with 5 cc of 1%
     lidocaine subcutaneously.  The patient was intubated under general
     endotracheal anesthesia from the OR.  Using palpatory and fluoroscopic
     guidance, a 21-gauge single wall puncture of the right common femoral artery
     was performed.  A 0.018-inch guidewire was advanced through the needle into
     the abdominal aorta using fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was exchanged for
     the micropuncture sheath and the wire was exchanged for a 0.035-inch
     guidewire.  The sheath was then exchanged for a 5-French vascular sheath,
     which was attached to continuous heparinized saline flush.  Using a Berenstein
     II catheter, the right internal carotid artery was selected under roadmap
     conditions.  Right internal carotid arteriography was performed in the frontal
     and lateral projections and then 360 degree rotational angiogram was
     performed.  All wires, catheters, and the sheath were removed and hemostasis
     was ensured with direct manual compression.  There were no immediate
     complications.
     
     Approximately 80 cc of contrast was utilized.
     
     FINDINGS:  There are diffuse atherosclerotic changes with calcifications.  An
     atherosclerotic plaque is present in the origin of the right internal carotid
     artery with less than 50% stenosis by diameter.
     
     The right MCA and its branches fill briskly without evidence of branch
     occlusion
     
     Three aneurysm clips are seen in the region of the right MCA bifurcation
     aneurysm.  There is residual aneurysm filling medially and inferiorly to the

      73 year old woman with s/p aneurysm clipping                                    
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      evaluate for perfusion                                                          
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  The patient is approximately 2 hours post right MCA bifurcation
     aneurysm clipping. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1157**] requests cerebral angiography to assess patency
     of the MCA branches
     
     PHYSICIANS:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 60**] [**Doctor Last Name 41**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the attending
     physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 7**] supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Following written informed consent, the patient was positioned
     supine on the Biplane neuroangiography table.  Pre-procedure timeout was
     performed to confirm patient, procedure, and site.  Standard sterile prep and
     drape of the inguinal regions bilaterally.  Local anesthesia with 5 cc of 1%
     lidocaine subcutaneously.  The patient was intubated under general
     endotracheal anesthesia from the OR.  Using palpatory and fluoroscopic
     guidance, a 21-gauge single wall puncture of the right common femoral artery
     was performed.  A 0.018-inch guidewire was advanced through the needle into
     the abdominal aorta using fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was exchanged for
     the micropuncture sheath and the wire was exchanged for a 0.035-inch
     guidewire.  The sheath was then exchanged for a 5-French vascular sheath,
     which was attached to continuous heparinized saline flush.  Using a Berenstein
     II catheter, the right internal carotid artery was selected under roadmap
     conditions.  Right internal carotid arteriography was performed in the frontal
     and lateral projections and then 360 degree rotational angiogram was
     performed.  All wires, catheters, and the sheath were removed and hemostasis
     was ensured with direct manual compression.  There were no immediate
     complications.
     
     Approximately 80 cc of contrast was utilized.
     
     FINDINGS:  There are diffuse atherosclerotic changes with calcifications.  An
     atherosclerotic plaque is present in the origin of the right internal carotid
     artery with less than 50% stenosis by diameter.
     
     The right MCA and its branches fill briskly without evidence of branch
     occlusion
     
     Three aneurysm clips are seen in the region of the right MCA bifurcation
     aneurysm.  There is residual aneurysm filling medially and inferiorly to the
                                                                 (Over)

     COMPARISON:  [**3234-6-30**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT scan.
     
     FINDINGS:  Study is limited by patient motion and artifact from high-density
     aneurysm clips again seen in the right MCA territory.  Compared to prior
     study, there appears to be slight interval decrease in the amount of
     postoperative pneumocephalus.
     
     Again seen is postoperative fluid in the extra-axial space. No definite new
     areas of hemorrhage are identified. Again seen is slight mass effect on the
     right lateral ventricle as well as slight leftward shift of normally midline
     structures.  [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation appears grossly preserved.
     Again noted are staples in the right frontotemporal scalp and subcutaneous
     emphysema.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Study limited by patient motion; however, no definite evidence of
     new intracranial hemorrhage.  Slight interval decrease in previously seen
     pneumocephalus.  Interval evolution of small right-sided postoperative
     subdural.

     HISTORY:  Cerebral aneurysm.  Check ET tube placement.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**3234-6-19**]:
     
     Tip of the endotracheal tube is approximately 2 cm above the carina.  Tip of
     the left internal jugular line projects over the junction of the

     CLINICAL HISTORY:  Right MCA aneurysm clipping.  Decreased mental status.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous scans were obtained from the skull base to the vertex.
     
     The resolution of the study is lower than normal and a helical algorithm may
     have been used.
     
     There is considerable artifact from aneurysm clips in the region of the right
     MCA bifurcation.  Low attenuation is seen in the nearby anterior right
     temporal lobe, unchanged from the preceding day.  There is an overlying
     subdural collection that measures as much as 8 mm in thickness, without
     significant change.  Much of the subdural fluid is low in attenuation.  There
     is also high-attenuation blood.  The craniotomy, overlying scalp soft tissue
     swelling and surgical staples are noted.  There is an approximately 6-mm
     partially calcified lesion at the left MCA bifurcation region corresponding to
     the aneurysm seen on prior angiography.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  There is no significant change from the study of [**3234-7-1**].
     
     2.  There is a postoperative right-sided subdural collection with some mass
     effect on the ventricular system with no shift of midline structures or
     change.
     
     3.  Postoperative changes are seen in the right temporal lobe.
     
     4.  There is a known left MCA aneurysm.

     73-year-old female status post right middle cerebral artery aneurysm clipping,
     now with decreased mental status and new left temporal lobe infarction.
     
     COMPARISON:  Head CT [**3234-7-2**], and cerebral angiograms [**3234-6-30**] and
     [**3234-5-23**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT continuously acquired axial images of the head were obtained
     after Optiray IV contrast administration.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted
     images as well as three-dimensional reconstructions were performed.
     
     CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE HEAD WITH IV CONTRAST:  Again demonstrated are three
     aneurysm clips in the region of the right middle cerebral artery bifurcation
     aneurysm.  There remains a residual aneurysm filling medially and inferiorly
     to the clips not significantly changed from recent cerebral angiogram.  Also
     stable are two smaller aneurysms measuring approximately 2 mm each arising
     from the pericallosal artery on the right.  A 4 mm aneurysm with a 2 mm
     daughter aneurysm is again seen at the bifurcation of the left middle cerebral
     artery, also unchanged.  The branches distal to the middle cerebral artery
     bifurcations opacify well and are patent bilaterally.  Similarly, the anterior
     cerebral and posterior cerebral artery circulations appear patent and are
     unremarkable.  There is no evidence of dissection or aneurysm of the
     vertebrobasilar system.  The left vertebral artery is dominant.  Extensive
     atherosclerotic calcifications are noted of the internal carotid arteries
     bilaterally at the level just proximal to the circle of [**Location (un) 220**].
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No significant change in right middle cerebral artery bifurcation aneurysm
     and associated small daughter aneurysm as well as two small aneurysms arising
     from the pericallosal artery on the right in comparison to cerebral angiogram
     [**3234-6-30**].

     AP CHEST, 11:59 A.M. ON [**7-12**]
     
     HISTORY:  Cerebral aneurysm.  Tracheostomy.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**7-2**] through 27:
     
     Mild pulmonary edema has almost cleared while small left and moderate right
     pleural effusion persists.  Left lower lobe collapse has recurred.  Heart size
     is normal.  Tracheostomy tube extends approximately 8 cm from the orifice, 3.5
     cm from the carina.  Tip of the left subclavian catheter projects over the
     junction of the brachiocephalic veins.  No pneumothorax or mediastinal
     widening.  Subcutaneous emphysema in the left lower chest wall is new.  Since
     this is remote from the operative site, clinical evaluation is recommended to
     exclude source of gas below the diaphragm or in soft tissues.  Dr. _____ was
     paged to report these findings at the time of dictation.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  73-year-old with distended abdomen.
     
     A single frontal supine view of the abdomen compared to [**3234-2-25**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There is a new percutaneous gastrostomy tube.  The stomach is
     dilated.  There is no abnormal dilation of large or small bowel loops.  An
     unusual curvilinear lucency is seen extending across the midline under the
     diaphragm.  A triangular-shaped lucency is also seen in the mid abdomen, right
     of midline.  Osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     Atelectatic changes are seen at the left lung base.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Unusual curvilinear lucency seen across the midline under the diaphragm.  This
     is not typical for pneumoperitoneum, but if there is concern for
     pneumoperitoneum, upright films or lateral decubitus films are recommended to
     fully exclude this possibility. No obstruction.
     
     Mild gastric distention. Findings were discussed at approximately 9am with
     Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 11970**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11971**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 11972**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11973**].

     73-year-old female status post right MCA aneurysm clipping, referred for
     followup evaluation.
     
     COMPARISON:  Noncontrast head CT [**3234-7-2**] and CT angiogram of the head
     [**3234-7-4**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  This study is limited by considerable streak artifact from the
     aneurysm clips in the region of the right MCA bifurcation.  Again demonstrated
     is low density in the region of the clips which is unchanged.  The overlying
     right frontal subdural collection is also stable.  There is no evidence of new
     foci of intracranial hemorrhage.  There is no shift of normally midline
     structures.  There is no evidence of hydrocephalus.  Again demonstrated is the
     right frontal craniotomy and regional scalp soft tissue swelling.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No significant change from prior studies, [**7-2**] and [**3234-7-4**].  No new mass effect or new foci of intracranial hemorrhage identified.
     Status post right MCA bifurcation aneurysm clipping with stable right frontal
     subdural collection and postsurgical changes.

     RADIOLOGIST:  The procedure was performed by Doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 1129**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 389**].  Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 389**], the attending radiologist, was present for the entire procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The patient was placed supine on the angiography table.  The right
     arm was prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion, including the
     previously placed PICC line which was currently clogged.
     
     The PICC line within the right arm was cut and an introducer wire and Nitinol
     wire could not be passed through the PICC.  Subsequently, a glidewire was
     passed through the catheter into the peripheral vein.  The catheter was then
     removed over the wire and a 4- French introducer sheath was inserted into the
     superficial vein in the right arm. The 0.018 guidewire was then reinserted
     until the tip was within the superior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.
     According to the marks on the wire, a single lumen, 4- French PICC line was
     trimmed to 51 cm and inserted over the wire until the tip lie within the mid
     superior vena cava. The catheter was capped, heplocked and secured with a
     StatLock device.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Single lumen, 4-French PICC exchanged with the tip in the mid SVC
     via a right arm superficial vein.  The line is ready for use.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  73-year-old with bilateral middle cerebral artery aneurysms, post
     clipping and resection of right aneurysm.  Now with mental status changes.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images of the brain including
     axial FLAIR, susceptibility, and diffusion-weighted sequences.  MR angiogram
     of the brain with 3D time-of-flight imaging and multiplanar reformats.
     
     Comparison is made to CT performed [**3234-7-15**], cerebral angiogram performed
     [**3234-5-23**], and MRI/MRA of the brain performed [**3234-4-1**].
     
     MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:
     Right frontal subdural T2 hyperintense collection and extracranial post-
     surgical changes are unchanged compared to the prior CT scan.  The extent of
     mass effect on underlying brain parenchyma is unchanged.  There is no new
     infarction.  Areas of periventricular and subcortical white matter increased
     FLAIR and T2 -signal intensity consistent with small vessel ischemic changes
     are stable.  Susceptibility artifact with blooming is seen in the right
     frontal and inferior temporal lobes from aneurysm clipping and renders these
     areas unevaluable.  No new area of restricted diffusion is seen.
     
     There is circumferential mucosal thickening with a fluid level seen in the
     sphenoid sinus, mild-to-moderate mucosal thickening in the ethmoid sinus, a
     fluid level and circumferential mucosal thickening in the right frontal sinus,
     and near complete opacification of both mastoid air cells.  There is also mild
     circumferential mucosal thickening and probably a mucus retention cyst or
     polyp in the left maxillary sinus.  Extent of sinus opacification has
     increased since the prior examination.
     
     MR ANGIOGRAM OF THE BRAIN:
     There has been interval clipping of the previously seen right middle cerebral
     artery aneurysm.  The somewhat multilobulated aneurysm at the left middle
     cerebral artery bifurcation is unchanged.  The small right pericallosal artery
     aneurysm seen on prior conventional angiogram is not appreciated on this
     examination.  There is fetal origin of the right posterior cerebral artery.
     Normal flow-signal intensity is seen in both vertebral and basilar arteries,
     both internal carotid arteries, the left middle cerebral artery, both anterior
     cerebral arteries, and both posterior cerebral arteries. Flow-signal intensity
     is seen in the right middle cerebral artery in the M1 segment up to the level
     of aneurysm clipping.

     AP CHEST, 8:26 A.M., [**7-24**]
     
     HISTORY:  Cerebral aneurysm.  Left lower lobe rales.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**7-12**] and 30:
     
     Mild pulmonary edema has nearly resolved, while small bilateral pleural
     effusions, left greater than right, have decreased slightly since [**7-14**].
     
     Heart is normal size and mediastinum is midline.  Tracheostomy tube and right
     PICC catheter are in standard placements.  No pneumothorax.

     Reason: Post op evaluation s/p aneurysm clipping [**3234-6-30**].

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      73 year old woman s/p aneurysm clipping.                                        
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Post op evaluation s/p aneurysm clipping [**3234-6-30**].

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST
     
     HISTORY: 73-year-old woman status post aneurysm clipping on [**3234-6-30**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous 5 mm axial tomographic sections were obtained from the
     skull base to the vertex and viewed in brain window on the workstation;
     several of the additional images were degraded by motion artifact and were
     repeated.
     
     FINDINGS:  The study is compared with the postoperative examination dated
     [**3234-7-15**]; again, the study is limited by significant metallic streak
     artifact emanating from the surgical clip in the region of the right MCA
     bifurcation.  Allowing for this, there is no evidence of intra- or extra-axial
     hemorrhage at this site or elsewhere in the brain.  There is a thin, 5 mm,
     right frontal extra-axial fluid collection with minimal mass effect on the
     subjacent brain and no midline shift, improved.  The large postoperative left
     frontal subgaleal collection has resolved completely.  Noted are expected
     encephalomalacic changes involving the right temporal lobe with volume loss
     and ex vacuo dilatation of the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 234**] and atrium of the ipsilateral
     lateral ventricle.  There is relatively mild chronic microischemic change in
     periventricular white matter, particularly adjacent to the frontal horns.
     There is no finding to suggest acute infarction.
     
     Noted is dense mural calcification involving the cavernous and supraclinoid
     segments of both internal carotid arteries.  Also noted is a partially rim
     calcified, round 8 mm structure in the left Sylvian cistern, in the expected
     region of the left MCA bifurcation, corresponding to known aneurysm at this
     site.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Status post apparent right MCA bifurcation aneurysm clipping in [**6-/3234**],
     with expected progression of postoperative changes involving the right middle
     cranial fossa.
     2.  No new intra- or or extra-axial hemorrhage.
     3.  Interval resolution of the left frontal scalp fluid collection.
     4.  Evidence of known 7 mm left MCA bifurcation aneurysm.
