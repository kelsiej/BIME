     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      50 year old man with cough and hemoptysis.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Patient with history of heart valve replacement, and intra-thoracic seminoma
      treated with chemotherapy, HIV-positive. Having cough with some hemoptysis.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Patient with history of heart valve replacement. History of
     intrathoracic seminoma treated with chemotherapy, HIV+. Presents with cough
     and hemoptysis. Comparison is made to prior exam of [**2918-7-5**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
     unremarkable. The pulmonary vascularity is normal. There are no pleural
     effusions. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. In the left lower lung zone
     on the anterior view, just above the left costophrenic angle, there is an area
     of patchy opacity. However, in the lateral view this is not well seen. The
     soft tissue and osseous structures are unremarkable. The lung fields are
     otherwise unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Small area of patchy opacity over the left costophrenic angle, possibly
     artifactual in nature.  Suggest short term follow up examination. Clinical
     correlation is recommended.

     CHEST CT:
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  50 year old man with history of tobacco use, also with
     HIV, history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma and now with bilateral
     lower extremity swelling.  Evaluate for pulmonary embolism.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung bases through the lung apices following the administration of 100 cc of
     Optiray contrast IV per the CTA protocol.  In addition, multiplanar
     reconstructions were performed.
     
     COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with the upper most slices of an abdominal CT
     obtained on [**2919-6-20**].
     
     CHEST CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  No filling defects are identified within the
     pulmonary arteries to suggest the presence of pulmonary embolism.  The patient
     is s/p mitral valve replacement.  The heart is otherwise normal in appearance
     with no pericardial effusion.  There are no pleural effusions.  No
     pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are identified in the mediastinum, hilar
     or axillary regions, though there are small hilar lymph nodes bilaterally.
     Lung windows reveal multiple pulmonary nodules, some of which are well
     circumscribed and others of which are less well defined and demonstrate
     associated ground-glass opacities.  At least one is cavitary. These nodules
     are peripherally located, predominantly at the lung bases.  The nodules at the
     lung bases are new since the patient's prior study of [**2919-6-20**].  There is
     extensive emphysema of the upper lobes bilaterally.  No focal areas of
     consolidation are identified. There is no pneumothorax.  There is minor
     scarring at the right apex.  No destructive bone lesions are identified in
     this patient s/p median sternotomy.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  No CT evidence of pulmonary embolism.
     2)  Patchy peripheral and basilar pulmonary nodules, new since the prior CT
     exam, at least one of which is cavitary.  The differential diagnosis for this
     appearance is broad and includes BOOP and septic emboli, particularly in a
     patient with history of HIV. Squamous cell metastases and Kaposi's sarcoma
     could also have this appearance. In an immunocompromised patient, an
     inflammatory process such as pneumocystis infection should also be considered.
     The radiologic differential also includes eosinophilic pneumonia and sarcoid.
                                                                 (Over)

Date of Birth:   [**2869-7-9**]       Sex:  M

Service:  ACOVE
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  This is a 50 year old male who was a direct
admission for hemoptysis, blood tinged sputum and increasing
shortness of breath.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
2.  HIV, last CD4 count [**2919-8-16**], was 151 with a viral load
    of 423.
3.  History of anus squamous cell carcinoma, status post
    chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
5.  Mitral valve replacement in [**2911**], with a porcine valve.
    Echocardiogram in 01/02, showed some mitral regurgitation,
6.  Peripheral neuropathy.

11. Atrial flutter.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient had increased
shortness of breath over more than the week.  He was seen in
Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 10553**] office on [**2919-8-17**], for hemoptysis that was
half blood and half sputum.  Initially, the chest x-ray may
have shown left pneumonia for which he was treated with ten
days of Levofloxacin 250 mg per day.  The patient says that
during the course of antibiotics he had decreased hemoptysis.
CT on [**2919-8-29**], showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus but
did show increased pulmonary nodules with a ground glass
appearance.  The patient denied any chest pain but did feel
that he had increased pulsations in the neck over the last
few days.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He has positive constipation since
radiation therapy for his anal cancer.  He also complains of
pain in his legs and scrotal area from lymphedema post
radiation therapy for his cancer that has lasted over the
last two months.  He has not obtained good pain control.  He
denies any fever, chills, sweats, diarrhea or dysuria.

25. Duragesic 25 mcg per hour q72hours.

ALLERGIES:  The patient had no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Alcohol occasionally and now less than one
pack per day of cigarettes.  He smokes marijuana every day.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother died of an inner ear cancer.  Father
had diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease and brother
has alcohol abuse.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On examination, the patient was
afebrile at 98.4, blood pressure 106/72, respiratory rate 28,
pulse 120.  Initially on presentation, he was only saturating
at 83% in room air.  After giving him three liters nasal
cannula, he saturated to 92%.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat examination -  He had moist mucous membranes.  Jugular
venous pressure to the angle of the jaw.  His skin had woody
lymphedema, left leg greater than the right with positive
scrotal edema.  He has no Kaposi lesions.  Respiratory- He
had good air entry bilaterally but he had bilateral fine
crackles at the bases and some bronchial breath sounds at the
right upper lobe.  Cardiovascular examination - harsh III/VI
systolic ejection murmur at the base and left sternal border.
The abdomen has positive bowel sounds, nontender,
nondistended, no organomegaly.  His extremities showed
nonpitting edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 8,7, platelet count
157,000.  Electrolytes were essentially unremarkable.
Neutrophils 75%.

CT of the chest on [**2919-8-29**], showed multiple pulmonary
nodules, associated ground glass opacities, new lung nodules
at the bases compared to [**2919-6-20**], minor scarring at the
right apex.  No evidence of pulmonary embolus.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was put on respiratory
precautions for his increasing shortness of breath with
hemoptysis.  He was ruled out for tuberculosis and multiple
induced sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage from his
bronchoscopy sent for cytology and bacterial and fungal viral
infection.  Essentially, his bronchoalveolar lavage had
negative cytology for malignant cells.  His cryptococcal
antigen was negative.  Three sets of acid fast bacilli and
cultures were negative.  Coccidiodes was still pending to
date.  His still antigen is negative.  His sputum culture
only grew sparse growth of yeast.  Fungal cultures were
negative.  Legionella was negative.  PCP was tested for and
was negative.  Nocardia negative.  Urine culture times two
negative.  Blood cultures and fungal cultures no growth to
date.

The patient obtained a transthoracic echocardiogram which
showed an ejection fraction of 50% and akinesis of the apex
and paradoxical motion of the interventricular septum.  He
had some right ventricular hypertrophy with mild to moderate
aortic regurgitation, moderate to severe tricuspid
regurgitation and at least some mild pulmonary hypertension.

Because all his laboratories were essentially negative for an
infectious disease workup, the patient was scheduled for a
VATS procedure and a Transesophageal Echocardiogram while
under general anesthesia.  The patient went for the VATS
procedure on [**2919-9-6**], and failed extubation with pCO2 in the
90s.  The patient was reintubated and transferred from te
Post Anesthesia Care Unit to the SICU on Neo-Synephrine and
pressure support of 10/5.  The Neo-Synephrine was
discontinued after twelve hours and the patient was
successfully extubated.  His last arterial blood gas on
[**2919-9-8**], was pH 7.35/57/85.  The patient's VATS had
demonstrated metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.  The
Transesophageal Echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection
fraction of greater than 55%, left atrial dilatation, 2+
aortic regurgitation, no mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid
regurgitation and no pericardial effusion, and a prosthetic
mitral valve.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 586**] spoke with the patient about his diagnosis of
metastatic squamous cell carcinoma to the lung.  It was
agreed with the patient that he would be discharged with
Hospice care and no further intervention was to be pursued.

The patient was discontinued on all his antiretroviral
treatments and was only continued on pain control management
anxiety control medications and his antidepressant medication
as well as supplemental oxygen.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is DNR/DNI.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Fentanyl patch 50 mcg/hour q72hours.
2.  Marinol 2 to 5 mg p.o. twice a day.
3.  Ativan 1 to 2 mg p.o. q4-8hours p.r.n.
4.  Wellbutrin SR 100 mg p.o. once daily.
5.  Proventil 90 mcg two puffs q4hours p.r.n. for cough.
6.  Home supplemental oxygen to titrate to comfort.
7.  Dilaudid 2 to 4 mg p.o. q2-4hours p.r.n.
8.  Neurontin 300 mg p.o. three times a day.

The patient is to be admitted to Hospice/Palliative Care at
Beacon Hospice.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma to the lung.
2.  AIDS.
3.  Hepatitis C.
4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

     PA AND LATERAL CHEST:  Comparison is made to previous films from  [**2919-8-17**].
     The patient has prior MBR and median sternotomy.
     
     Note is made of increased nodular and linear opacities involving the right
     upper lobe and left lower lobe. In this patient with HIV and history of
     chemotherapy for seminoma, these findings are worrisome for chronic infection
     including fungus or microbacterial infection. Further evaluation with CT scan
     is recommended.  There is slight prominence of the left hilum.  The patchy
     opacity in the left lower lobe could represent bronchopneumonia.  The heart
     is normal in size. There is no evidence for CHF. No pneumothorax is
     identified. 
     
     IMPRESSION:  Increased nausea and linear opacities involving the right upper
     lobe and left lower lobe, please see comment for discussion.

     HISTORY: Cough and hemoptysis. Progressive increased O2 requirement. Shortness
     of breath.
     
     CHEST, 2 VIEWS: Comparison [**2919-8-31**]. The patient is s/p sternotomy and valve
     replacement. There is no significant change in appearance of the linear and
     nodular opacities seen throughout the lungs, most marked in the left lower
     lobe. There is a larger vague nodular density seen in the right mid lung zone,
     near the minor fissure. There is prominence of the left hilum, unchanged.
     There is no new focal area of consolidation and there are no pleural
     effusions.
     
     IMPRESSION: No significant change from [**2919-8-31**]. Note that the patient had a CT
     scan on [**2919-8-29**] which better delineated the pulmonary nodules and adenopathy.
     This is reported separately.

     Comparison is made to study of the previous morning.
     
     FINDINGS:  The mediastinum, vascular clips and prosthetic mitral valve are
     unchanged.  A left-sided chest tube is again seen with tip in the left apex. A
     small left-sided pneumothorax is seen tracking along the superior and lateral
     aspect of the lung.  Subcutaneous air is seen along the left chest wall. There
     is ill-defined increased density throughout the left lung which likely relates
     to atelectasis and inflammation from the recent procedure. There is a decrease
     in the amount of pleural fluid on the left.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Small left-sided pneumothorax tracking superiorly and laterally.
     2)  Stable post-op changes in the left hemithorax.
