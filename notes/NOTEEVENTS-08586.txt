Admission Date:  [**3299-2-3**]       Discharge Date:  [**3299-2-11**]

Date of Birth:   [**3262-3-19**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CARDIAC INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an unfortunate
36-year-old, gravida 2, para 2, [**Location 5881**] speaking female
with a past medical history of sinus venosus ASD, anomalous
pulmonary return and Eisenmenger's physiology, which was
diagnosed in [**3296**]-2002, on home oxygen, who presented with
chest pain and shortness of breath on [**2-3**].

The patient was initially admitted to a medical floor with
oxygen saturations of 88% on 100% nonrebreather.  At the time
of presentation, review of systems was positive for dyspnea
on exertion, shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain,
chronic fevers, however, no syncope or palpitations.  The
patient of note, may have had mechanical difficulty with her
home oxygen equipment.

During the initial work-up, a CT angiogram was positive for
progression of her known pulmonary embolus despite a
therapeutic INR.  She was started on Lovenox on the medical
floor.  She was peristently hypoxemic with obvious increased
work of breathing.  The decision was made to see if pulmonary
vasodilators would improve her condition and hemodynamic
assessment was planned in the cardiac catheterization
laboratory.

The patient was brought to the Catheterization Lab on
[**2-6**] for a right heart catheterization. She was noted
initially to become nearly unresponsive on transfer to the scale
for weighing, but spontaneously resolved.  During the
catheterization, her right atrial pressures were noted to be
elevated, right ventricle systolic pressure of 100, pulmonary
arterial pressure of 100-110, mean pulmonary artery pressure in
the 70s.  She had a systemic pAO2 of 25, with a +/- response to a
nitric-oxide trial.  Saturations remained in the 40s to 50s
despite intervention and there profound right to left shunting
continued.

Due to her severe systemic hypoxemia, obvious cardiogenic shock
and worsening hemodynamics, she was transferred to the Cardiac
Intensive Care Unit where she continued to do rather poorly.  She
was responding to voice but was unable to speak in full
sentences.  Her arterial saturations remained in the 40% range.
Her blood gas returned with a pH of 7.17, CO2 of 41, and a pAO2
of 26.

She did receive some bicarb at that time in an attempt to correct
her acidosis.  CPAP was also initiated to try to increase her
oxygen saturations, and she was also started on Dopamine for
pressor support in an effort to reduce right to left shunt.

She survived throughout the night and was followed by the CCU
Team d[**MD Number 1142**] the rest of her admission.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Eisenmenger's diagnosed in [**3297**].
2.  ASD (sinus venosum).  3.  Home oxygen dependent.  4.
Chronic pulmonary embolus secondary to extreme pulmonary
hypertension.

MEDICATIONS:  Oxygen, Coumadin 2 mg q.d.

ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a single, [**Location 5881**] speaking
woman, who came here about 1�� years ago.  She is an illegal
alien.  She has two children, boy and an 11-year-old
daughter, who live with her father and step-mother in [**Country 11942**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Question of ASD in father/son.  Primary care
physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **], [**Company **].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 97��, blood
pressure 95/52, heart rate 100-130, respirations 30, oxygen
saturation 40-50% on 100% nonrebreather.  General:  Lethargic
and cachectic woman.  HEENT:  JVP at 9-10 cm.  Pupils equal,
round and reactive to light and accommodation.  Oropharynx
dry.  Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation anteriorly.  No
wheezes rubs, or rhonchi.  Cardiovascular:  Hyperdynamic.
Right ventricular heave.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  PMI
5-10 cm.  Abdomen:  Normoactive bowel sounds.  Soft,
nontender, nondistended.  No hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Neurological:
Intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  WBC 10.7, hematocrit 50.9 down from 63 on
admission, platelet count 173; INR 1.8; bicarb 18, sodium
135, potassium 4.1, BUN 10, creatinine 0.6, glucose 87; ALT
12, AST 15, alkaline phosphatase 57, total bilirubin 1;
urinalysis with 26 WBCs, no RBCs; CK of 120, troponin less
than 0.3; HCG quantitative less than 5;

CTA showed increased thickness in extent of mural thrombus
and a markedly dilated proximal pulmonary artery with some
irregularity in the mural thrombus at the bifurcation of the
right pulmonary artery, new small right pleural effusion,
stable, a morphos calcification of the dome of the liver, no
renal stones or abnormal pathology.

Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 92, right
ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization, abnormal V1-V5,
right axis deviation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 36-year-old female with
Eisenmenger's physiology, chronic pulmonary emboli and chest
pain.  The patient with inarguably significant disease now,
who is status post catheterization confirming anatomy and
increased right-sided pressure.  She became clinically much
worse than on admission with depressed oxygen saturations on
100% nonrebreather, with increased symptoms, increased
lethargy, and dismal ABG.

She had partial response to nitric oxide, and Catheterization
Lab suggested possible response to other vasodilators.  She
was therefore started on Flolan 0.5 ng/kg/min the night of
admission as salvage therapy and was slowly titrated up daily to
3 ng/kg/min.

Supportive measures were also begun including Dopamine drip,
which over the next several days was slowly titrated down to
off, a Heparin drip for her PEs, CPAP/oxygen support, packed
red blood cells to increase to oxygen delivery, and Levaquin
was continued for a urinary tract infection.

She was determined to be CPR not indicated secondary to the
irreversibility of her cardiopulmonary anatomy.

She was followed closely by the Pulmonary Hypertension
Service (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]), Pharmacy department, the Ethics Service,
Case Management, and further congenital heart disease input via
telephone was obtained from [**Hospital3 1802**].

Her right pleural effusion was monitored closely via exam and
repeat chest x-ray; however, she was always considered too
high risk for diagnostic or therapeutic tap.

Her many social issues were addressed during her stay in the
CCU.  Family members were found and contacted.  Her cousin,
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 11943**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11944**], was deeply involved.  [**Location 11945**] Embassy
and community in [**Location (un) 210**] were also involved in helping with
translation and providing support for the patient.  An
attempt was made to have her daughter and stepmother, who do
not have visas to visit from [**Country 3702**].  The American
Consulate in [**Country 3702**] was consulted who did decline the
request.  This was then pursued by contacting the U.S.
Embassy.

Discussions of how the patient would afford the Flolan and
have the Flolan administered while she was at home was
initiated during this stay.  She was also determined not to
be eligible for a heart/lung transplant secondary to her
illegal immigrant status in the United States.

She remained somewhat stable, although critically ill for
several days.  Her oxygen saturations remained in the 40-50s,
and it was unclear as to whether the Flolan was providing any
clear benefit at this time.

By [**2-9**], her creatinine had begun to increase.  Renal was
consulted and attributed her acute renal failure to
hypotension, as well as recent administration of intravenous
contrast.  Intravenous fluids were limited in order to try to
prevent fluid overload.  A renal ultrasound revealed
hyperechoic kidneys but no overt obstructions.

Her liver function tests, as well as her amylase and lipase
were noted as well to increase, likely consistent with a
shocked pancreas/liver.  A right upper quadrant ultrasound
revealed an enlarged liver with prominent hepatic but patent
veins.

On the morning of [**2-11**] after morning rounds, we were
called in by the nurse who noted that she had become
unresponsive while she was being turned.  This came on
abruptly.  The patient was noted to be apneic with
[**Last Name (un) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] breathing.  Eyes were deviated to the right
initially and then moved to midline.  The pupils were
unresponsive to light.  She became bradycardiac.  She was
given Morphine for comfort, and slowly her heart rate and
respiration rate decreased.  She expired around 10 a.m.

The likely cause of death clinically seemed to be either
pulmonary embolus or a cerebrovascular accident.  Her family
members were contacted.  Her family in [**Country 3702**] did give
permission for an autopsy, and the death certificate was
filled out.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  Severe right flank pain and chest pain in patient with
     history of pulmonary emboli and history of Eisenmenger's syndrome.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung apices to the
     pubic symphysis.  Precontrast images were obtained from the lung bases to the
     pubic symphysis.  Subsequently, 100 cc of Optiray contrast was injected
     intravenously and a CTA was performed of the lungs.  Delayed images were then
     obtained of the abdomen and pelvis.  No oral contrast was used.
     
     Comparison is made to the prior pulmonary CTA of [**3297-12-19**].
     
     CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST (PULMONARY CTA):  The heart is enlarged and
     unchanged.  The pericardium and aorta are unremarkable.  The central pulmonary
     arteries are again noted to be markedly dilated with diffuse mural thrombus
     and calcifications.  The filling defects representing thrombus have increased
     in size and thickness since the prior study, predominantly in the interlobar
     segments and segments posterior and lateral in the lower lobes.  The filling
     defects are predominantly eccentric and mural which is more suggestive of a
     chronic increase in the thrombotic process as opposed to a recent acute
     pulmonary embolus, though the latter cannot be definitively excluded.
     Associated with the increased wall thrombus is narrowing of the associated
     pulmonary arterial lumen.  Stable atelectasis versus scarring is noted at the
     lung bases and left apex.  No focal consolidations or findings to suggest
     focal infarction of the pulmonary parenchyma are seen.  There is a new small
     right pleural effusion.  A tiny nodule at the right lung base is again seen
     and unchanged.  Multiplanar reformations confirm the above findings.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  An amorphous calcification
     at the liver dome is again seen and unchanged when compared to prior studies.
     The liver is otherwise normal.  The gallbladder, spleen, adrenal glands,
     kidneys, and ureters are normal.  Specifically, no renal stones,
     hydronephrosis, or hydroureter are seen.  The pancreas and visualized loops of
     small and large bowel are unremarkable.  There is no free fluid, free air, or
     lymphadenopathy.
     
     CT PELVIS WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The distal ureters and
     urinary bladder are normal with no renal stones.  The uterus and adnexa are
                                                                 (Over)

     is no lymphadenopathy.
     
     No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions are present.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Interval increase in thickness and extent of mural thrombus in markedly
     dilated proximal pulmonary arteries, with some irregularity in the mural
     thrombus at the bifurcation of the right pulmonary artery.  The abnormality
     appears eccentric and mural which suggests that this may be progression of
     chronic disease, however an acute pulmonary embolism cannot be definitively
     excluded. The heart is stablely enlarged and the pulmonary arteries also are
     stable in their caliber which is consistent with diagnosis of Eisenmenger's
     disease.
     2.  New small right pleural effusion.
     3.  Stable amorphous calcification in the dome of the liver.
     4.  No evidence of renal stones or other acute pathological process in the
     abdomen or pelvis.

     dilated proximal pulmonary arteries, with some irregularity in the mural
     thrombus at the bifurcation of the right pulmonary artery.  The abnormality
     appears eccentric and mural which suggests that this may be progression of
     chronic disease, however an acute pulmonary embolism cannot be definitively
     excluded. The heart is stablely enlarged and the pulmonary arteries also are
     stable in their caliber which is consistent with diagnosis of Eisenmenger's
     disease.
     2.  New small right pleural effusion.
     3.  Stable amorphous calcification in the dome of the liver.
     4.  No evidence of renal stones or other acute pathological process in the
     abdomen or pelvis.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  Severe right flank pain and chest pain in patient with
     history of pulmonary emboli and history of Eisenmenger's syndrome.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung apices to the
     pubic symphysis.  Precontrast images were obtained from the lung bases to the
     pubic symphysis.  Subsequently, 100 cc of Optiray contrast was injected
     intravenously and a CTA was performed of the lungs.  Delayed images were then
     obtained of the abdomen and pelvis.  No oral contrast was used.
     
     Comparison is made to the prior pulmonary CTA of [**3297-12-19**].
     
     CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST (PULMONARY CTA):  The heart is enlarged and
     unchanged.  The pericardium and aorta are unremarkable.  The central pulmonary
     arteries are again noted to be markedly dilated with diffuse mural thrombus
     and calcifications.  The filling defects representing thrombus have increased
     in size and thickness since the prior study, predominantly in the interlobar
     segments and segments posterior and lateral in the lower lobes.  The filling
     defects are predominantly eccentric and mural which is more suggestive of a
     chronic increase in the thrombotic process as opposed to a recent acute
     pulmonary embolus, though the latter cannot be definitively excluded.
     Associated with the increased wall thrombus is narrowing of the associated
     pulmonary arterial lumen.  Stable atelectasis versus scarring is noted at the
     lung bases and left apex.  No focal consolidations or findings to suggest
     focal infarction of the pulmonary parenchyma are seen.  There is a new small
     right pleural effusion.  A tiny nodule at the right lung base is again seen
     and unchanged.  Multiplanar reformations confirm the above findings.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  An amorphous calcification
     at the liver dome is again seen and unchanged when compared to prior studies.
     The liver is otherwise normal.  The gallbladder, spleen, adrenal glands,
     kidneys, and ureters are normal.  Specifically, no renal stones,
     hydronephrosis, or hydroureter are seen.  The pancreas and visualized loops of
     small and large bowel are unremarkable.  There is no free fluid, free air, or
     lymphadenopathy.
     
     CT PELVIS WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The distal ureters and
     urinary bladder are normal with no renal stones.  The uterus and adnexa are
                                                                 (Over)

     PORTABLE AP CHEST: Comparison is made to previous films from  two days
     earlier.
     
     The heart is enlarged. There is massive enlargement of the central pulmonary
     arteries.  New in the interval since the prior radiograph is the presence of a
     moderate sized right pleural effusion. The left lung remains clear.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Massive enlargement of the central pulmonary arteries, consistent with
     pulmonary artery hypertension.  This is in keeping with Eisenmenger's Syndrome
     due to known septal defect.
     
     2. New moderate sized right pleural effusion. It is difficult to exclude
     underlying infection in the right lower lobe.

     HISTORY: Eisenmenger's syndrome. Hypoxia. New fever spike and increasing white
     count.
     
     PORTABLE AP CHEST, ONE VIEW: Comparison [**3299-2-5**]. The heart is markedly
     enlarged. There are large nodular densities in the region of the hila, which
     from prior CT scan were shown to represent pulmonary arteries, unchanged.
     There is opacification of the left lower hemithorax with obscuration of the
     diaphragm. This is consistent with a moderate sized right pleural effusion.
     Underlying infection in the right lower lobe cannot be excluded. The right
     upper lung and left lung are grossly clear and there is no left effusion.
     
     IMPRESSION: No significant change from [**3299-2-5**]. Moderate right effusion.
     Cannot exclude underlying right lower lobe pneumonia. Cardiomegaly with
     markedly enlarged central pulmonary arteries, consistent with history of
     Eisenmenger's syndrome.

     FINDINGS: The right IJ central venous catheter remains in stable, satisfactory
     position. The heart is enlarged. There is marked dilatation of the central
     pulmonary arteries, particularly on the left side, consistent with the
     patient's history of Eizenmenger's syndrome and likely pulmonary hypertension.
     Allowing for the supine technique, there is no pulmonary vascular congestion.
     There is a moderate sized right pleural effusion which appears slightly larger
     in the interval. It is associated with compression atelectasis of the adjacent
     right lower lobe and extends into the minor fissure.
     
     IMPRESSION: Slight interval increase in size of right pleural effusion.
     Otherwise, stable appearance of the chest.
