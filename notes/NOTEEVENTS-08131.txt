Allergies: 
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs
 
Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6203**] 
Chief Complaint:
chest pain
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization, status post placement of drug-eluting 
stents.

 
History of Present Illness:
52 y.o. pt of Dr.[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 70**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], with h/o silent MI in [**2748**], DM, HTN, 
with known 2 vessel disease by OSH cath report transferred to [**Hospital1 **] 
for a possible intervention.
The patient was admitted to the OSH on [**2751-2-18**] with a one-week 
history of nausea and non-bilious non-bloody vomiting. The 
patient also describes symtpoms of fatigue and malaise over the 
last week. For 2-3 days prior to admission she had had atypical 
angina. She describes episodes of intermittent shortness of 
breath with associated left sided chest pain that would 
frequently happen at rest. She describes left sided chest pain 
as sharp, lasting ""minutes"", localized over left shoulder and 
radiating to left upper arm, pain would change with change in 
arm position. Patient was admitted to [**Hospital 51**] hospital and 
treated with supportive therapy/antiemetrics. She was given SL 
NTG with resolution of her symptoms. She ruled out MI with three 
sets of enzymes. On [**2751-2-19**] she underwent p-MIBI which showed 
inferior ischemia/no infarct. The patient was then cathed at the 
OSH and cath revealed 2 vessel disease: 85-90% proximal LAD and 
70% RCA stenosis, dampening LMA; normal left heart hemodynamics. 
Per Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **], it was decided to tx the patient here for further 
treatment.

Patient had stents to LAD placed on [**2751-2-22**]. During the 
procedure she developed CP/nausea with 2mm ST elevations in 
inferior leads, became bradycardic and was given atropine and 
dopamine. Flow in LAD/LCX normal/no dissection. RCA was stented 
with 2.5x18mm Cypher stent with no residual, TIMI 3 flow. 

Following the procedure she ruled in for myocardial infarction 
by enzymes but was symptomatically stable until early morning 
[**2751-2-24**] when she developed acute chest pain with EKG changes. In 
stent thrombosis was suspected and she was brought emergently to 
the cath lab. In the cath lab, she was found to have thrombus in 
her LAD.Export catheter was used to remove the clot when she 
started having EMD. Code was called and she was defibrllated and 
pressor were started. Stent was successfully deployed in the 
LAD. She went into VF and was again shocked. It was then decided 
that she might have had coronary spasm and showering of emboli. 
All pressors were stopped and 2000mcg diltiazem were given 
intracoronary and she return to NSR. Echocardiogram was done and 
ruled out pericardial tamponade but anterior wall AK. SHe 
recieved 6 unit of blood transfusion during the procedure. CT 
surgery evaluated patient in the catheterization lab but surgery 
was not deemed to be indicated at that time. Patient was 
transferred to the CCU.

 
Past Medical History:

depression, followed by a psychiatrist
diabetes x 5 years

Pertinent Results:
*******Cath [**2751-2-22**]
2 vessel disease. Ao 142/82/108
RCA mid 80%;  LMCA duffuse 40%  (FFR 0.95 suggestivng non-flow 
limiting stenosis); LAD diffuse 40%; LAD prox 90%, mid 80-90%.
Interventions: 1. Prox LAD lesion could not be crossed with 
Cyphher stents and two 2.5x12mm overlapping Taxus stensts were 
placed. This revealec mid LAD lesion that was underappreciated. 
Pt had CP/nausea, 2mm ST elevations in inferior leads, became 
bradycardic and was given atropine and dopamine. Flow in LAD/LCX 
normal/no dissection. 
2. RCA was stented with 2.5x18mm Cypher stent - no residual, 
TIMI 3. 3. Mid LAD 2.5x8 cm Cypher stent with no residuaa and 
TIMI 3.

EKG (post-cath at OSH): rate 80, sinus, nl axis, nl intervals, 
no ischemic ST or TW changes, Q in III, aVF.

infarct.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 52 yo patient of Dr.[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 70**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], with history of silent MI in 
[**2748**], diabetes mellitus, Hypertension, known 2 vessel CAD 
transferred from the OSH which was intervened. 
Patient has 2 vessel CAD s/p three stents to LAD and a stent to 
RCA complicated by MI. Patient was found to have in stent 
thrombosis of LAD stent [**2751-2-24**] which was intervened upon after 
resuscitation in the cath lab. She had polymorphic VT while in 
cath lab. 
She was subsequently transferred to the CCU with intraaortic 
balloon pump support and was on bivalirudin due to question of 
heparin induced thrombocytopenia. She was eventually stable 
enough to be weaned off balloon pump and dobutamine. She was 
continued on aspirin, lipitor. Her plavix was switched to 
ticlopidine since she developed in stent thrombosis while on 
plavix. Captopril was eventually started as her blood pressure 
tolerated it. Beta blocker was held as she has severe 
bronchospasm. She remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout CCU 
stay. On the day of her death, she developed respiratory 
distress and ventricular fibrillation. Resuscitation effort was 
attempted without success.

     INDICATION:  52-year-old woman status post cardiac catheterization, now with
     dropping hematocrit.
     
     COMPARISONS:  No comparisons are available.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  8-MDCT axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained
     without oral or IV contrast.
     
     There are atelectasis in the lung bases.  There are no pleural effusions or
     focal consolidations.  There is no evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma. There
     is stranding in the left inguinal region from prior catheterization. But,
     however, there is no evidence of a hematoma in the left groin.
     
     With the limitations of this noncontrast study, the liver, gallbladder,
     spleen, small and large bowel are unremarkable.  There is no free fluid or
     free air in the abdomen.  There are 2 areas of calcification overlying the
     pancreas that could most likely represent chronic pancreatitis rather than
     vascular calcifications.
     
     There is a hyperdense area in the upper pole of the right kidney that may
     represent retained contrast from prior cath in a calyceal diverticulum. There
     is a hyperdense area (2 mm) in the right kidney collecting system, which is
     could represent tiny nonobstructive versus contrast from prior cath. There is
     a 5 x 2 mm hyperdense area in a midpole calyx of the left kidney that could
     represent nonobstructive stone vs contrast.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT ORAL OR IV CONTRAST:  There is a Foley catheter
     within the urinary bladder.  There is stranding of the fat in the left groin
     from prior cardiac catheterization.  There is no evidence of groin hematoma.
     There is no evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.  With the limitations of
     this noncontrast study, the rectum and urinary bladder are unremarkable.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  The patient is status post posterior fusion of the lumbosacral
     spine.  Scout view demonstrated probable anterior-listhisis of L5 over S1.
     There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.

Respiratory Therapy
Pt received orally intubated on full mechanical support, weaned to PSV and succesfully extubated this PM to .40% cool neb via face tent.  Positive cuff leak prior to extubation, no stridor, but significant wheezing noted so albuterol/atrovent nebs started to good effect. Pt states she also takes these at home.  See resp flowsheet for specific vent data/changes.
