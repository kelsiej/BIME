Admission Date:  [**2918-7-6**]     Discharge Date:  [**2918-7-8**]

Date of Birth:   [**2827-2-13**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with
good baseline activities of daily living functions with a
history of coronary artery disease, with acute myocardial
infarction in [**2914**] status post successful primary
intervention with left ejection fraction of 30% after
myocardial infarction, who has done well since procedures
with only minor recurrence of chest pain and who also has a
history of colon cancer status post hemicolectomy.  Over the
last year, he has developed a prolonged PR interval, a right
bundle branch block, left anterior fascicular block that has
been noted on electrocardiograms.  Prior to admission, the
patient was able to walk regularly and be active, but on the
day of admission at around noon, the patient had severe
lightheadedness and dizziness while walking.

He denied chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting
or diaphoresis at that time.  The patient had significant
symptoms while standing, walking and even when trying to sit
upright; after the initial episode of dizziness, however, he
was asymptomatic while resting in bed in a prone position.  A
bystander at the scene of the initial episode was savvy
enough to check a pulse which was 37 at the time of onset of
symptoms.  In the Emergency Room, the patient had a pulse
ranging from 32 to 34 with a blood pressure in the 110 to 120
over 40 to 50 range without symptoms.  He had no chest pain,
no shortness of breath, and no diaphoresis.

The patient denies recent medication changes.  He has had no
recent fevers, chills, sweats, cough, prior episodes of
dizziness, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, nausea,
vomiting or abdominal pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Colon cancer.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Bullous pemphigus.
6.  Glaucoma.
7.  Cataracts.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His physical examination on admission
was vital signs of blood pressure 113/48; heart rate 32 to
34; O2 saturation 99% on room air; respiratory rate 14.
General examination was an elderly male that was alert and
oriented times three in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Pupils
were equal, round and reactive to light with accommodation.
His mucous membranes were moist.  Oropharynx was clear.  His
cranial nerves II through XII were intact.  Neck:  No venous
pulsation, no thyromegaly.  Cardiovascular examination showed
bradycardia, irregular rhythm, normal S1 and S2 but no
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Pulmonary examination clear to
auscultation bilaterally; no wheezes.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender; he had active bowel sounds.  Extremities cool to
touch; no cyanosis, no edema, one plus radial pulse, one plus
posterior tibial pulse and one plus dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.

LABORATORY:  On admission, white blood cell count 9.0,
hemoglobin 14.0, hematocrit 14.1, neutrophils 74%,
lymphocytes 18%, monocytes 6% and eosinophils 1%.  His
platelet count was 163.  PT was 12.4, INR 1.1, PTT 34.3.  His
sodium 140, potassium 4.8, chloride 105, bicarbonate 24, BUN
53, creatinine 1.7.  CK was 43, CK MB was 1.  His troponin
was less than 0.3 and CPK was, as I said, 43.

His chest x-ray impression was:  Much improved appearance
compared to prior examination on [**2916-10-28**], without
congestive heart failure or pneumonia.

EKG showed undifferentiated second degree heart block with
2:1 conduction pattern and occasional runs of second degree
Type I Wenckebach block.  EKG also showed profound
bradycardia.  There was no evidence of ST elevation or other
signs of ischemia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Bradycardia:  On the evening of admission, a central
venous catheterization Cordis, was placed and transvenous
pacing was induced at a rate of 80.  This pacing was done for
six to eight hours prior to the patient being sent to the
Electrophysiology Laboratory where he had a permanent pacer
placed on [**7-7**] without complications.  The patient's
pacemaker was interrogated both after the procedure and the
day following procedure, which showed appropriate pacing.

The patient received two days of Kefzol and was sent home
with one day of p.o. Keflex for post-procedure antibiotic
prophylaxis.  The patient had an appropriate paced rhythm in
the range of 60 to 80 throughout the remainder of his
hospitalization.  He was hemodynamically stable throughout
the rest of his hospitalization.  He had no new complaints.

2.  Activity:  The patient's activity is to be monitored for
six to eight weeks, avoiding raising his left arm above his
shoulder due to replacement from the pacemaker.  The patient
will have a visiting nurse which was arranged by the Care
Coordinator, to visit on a daily basis, to help him with his
daily functions in light of his arm restrictions.

3.  Renal:  The patient's creatinine elevated to 1.7 on the
day of admission, which was thought to be from low p.o.
intake and low ejection fraction secondary to bradycardia.
Intravenous hydration followed by p.o. hydration, led to
normalization of the patient's creatinine to 1.1.  It was
later learned that the patient had a baseline slightly
inhibited renal function which was evident in his hospital
course.

4.  Endocrine:  The patient was maintained on his maintenance
dose of Prednisone at 5 mg p.o. for his diagnosis of bullous
pemphigus.  It was not thought that he needed any stress dose
steroids as the 5 mg dose was not suppressing his pituitary
access.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   Good.

DISPOSITION:   The patient was discharged home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Tri-fascicular heart block.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Plavix 75 mg q. day.
2.  Cozaar 25 mg q. day.
3.  Aspirin 325 mg q. day.
4.  Zantac 150 mg twice a day.
5.  Latanoprost 0.005%, place one drop in right eye at bed
time.
6.  Metoprolol 25 q. day.
7.  Potassium 20 mg q. day.
8.  Sertraline 50 mg q. day.
9.  Lipitor 10 mg q. day.
10. Prednisone 5 mg q. day.
11. Keflex 500 mg q. eight hours times four doses.

     COMPARISONS: [**2918-7-6**].
     
     SINGLE VIEW CHEST:  Evaluation is limited as the X-ray beam is centered too
     high on this patient. A right internal jugular catheter is visualized as it
     courses through the right atrium and then into the right ventricle but the
     transvenous pacing device is not included on the film.  A repeat radiograph
     could be considered for further assessment.  No focal consolidations are
     identified.  There is no evidence for pneumothorax. The costophrenic angles
     are cut off from this film.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Incomplete assessment of transvenous pacing device. No evidence for
     pneumothorax. A repeat chest radiograph could be considered for further
     evaluation.

TSICU ADMIT NOTE:

PLEASE SEE FHP FOR PMH/ADMIT DETAILS

Pt is a [**Age over 90 1956**]y/o male with PMH significant for CAD, pacer placement, CHF, asthma, and emphysema. He presented to [**Hospital1 22**] ER [**1-17**] with weakness lasting three weeks. Admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 3**] 7 and shortly developed chest heaviness relieved by nitro, hypotension nausea, difficulty breathing and EKG changes with ST elevation. CXR showed ?right middle lobe pneumonia. ?sepsis/ARDS picture.  He was then transfered to TSICU for intubation. Dopamine gtt started and increased to 20mcgs, Levophed gtt started at 0.5mcgs. Swan placed. Continues with hypotension and now bradycardia, family contacted re: code status and now awaiting arrival.

Review of Systems:

NEURO-Alert and oriented on admission, UTA now due to ETT. Pt opens eyes, MAE's spontaneously and following commands. PERRLA. Anxious due to stimulation. Versed 0.5mg and Fentanyl 50mcgs given since admission to unit. 

CV-AV paced rate previously 80-90 now 50. RIght arterial line placed. Hypotensive SBP 80-40's/40-20's. Dopamine gtt at 20mcgs, LEvophed gtt at 0.5mcgs. Swan placed, unable to wedge. CXR performed for placement. PIV x2 to left FA. 

RESP-Intubated with 7.5ETT 21LL. See carevue for vent details. Lung sounds coarse with crackles. Lasix 40mg given IV. Suctioned for off white thick secretions. CXR showed right middle lobe pneumonia. 

GI-Abdomen soft, nontender. Hypoactive BS. NPO

GU-Indwelling foley catheter placed on admission to unit. Clear yellow uop with minimal output. 

ID-Vanco and Zosyn for infiltrate on CXR. 

SOCIAL-Pt has daughter [**Name (NI) 243**] who is spokesperson. Family on route to hospital now to discuss plan of care. Pt was DNR however family wanted intubation and pressors. Now given maxed point on pressors ?code status. 

PLAN-Family meeting re:code status
    -Keep pressors at current rate.
    -Monitor for comfort, anxiety, medicate as needed.
    -Monitor fluid status, need for Lasix.
    -Antibiotics as ordered.
