Admission Date:  [**3484-8-29**]     Discharge Date:  [**3484-9-1**]

Date of Birth:   [**3409-1-11**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU/MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75 year-old male with
a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease.  He is status
post a silent myocardial infarction and also has a history of
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (he has 100 pack year
of smoking tobacco and is still smoking).  He also has a
history of hypercholesterolemia, hypertension.  He also has a
history of lower gastrointestinal bleed and anemia.  The
patient presented to the [**Hospital 1922**] Hospital on [**3484-8-29**]
with shortness of breath and diaphoresis.  He was found to
have an ST segment elevation myocardial infarction and
congestive heart failure at the [**Hospital1 1922**] and was transferred
to the [**Hospital1 75**] for cardiac
catheterization.  In the catheterization laboratory revealed
three vessel disease, 100% left anterior descending coronary
artery and right coronary artery, short left main carotid
artery without any lesions, and an 80% left circumflex artery
and an 80% OMI.  There were no interventions done during the
catheterization.  Many collaterals were noted at the time.
CT Surgery was consulted in the catheterization laboratory
during the procedure for a potential coronary artery bypass
graft.  The patient's catheterization was uncomplicated and
he was scheduled to undergo coronary artery bypass graft on
Monday [**3484-9-1**].

In preparation preoperatively he had an echocardiogram, which
showed an ejection fraction of 15 to 20% and apical inferior
and basal akinesis.  This was in contrast to his
transthoracic echocardiogram study in [**3483-4-27**] that
showed an ejection fraction of 50%, mild hypokinesis of the
inferobasal wall.  The patient was also noted post
catheterization to have a mild groin hematoma.  Further
preoperative evaluation included diuresis with Lasix as well
as carotid doppler ultrasound studies, which demonstrated 60%
occlusion in the left carotid artery and essentially clean
right carotid artery.  The patient was stable throughout his
course of his hospitalization until the morning of [**3484-9-1**] when the house staff was called for an expanding
hematoma of the right groin.  Initially his vital signs were
stable.  Repeat hematocrit showed that this was stable since
the prior study four hours earlier.

Over the next couple of minutes the patient's blood pressure
was noticed to drop from the systolic high 110s to 80/40.
The patient was given wide open fluids and a code was called
and eventually Dopamine was started.  The patient's blood
pressure responded to this intervention.  During the code a
unit of packed red blood cells was ordered and begun to
transfuse.  Shortly after this time the patient was noted to
seize briefly and then go into ventricular fibrillation
rhythm.  The patient was shocked repeatedly for ventricular
fibrillation.  He subsequently went in and out of asystole
alternating with ventricular fibrillation.  The patient had
over the course of the one hour code received multiple
shocks, calcium carbonate, bicarbonate, magnesium, amiodarone
as well as atropine.  None of these measures were sufficient
to sustain life and the patient expired at approximately 1:05
p.m. on [**3484-9-1**].  The family, which included his two
sisters [**Name (NI) **] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6786**] [**Known patient lastname 11147**] were notified in a timely
fashion and they refused the postmortem examination.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      75 year old man s/p MI, awaiting CABG. this is a pre-ep carotid study.          
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      eval for stenosis

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Patient s/p left carotid endarterectomy with known stenosis.
     Perform follow up evaluation patient is preop for heart surgery.
     
     FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of both carotid arteries. ___ plaque
     was identified on the right.
     
     On the right, peak systolic velocities are 174, 68, 100 in the ICA, CCA, ECA
     respectively. ICA to CCA ratio is 2.6. This is consistent with a 60-69%
     stenosis.
     
     On the left, peak systolic velocities are 65, 56, 113 in the ICA, CCA, ECA
     respectively. ICA to CCA ratio is 1.16. This is consistent with no stenosis.
     
     There is antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.
     
     IMPRESSION: Significant right sided plaque with a 60-69% carotid stenosis. On
     the left, there is no evidence of stenosis s/p endarterectomy.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     PORTABLE CHEST:
     
     INDICATION: Myocardial infarction. Evaluate for congestive heart failure.
     
     The examination is limited due to exclusion of a portion of the right lung
     base laterally from the study.
     
     The heart is upper limits of normal in size for technique. The aorta is
     tortuous the pulmonary vascularity appears engorged and indistinct. There is
     bilateral perihilar haziness. Note is made of bilateral calcified pleural
     plaques along the diaphragmatic surfaces. A few additional plaques are seen in
     the left upper and mid hemithorax as well. No pleural effusion is evident but
     the right costophrenic angle has been excluded and cannot be assessed.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) Congestive heart failure pattern with vascular engorgement and
     perihilar haziness.
     
     2) Calcified pleural plaques bilaterally, in keeping with prior asbestos
     exposure.
     
     3) Incomplete imaging of the chest with exclusion of the lateral portion of
     part of the right lung. Repeat radiograph to include this region is suggested.
