Admission Date:  [**2837-7-29**]     Discharge Date:  [**2837-8-11**]

Date of Birth:   [**2776-1-17**]     Sex:  M

Service:  Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61-year-old male with
mucinous adenocarcinoma arising from appendix with extensive
carcinomatosis and tumor involving the small bowel near the
SMA diagnosed by exploratory laparotomy in [**2836-5-8**].  He
underwent a palliative bypass procedure at that time.  He was
readmitted on [**7-29**] with a 2-week history of increasing
abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, and a temperature of 104.8
degrees with peritoneal signs on abdominal examination.  CT
scan revealed worsening of small bowel distention, small
bowel wall thickening, increased ascites, and extra luminous
air, and a small collection in the right lower quadrant.
This collection did not appear amenable to drainage.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Thus, on [**2837-7-30**], in the early a.m.
the patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy and a small
bowel resection.  Preoperative diagnosis was perforated
viscous.  Postoperative diagnosis was small bowel
perforation.  The surgeon of record was Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
Findings intraoperatively included a closed-loop obstruction,
bypass small bowel with perforation in the right upper
quadrant.  The patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive
Care Unit for postoperative care.  He was intubated as of
postoperative day one.  Due to the perforated viscous, the
patient was kept on Kefzol and Flagyl antibiotics
postoperatively.  The patient was extubated on [**7-31**].  He
did remain n.p.o. with nasogastric tube suction at this time
and remained on Kefzol and Flagyl.  He required transfusion
of 1 unit of packed red blood cells on [**8-1**] for a
hematocrit of 27.8.

The patient was transferred to the floor on [**8-2**].  His
nasogastric tube was discontinued.  The patient was to be
transferred to the floor, but he still had some hypotension
issues and was actually kept until [**8-3**].  Enalapril and
Lopressor were able to keep his blood pressure under control,
and he was transferred to the floor on [**8-3**].

On [**8-4**], the patient continued to do well, and his
Kefzol and Flagyl were discontinued.  The Foley catheter was
discontinued on [**8-5**].  The patient was tolerating clears
as of [**8-5**].  On [**8-6**], on the patient's abdominal
examination, there was noted to be an increase in
serosanguineous drainage from the site of the incision, and
the patient had a temperature of 101.2 degrees.  A CT scan on
[**8-6**] revealed a right-sided intra-abdominal fluid
collection.  This collection was drained by Interventional
Radiology on [**8-7**] with a #12 French pigtail placed in
the right lower quadrant; 70 cc of purulent material were
drained at this time.  At the time of discharge, the culture
from this fluid had grown out no anaerobes, no enterococcus,
two colonies of gram-negative rods in moderate quantity.  A
third gram-negative rod species, sparse, gram-positive
bacteria, also streptococcus and gram-positive rods in broth
only.

The patient did very well after this drain was put in.  The
patient was also put on levofloxacin and Flagyl as of
[**8-7**].  The patient was advanced to a regular diet as of
[**2837-8-9**].

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  As of [**2837-8-11**], the patient
was stable for discharge to home with Visiting Nurse
Association care.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  He was to be discharged on
Avandia 4 mg p.o. q.d., levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d.,
Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  He was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  The
patient will also receive Visiting Nurse Association for
drain care at home, and also b.i.d. dry sterile dressing
changes to his wound.

     CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS [**2837-7-29**].
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  61 year old man with appendiceal cancer.  Now with
     abdominal pain x 2 weeks and elevated temperature.  Evaluate for obstruction,
     abscess, cancer recurrence.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung bases through the pubic symphysis following the administration of 150 cc
     of Optiray contrast IV.  Optiray contrast was administered in light of the
     patient's nausea.  In addition, noncontrast imaging through the liver was
     performed.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Comparison is made to the next prior CT study of [**2837-6-8**].
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  No nodules, opacities or
     pleural effusions are present at the lung bases.  There is an NG tube passing
     through the esophagus into the upper stomach.  The liver is within normal
     limits without focal hepatic lesions.  There is mild prominence of the
     intrahepatic biliary ducts, stable since the prior study.  No gallbladder is
     identified, presumably status post cholecystectomy.  The adrenal glands are
     unremarkable.  There are calcifications present within the head of the
     pancreas, unchanged since the prior exam and likely related to prior chronic
     pancreatitis.  The patient is status post splenectomy.  Both right and left
     kidneys demonstrate prompt symmetric excretion of contrast without
     hydronephrosis, renal masses or stones.  Again identified is dilatation of the
     small bowel with fecalization of the small bowel contents.  The overall
     caliber of the small bowel is stable if not slightly decreased in prominence
     since the prior exam.  There has been interval development of increasing bowel
     wall thickness.  This thickening is diffusely involving the small bowel. There
     is a linear collection of gas along the margin of the small bowel wall (see
     image 35 of series 3).  This gas appears to be within the lumen of the small
     bowel rather than pneumatosis.  There has been interval worsening of the
     intra-abdominal free fluid.  Within the right paracolic gutter and extending
     into the pelvis, there is a loculated fluid collection which contains several
     small pockets of air. This appears to represent a loculated fluid collection
     with extraluminal air. This appearance is concerning for infection of the
     intra- abdominal fluid versus perforation of the bowel.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The rectum and sigmoid colon are
     unremarkable as are the prostate gland, seminal vesicles and urinary bladder.
                                                                 (Over)

     The osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Interval increase in loculated free fluid within the abdomen.  Pockets of
     air appear to be located within this loculated fluid raising the suspicion for
     infection of the intra-abdominal fluid versus bowel perforation. Small bowel
     ischemia should be considered.
     2.  No significant change in dilatation of the small bowel.
     3.  Interval increase in diffuse bowel wall thickening.  No definite evidence
     for pneumatosis.
     
     The results were conveyed to the housestaff on the evening of this study.

     TECHNIQUE:  CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast.  Optiray was used for
     general debilitation.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The lung bases reveal small pleural effusions
     and associated atelectasis.
     
     There is internal development of a wedge-shaped area of increased enhancement
     in the right hepatic lobe, most likely representing perfusion abnormality. The
     patient is status post cholecystectomy and splenectomy.  The adrenal glands
     and kidneys appear unremarkable.  There is diffuse ascites tracking between
     bowel loops and along the mesentery.  Multiple small pockets of air are noted
     in the ascites, which could represent postoperative changes.  The ascites
     demonstrates an enhancing rim, superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
     There are segments of thickened bowel loops, especially in the right lower
     quadrant, of no significant interval change since the prior study, and could
     be caused by a low protein state.  There is also nodularity of the bowel
     walls, consistent with peritoneal implants.  The anterior midline abdominal
     wall wound is demonstrated.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The urinary bladder appears unremarkable.  The
     left ureter appears unremarkable.  The right ureter appears distended and
     unopd with contrast, indicative of obstruction.  Again, pelvic nodularity is
     present, indicative of peritoneal implants.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Status post small bowel resection six days ago, with wound
     drainage and suppuration, evaluate for fluid collection or abscess.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT abdomen, [**2837-7-29**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast.  Optiray was used for
     general debilitation.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The lung bases reveal small pleural effusions
     and associated atelectasis.
     
     There is internal development of a wedge-shaped area of increased enhancement
     in the right hepatic lobe, most likely representing perfusion abnormality. The
     patient is status post cholecystectomy and splenectomy.  The adrenal glands
     and kidneys appear unremarkable.  There is diffuse ascites tracking between
     bowel loops and along the mesentery.  Multiple small pockets of air are noted
     in the ascites, which could represent postoperative changes.  The ascites
     demonstrates an enhancing rim, superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
     There are segments of thickened bowel loops, especially in the right lower
     quadrant, of no significant interval change since the prior study, and could
     be caused by a low protein state.  There is also nodularity of the bowel
     walls, consistent with peritoneal implants.  The anterior midline abdominal
     wall wound is demonstrated.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The urinary bladder appears unremarkable.  The
     left ureter appears unremarkable.  The right ureter appears distended and
     unopd with contrast, indicative of obstruction.  Again, pelvic nodularity is
     present, indicative of peritoneal implants.

     INDICATION:  Colon and appendix cancer.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous helical images were obtained from the thoracic inlet to
     the pubic symphysis after the administration of 150 cc of IV Optiray.  Optiray
     was used per the patient's history of allergies.  Additionally, images through
     the liver were obtained prior to administration of IV contrast.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT abdomen dated [**2837-8-6**].
     
     CT THORAX WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is no significant axillary, hilar, or
     mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are
     unremarkable.  There are no pleural effusions.
     
     Evaluation of the lungs reveals diffuse centrilobular emphysema.  There are no
     parenchymal nodules or areas of consolidation.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The wedge shaped heterogeneous area
     of protusion abnormality in the right hepatic lobe is not significantly
     changed.  The patient is S/P cholecystectomy and splenectomy.  There has been
     distal pancreatectomy as well.  The head of the pancreas is unremarkable.  The
     adrenal glands are normal.  The kidneys enhance symmetrically and are without
     hydronephrosis or stones.  There is bowel wall edema involving much of the
     small bowel as well as minimal dilatation of a few of the small bowel loops.
     There is a moderate amount of ascites.  There has been resolution of air that
     had previously been seen within the ascites.  The degree of bowel thickening
     and dilatation as well as ascites is not significantly changed in the
     interval.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The prostate is enlarged and heterogeneous but
     not significantly changed.  It indents upon the undersurface of the otherwise
     normal bladder.  The left ureter is normal.  The right ureter is not
     visualized but approximately the right ureter is within normal limits.  Again,
     there is diffuse bowel thickening and ascites.  There is the suggestion of
     peritoneal nodularity.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate no significant abnormality.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Diffuse bowel wall thickening and ascites, not significantly
     changed.  This could be secondary to low albumin state.

     the liver were obtained prior to administration of IV contrast.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT abdomen dated [**2837-8-6**].
     
     CT THORAX WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is no significant axillary, hilar, or
     mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are
     unremarkable.  There are no pleural effusions.
     
     Evaluation of the lungs reveals diffuse centrilobular emphysema.  There are no
     parenchymal nodules or areas of consolidation.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The wedge shaped heterogeneous area
     of protusion abnormality in the right hepatic lobe is not significantly
     changed.  The patient is S/P cholecystectomy and splenectomy.  There has been
     distal pancreatectomy as well.  The head of the pancreas is unremarkable.  The
     adrenal glands are normal.  The kidneys enhance symmetrically and are without
     hydronephrosis or stones.  There is bowel wall edema involving much of the
     small bowel as well as minimal dilatation of a few of the small bowel loops.
     There is a moderate amount of ascites.  There has been resolution of air that
     had previously been seen within the ascites.  The degree of bowel thickening
     and dilatation as well as ascites is not significantly changed in the
     interval.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The prostate is enlarged and heterogeneous but
     not significantly changed.  It indents upon the undersurface of the otherwise
     normal bladder.  The left ureter is normal.  The right ureter is not
     visualized but approximately the right ureter is within normal limits.  Again,
     there is diffuse bowel thickening and ascites.  There is the suggestion of
     peritoneal nodularity.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate no significant abnormality.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 62yr old male with metastatic appendiceal cancer, nausea and
     abdominal pain.
     
     COMPARISON: Multiple previous studies including [**2837-7-29**] and [**2836-4-24**] as well as
     CT scans of [**2838-1-7**] and [**2837-7-29**].
     
     ABDOMEN: Supine and upright views of the abdomen demonstrate multiple mildly
     dilated, gas filled loops of small bowel with air fluid levels.  Gas and stool
     are seen throughout the large bowel into the rectum.  The stomach is distended
     with gas.  Surgical clips are seen overlying the L1-2 interspace.  There is no
     free air beneath the diaphragm.  The lung bases are clear.
     
     IMPRESSION: Multiple mildly dilated small bowel loops with air fluid levels
     could indicate early/partial small bowel obstruction.  This appearance is
     similar to multiple previous examinations dating back to [**2836-4-7**].

     TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the abdomen were obtained after the administration
     of 150 cc of Optiray per history of allergies.
     
     Multiplanar reconstructions were performed.
     
     Comparison with prior CT from [**2838-1-7**].
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is an NG tube with the tip in the
     stomach.  The lung bases are clear.  There is no pericardial or pleural fluid.
     There is heterogeneous enhancement of the liver consistent with a perfusion
     abnormality.  This is probably related to fatty liver infiltration or edema.
     No definite masses are identified. The patient is status post cholecystectomy,
     cholecystectomy and distal pancreatectomy.  The kidneys are normal without
     evidence of focal lesions, there is no hydronephrosis.  The adrenal glands are
     unremarkable.  Again seen is a moderate amount of ascites, not significantly
     changed compared to prior exam.
     
     The stomach is distended, a small amount of contrast is seen in the small
     bowel.  Loops of small bowel are massively distended, the largest ones measure
     up to 6.9 cm, previously the largest loops of small bowel measured 5.4 cm.
     There is fecalization of material in the small bowel.  There is a large amount
     of stool within the sigmoid and rectum, the transverse and right colon appear
     non- dilated and contain a small amount of stool. There is an enhancing
     heterogeneous mass in the right lower quadrant.  Also noted are enhancing
     peritoneal masses consistent with known carcinomatosis. No free air is
     identified.  The major aortic branches are patent.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The prostate is enlarged, there is a Foley
     catheter within the bladder.  There are extensive degenerative changes
     throughout the spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Interval worsening of chronic partial small bowel obstruction.  
     2) Stable peritoneal carcinomatosis and ascites.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Metastatic appendiceal cancer, peritoneal carcinomatosis and
     recurrent SBO.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the abdomen were obtained after the administration
     of 150 cc of Optiray per history of allergies.
     
     Multiplanar reconstructions were performed.
     
     Comparison with prior CT from [**2838-1-7**].
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is an NG tube with the tip in the
     stomach.  The lung bases are clear.  There is no pericardial or pleural fluid.
     There is heterogeneous enhancement of the liver consistent with a perfusion
     abnormality.  This is probably related to fatty liver infiltration or edema.
     No definite masses are identified. The patient is status post cholecystectomy,
     cholecystectomy and distal pancreatectomy.  The kidneys are normal without
     evidence of focal lesions, there is no hydronephrosis.  The adrenal glands are
     unremarkable.  Again seen is a moderate amount of ascites, not significantly
     changed compared to prior exam.
     
     The stomach is distended, a small amount of contrast is seen in the small
     bowel.  Loops of small bowel are massively distended, the largest ones measure
     up to 6.9 cm, previously the largest loops of small bowel measured 5.4 cm.
     There is fecalization of material in the small bowel.  There is a large amount
     of stool within the sigmoid and rectum, the transverse and right colon appear
     non- dilated and contain a small amount of stool. There is an enhancing
     heterogeneous mass in the right lower quadrant.  Also noted are enhancing
     peritoneal masses consistent with known carcinomatosis. No free air is
     identified.  The major aortic branches are patent.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The prostate is enlarged, there is a Foley
     catheter within the bladder.  There are extensive degenerative changes
     throughout the spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Interval worsening of chronic partial small bowel obstruction.  
     2) Stable peritoneal carcinomatosis and ascites.
     3) Perfusion abnormality in the liver probably related to fatty liver
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION:  62 year old male with metastatic appendiceal carcinoma,
     peritoneal carcinomatosis, and partial small bowel obstruction.  Please place
     gastrostomy tube for symptomatic decompression.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **], [**Name5 (PTitle) 2366**] [**Doctor Last Name 2367**], and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 513**].  Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) **], Staff Radiologist, was present throughout the procedure.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:  30 ml of Conray at 60%; 50 mcg fentanyl and .5 mg
     Versed in divided doses under continued hemodynamic monitoring for conscious
     sedation.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was explained to the patient and
     informed consent obtained.  The stomach was insufflated with air using the
     pre-existing nasogastric tube, and two T-fasteners were placed under
     fluoroscopic guidance, securing the body of the stomach to the anterior
     abdominal wall.  Following local anesthetic infiltration, a skin incision was
     made between the two T-fasteners, and a 19-gauge single-wall needle was
     advanced while aspirating until the body of the stomach was encountered.  A
     small amount of contrast material was then injected, documenting a gastric
     location.  A 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 223**] wire was then placed through the needle and into
     the body and fundus of the stomach.  The needle was then removed and exchanged
     for a 4-French Kumpe catheter.  The wire was then pulled back, and the
     catheter and wire were manipulated into the pyloric region initially, and
     eventually through the duodenum and beyond the ligament of Treitz in the
     jejunum.  The wire was removed, and a small amount of contrast material was
     injected through the catheter, documenting a jejunal location.  The wire was
     then reinserted through the catheter, and the catheter removed.  The tract was
     dilated up to 12 French, and a 12-French Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 8934**] gastrostomy catheter
     was advance with the metal stylet into the gastric antrum.  The stylet and
     wire were subsequently removed, the pigtail portion of the gastrostomy
     catheter was formed in the distal body/antrum of the stomach.  The gastrostomy
     catheter was then secured to the patient's skin using 0-Prolene suture
     material and a Flexi-Track dressing.
     
     Contrast material was injected following placement of the gastrostomy tube,
     and contrast flowed freely through the gastric folds, into the fundus of the
                                                                 (Over)
