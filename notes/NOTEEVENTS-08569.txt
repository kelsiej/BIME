                                     FINAL REPORT
     CT OF THORAX, ABDOMEN AND PELVIS W/O CONTRAST, [**3438-7-31**]:
     
     INDICATION:  Bladder carcinoma and ileal conduit.  History of obstructed left
     kidney and nonfunctioning right kidney.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial scans were performed through the chest, abdomen and pelvis
     after administration of oral contrast.  The patient had had ionic contrast
     administered via the nephrostomy tube shortly prior to the CT exam.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     CT OF THORAX W/O CONTRAST:  Normal heart and mediastinal structures.  There is
     a sub-cm ill-defined nodular opacity at the left base which is too small to
     characterize.  We have no previous imaging for comparison.  The lungs are
     otherwise clear.
     
     CT OF ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST:  There is a nephrostomy tube in the left urinary
     system.  No hydronephrosis.  Contrast outlines the entire ureter to the level
     of the conduit.  The distal ureter is mildly dilated at the insertion into the
     conduit and there is residual contrast in its most distal portion.  I
     understand that this is the location of the obstruction at nephrostograms of
     [**7-31**] and [**6-2**].
     
     The small bowel loops in the region of the right iliac fossa are not dilated.
     There is no contrast within the stoma bag.
     
     The right kidney is small.  No hydronephrosis or hydroureter identified.
     
     No ascites or adenopathy.
     
     Normal liver, spleen, and pancreas.
     CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST
     Status post cystectomy.No adenopathy or ascites. There is marked
     circumferential  thickening of the rectal wall which measures 2.8cm in maximum
     dimension.Has the patient had radiotherapy to the pelvis?
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Mildly dilated distal left ureter with residual contrast.  Appearances are
     compatible with obstruction at the insertion to the conduit.  The findings
     correlate with the  nephrostomy tube  study.
                                                                 (Over)

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     History: S/P resection of bladder CA and ileal loop construction, status post
     radiation therapy.  Now obstruction of the left distal ureter.
     
     PROCEDURE:  This procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 6112**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 2109**] and [**Doctor Last Name 400**],
     with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 400**] being present and supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     30 min prior to the procedure he received 1 g Ceftriaxon IV. Local anesthesia
     was applied over the indwelling left- sided nephrostomy tube. An initial
     nephrostogram was performed.  It demonstrated the indwelling tube to be in
     good position.  The renal collecting system was decompressed. Urine could be
     followed distally to the anticipated level of the anastomosis with the ileum,
     however, urine would not transit, also with the patient in a semi- upright
     position.
     
     The decision was made to proceed with conversion to an internal/external
     ureteral stent.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 223**] guide wire was advanced through the tube, it was
     removed, however, the [**Last Name (un) 223**] guide wire became entangled with the spring-
     retention mechanism of the nephrostomy tube and the entire access had to be
     abandoned.  Based on the prior nephrostograms, there were only a few posterior
     calices, and therefore reinsufflation of the non-contrast-filled superior
     polar calix became necessary.  For this purposes, a 20-gauge needle was
     advanced under fluoroscopic guidance into the left renal collecting system.
     Apparently it traversed an artery, since there was some blood entering into
     the renal collecting system.  The superior posterior pole calix was
     identified.  It was entered with an 18-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 223**] guide
     wire, a 5-French angiographic sheath was advanced into the distal ureter.
     Subsequently, a 5-French Cobra glide catheter was used and advanced into the
     distal ureter.  Attempts were made to cross the stenosis, with a .035 angled
     Glidewire, a roadrunner guide wire and an extra stiff guide wire.  Also,
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     attempts to traverse the stenosis with a back end of a Glidewire and an
     Amplatz wire were not successful due to the firm nature.  Therefore, the
     decision was made to proceed with a sharp recanalization.
     
     For this purpose, it became necessary to catheterize the patient's ileal loop.
      A 5-French Cobra glide catheter was advanced with aid of a Glidewire into the
     loop.  It was used to perform a loopogram.  This loopogram demonstrated free
     reflux into the small right kidney, however, no filling of the distal ureter.
     Having aligned now the ileal loop and the distal ureter, exchange was made
     over an Amplatz guide wire for a sharp recanalization set, advanced through
     the nephrostomy tube access.  The 20-gauge puncture needle was advanced
     towards the ileum under triangulation.
     
     After three passes, it was then possible to exchange the system for a
     Glidewire which entered into the ileal loop.  It was advanced to the exit of
     the ileal loop, was grasped from the outside, and a through-and-through system
     was established.  This because necessary to provide the dilatation of the
     tight stenosis of the ureteral system.  The dilatation was performed by first
     advancing a long 8-French peel-away sheath into the left distal ureter and to
     advance a glide catheter through the ileal loop over the through-and-through
     system.  With this system, it was possible to pre-dilate.  With a junk wire,
     the determination was then made that a 35-cm-long drainage tube would be of
     sufficient length.  Then, an 8-French 35-cm Flexima catheter (""biliary
     drainage catheter"") was advanced from the ileal end.  A dilatation to 8 French
     was performed by advancing the entire through-and-through system from the
     ileal loop towards the renal exit.  To preserve access, a safety wire in form
     of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 223**] guide wire was placed into the proximal right ureter.  After
     advancement of the catheter into the renal pelvis from the ileal loop side,
     the through-and-through wire was removed from the renal end and a pigtail
     catheter was formed in the renal collecting system.  A final nephrostogram was
     performed.  It demonstrated the pigtail in good position.  There were some
     blood clots within the renal collecting system.  The safety wire was removed.
     The external end of the external/internal ureteral catheter was sutured to the
     external site of the ileostomy and let drain into the drainage bag.
     
     During the four-hour procedure, the patient received a total of 3 mg Versed,
     300 mcg fentanyl and 25 mg Demerol in divided doses and under continuous
     monitoring, for conscious sedation. His vital signs were monitored throughout
     and were stable. At the end, he developed some shivers, for which he had
     received the Demerol. He also received droperidol to combat nausea.
     
     He left for Recovery in stable condition.  There were no immediate
     complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Very firm occlusion of the distal left ureter.  Successful
     recanalization and dilatation up to 8 French with placement of an
                                                                 (Over)

     with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 400**] being present and supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     30 min prior to the procedure he received 1 g Ceftriaxon IV. Local anesthesia
     was applied over the indwelling left- sided nephrostomy tube. An initial
     nephrostogram was performed.  It demonstrated the indwelling tube to be in
     good position.  The renal collecting system was decompressed. Urine could be
     followed distally to the anticipated level of the anastomosis with the ileum,
     however, urine would not transit, also with the patient in a semi- upright
     position.
     
     The decision was made to proceed with conversion to an internal/external
     ureteral stent.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 223**] guide wire was advanced through the tube, it was
     removed, however, the [**Last Name (un) 223**] guide wire became entangled with the spring-
     retention mechanism of the nephrostomy tube and the entire access had to be
     abandoned.  Based on the prior nephrostograms, there were only a few posterior
     calices, and therefore reinsufflation of the non-contrast-filled superior
     polar calix became necessary.  For this purposes, a 20-gauge needle was
     advanced under fluoroscopic guidance into the left renal collecting system.
     Apparently it traversed an artery, since there was some blood entering into
     the renal collecting system.  The superior posterior pole calix was
     identified.  It was entered with an 18-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 223**] guide
     wire, a 5-French angiographic sheath was advanced into the distal ureter.
     Subsequently, a 5-French Cobra glide catheter was used and advanced into the
     distal ureter.  Attempts were made to cross the stenosis, with a .035 angled
     Glidewire, a roadrunner guide wire and an extra stiff guide wire.  Also,
                                                                 (Over)

     attempts to traverse the stenosis with a back end of a Glidewire and an
     Amplatz wire were not successful due to the firm nature.  Therefore, the
     decision was made to proceed with a sharp recanalization.
     
     For this purpose, it became necessary to catheterize the patient's ileal loop.
      A 5-French Cobra glide catheter was advanced with aid of a Glidewire into the
     loop.  It was used to perform a loopogram.  This loopogram demonstrated free
     reflux into the small right kidney, however, no filling of the distal ureter.
     Having aligned now the ileal loop and the distal ureter, exchange was made
     over an Amplatz guide wire for a sharp recanalization set, advanced through
     the nephrostomy tube access.  The 20-gauge puncture needle was advanced
     towards the ileum under triangulation.
     
     After three passes, it was then possible to exchange the system for a
     Glidewire which entered into the ileal loop.  It was advanced to the exit of
     the ileal loop, was grasped from the outside, and a through-and-through system
     was established.  This because necessary to provide the dilatation of the
     tight stenosis of the ureteral system.  The dilatation was performed by first
     advancing a long 8-French peel-away sheath into the left distal ureter and to
     advance a glide catheter through the ileal loop over the through-and-through
     system.  With this system, it was possible to pre-dilate.  With a junk wire,
     the determination was then made that a 35-cm-long drainage tube would be of
     sufficient length.  Then, an 8-French 35-cm Flexima catheter (""biliary
     drainage catheter"") was advanced from the ileal end.  A dilatation to 8 French
     was performed by advancing the entire through-and-through system from the
     ileal loop towards the renal exit.  To preserve access, a safety wire in form
     of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 223**] guide wire was placed into the proximal right ureter.  After
     advancement of the catheter into the renal pelvis from the ileal loop side,
     the through-and-through wire was removed from the renal end and a pigtail
     catheter was formed in the renal collecting system.  A final nephrostogram was
     performed.  It demonstrated the pigtail in good position.  There were some
     blood clots within the renal collecting system.  The safety wire was removed.
     The external end of the external/internal ureteral catheter was sutured to the
     external site of the ileostomy and let drain into the drainage bag.
     
     During the four-hour procedure, the patient received a total of 3 mg Versed,
     300 mcg fentanyl and 25 mg Demerol in divided doses and under continuous
     monitoring, for conscious sedation. His vital signs were monitored throughout
     and were stable. At the end, he developed some shivers, for which he had
     received the Demerol. He also received droperidol to combat nausea.
     
     He left for Recovery in stable condition.  There were no immediate
     complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Very firm occlusion of the distal left ureter.  Successful
     recanalization and dilatation up to 8 French with placement of an

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     History: S/P resection of bladder CA and ileal loop construction, status post
     radiation therapy.  Now obstruction of the left distal ureter.
     
     PROCEDURE:  This procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 6112**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 2109**] and [**Doctor Last Name 400**],
     with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 400**] being present and supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     30 min prior to the procedure he received 1 g Ceftriaxon IV. Local anesthesia
     was applied over the indwelling left- sided nephrostomy tube. An initial
     nephrostogram was performed.  It demonstrated the indwelling tube to be in
     good position.  The renal collecting system was decompressed. Urine could be
     followed distally to the anticipated level of the anastomosis with the ileum,
     however, urine would not transit, also with the patient in a semi- upright
     position.
     
     The decision was made to proceed with conversion to an internal/external
     ureteral stent.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 223**] guide wire was advanced through the tube, it was
     removed, however, the [**Last Name (un) 223**] guide wire became entangled with the spring-
     retention mechanism of the nephrostomy tube and the entire access had to be
     abandoned.  Based on the prior nephrostograms, there were only a few posterior
     calices, and therefore reinsufflation of the non-contrast-filled superior
     polar calix became necessary.  For this purposes, a 20-gauge needle was
     advanced under fluoroscopic guidance into the left renal collecting system.
     Apparently it traversed an artery, since there was some blood entering into
     the renal collecting system.  The superior posterior pole calix was
     identified.  It was entered with an 18-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 223**] guide
     wire, a 5-French angiographic sheath was advanced into the distal ureter.
     Subsequently, a 5-French Cobra glide catheter was used and advanced into the
     distal ureter.  Attempts were made to cross the stenosis, with a .035 angled
     Glidewire, a roadrunner guide wire and an extra stiff guide wire.  Also,
                                                                 (Over)

     attempts to traverse the stenosis with a back end of a Glidewire and an
     Amplatz wire were not successful due to the firm nature.  Therefore, the
     decision was made to proceed with a sharp recanalization.
     
     For this purpose, it became necessary to catheterize the patient's ileal loop.
      A 5-French Cobra glide catheter was advanced with aid of a Glidewire into the
     loop.  It was used to perform a loopogram.  This loopogram demonstrated free
     reflux into the small right kidney, however, no filling of the distal ureter.
     Having aligned now the ileal loop and the distal ureter, exchange was made
     over an Amplatz guide wire for a sharp recanalization set, advanced through
     the nephrostomy tube access.  The 20-gauge puncture needle was advanced
     towards the ileum under triangulation.
     
     After three passes, it was then possible to exchange the system for a
     Glidewire which entered into the ileal loop.  It was advanced to the exit of
     the ileal loop, was grasped from the outside, and a through-and-through system
     was established.  This because necessary to provide the dilatation of the
     tight stenosis of the ureteral system.  The dilatation was performed by first
     advancing a long 8-French peel-away sheath into the left distal ureter and to
     advance a glide catheter through the ileal loop over the through-and-through
     system.  With this system, it was possible to pre-dilate.  With a junk wire,
     the determination was then made that a 35-cm-long drainage tube would be of
     sufficient length.  Then, an 8-French 35-cm Flexima catheter (""biliary
     drainage catheter"") was advanced from the ileal end.  A dilatation to 8 French
     was performed by advancing the entire through-and-through system from the
     ileal loop towards the renal exit.  To preserve access, a safety wire in form
     of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 223**] guide wire was placed into the proximal right ureter.  After
     advancement of the catheter into the renal pelvis from the ileal loop side,
     the through-and-through wire was removed from the renal end and a pigtail
     catheter was formed in the renal collecting system.  A final nephrostogram was
     performed.  It demonstrated the pigtail in good position.  There were some
     blood clots within the renal collecting system.  The safety wire was removed.
     The external end of the external/internal ureteral catheter was sutured to the
     external site of the ileostomy and let drain into the drainage bag.
     
     During the four-hour procedure, the patient received a total of 3 mg Versed,
     300 mcg fentanyl and 25 mg Demerol in divided doses and under continuous
     monitoring, for conscious sedation. His vital signs were monitored throughout
     and were stable. At the end, he developed some shivers, for which he had
     received the Demerol. He also received droperidol to combat nausea.
     
     He left for Recovery in stable condition.  There were no immediate
     complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Very firm occlusion of the distal left ureter.  Successful
     recanalization and dilatation up to 8 French with placement of an
                                                                 (Over)

     drainage catheter"") was advanced from the ileal end.  A dilatation to 8 French
     was performed by advancing the entire through-and-through system from the
     ileal loop towards the renal exit.  To preserve access, a safety wire in form
     of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 223**] guide wire was placed into the proximal right ureter.  After
     advancement of the catheter into the renal pelvis from the ileal loop side,
     the through-and-through wire was removed from the renal end and a pigtail
     catheter was formed in the renal collecting system.  A final nephrostogram was
     performed.  It demonstrated the pigtail in good position.  There were some
     blood clots within the renal collecting system.  The safety wire was removed.
     The external end of the external/internal ureteral catheter was sutured to the
     external site of the ileostomy and let drain into the drainage bag.
     
     During the four-hour procedure, the patient received a total of 3 mg Versed,
     300 mcg fentanyl and 25 mg Demerol in divided doses and under continuous
     monitoring, for conscious sedation. His vital signs were monitored throughout
     and were stable. At the end, he developed some shivers, for which he had
     received the Demerol. He also received droperidol to combat nausea.
     
     He left for Recovery in stable condition.  There were no immediate
     complications.

     History: S/P resection of bladder CA and ileal loop construction, status post
     radiation therapy.  Now obstruction of the left distal ureter.
     
     PROCEDURE:  This procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 6112**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 2109**] and [**Doctor Last Name 400**],
     with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 400**] being present and supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     30 min prior to the procedure he received 1 g Ceftriaxon IV. Local anesthesia
     was applied over the indwelling left- sided nephrostomy tube. An initial
     nephrostogram was performed.  It demonstrated the indwelling tube to be in
     good position.  The renal collecting system was decompressed. Urine could be
     followed distally to the anticipated level of the anastomosis with the ileum,
     however, urine would not transit, also with the patient in a semi- upright
     position.
     
     The decision was made to proceed with conversion to an internal/external
     ureteral stent.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 223**] guide wire was advanced through the tube, it was
     removed, however, the [**Last Name (un) 223**] guide wire became entangled with the spring-
     retention mechanism of the nephrostomy tube and the entire access had to be
     abandoned.  Based on the prior nephrostograms, there were only a few posterior
     calices, and therefore reinsufflation of the non-contrast-filled superior
     polar calix became necessary.  For this purposes, a 20-gauge needle was
     advanced under fluoroscopic guidance into the left renal collecting system.
     Apparently it traversed an artery, since there was some blood entering into
     the renal collecting system.  The superior posterior pole calix was
     identified.  It was entered with an 18-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 223**] guide
     wire, a 5-French angiographic sheath was advanced into the distal ureter.
     Subsequently, a 5-French Cobra glide catheter was used and advanced into the
     distal ureter.  Attempts were made to cross the stenosis, with a .035 angled
     Glidewire, a roadrunner guide wire and an extra stiff guide wire.  Also,
                                                                 (Over)

     attempts to traverse the stenosis with a back end of a Glidewire and an
     Amplatz wire were not successful due to the firm nature.  Therefore, the
     decision was made to proceed with a sharp recanalization.
     
     For this purpose, it became necessary to catheterize the patient's ileal loop.
      A 5-French Cobra glide catheter was advanced with aid of a Glidewire into the
     loop.  It was used to perform a loopogram.  This loopogram demonstrated free
     reflux into the small right kidney, however, no filling of the distal ureter.
     Having aligned now the ileal loop and the distal ureter, exchange was made
     over an Amplatz guide wire for a sharp recanalization set, advanced through
     the nephrostomy tube access.  The 20-gauge puncture needle was advanced
     towards the ileum under triangulation.
     
     After three passes, it was then possible to exchange the system for a
     Glidewire which entered into the ileal loop.  It was advanced to the exit of
     the ileal loop, was grasped from the outside, and a through-and-through system
     was established.  This because necessary to provide the dilatation of the
     tight stenosis of the ureteral system.  The dilatation was performed by first
     advancing a long 8-French peel-away sheath into the left distal ureter and to
     advance a glide catheter through the ileal loop over the through-and-through
     system.  With this system, it was possible to pre-dilate.  With a junk wire,
     the determination was then made that a 35-cm-long drainage tube would be of
     sufficient length.  Then, an 8-French 35-cm Flexima catheter (""biliary
     drainage catheter"") was advanced from the ileal end.  A dilatation to 8 French
     was performed by advancing the entire through-and-through system from the

     attempts to traverse the stenosis with a back end of a Glidewire and an
     Amplatz wire were not successful due to the firm nature.  Therefore, the
     decision was made to proceed with a sharp recanalization.
     
     For this purpose, it became necessary to catheterize the patient's ileal loop.
      A 5-French Cobra glide catheter was advanced with aid of a Glidewire into the
     loop.  It was used to perform a loopogram.  This loopogram demonstrated free
     reflux into the small right kidney, however, no filling of the distal ureter.
     Having aligned now the ileal loop and the distal ureter, exchange was made
     over an Amplatz guide wire for a sharp recanalization set, advanced through
     the nephrostomy tube access.  The 20-gauge puncture needle was advanced
     towards the ileum under triangulation.
     
     After three passes, it was then possible to exchange the system for a
     Glidewire which entered into the ileal loop.  It was advanced to the exit of
     the ileal loop, was grasped from the outside, and a through-and-through system
     was established.  This because necessary to provide the dilatation of the
     tight stenosis of the ureteral system.  The dilatation was performed by first
     advancing a long 8-French peel-away sheath into the left distal ureter and to
     advance a glide catheter through the ileal loop over the through-and-through
     system.  With this system, it was possible to pre-dilate.  With a junk wire,
     the determination was then made that a 35-cm-long drainage tube would be of
     sufficient length.  Then, an 8-French 35-cm Flexima catheter (""biliary
     drainage catheter"") was advanced from the ileal end.  A dilatation to 8 French
     was performed by advancing the entire through-and-through system from the
     ileal loop towards the renal exit.  To preserve access, a safety wire in form
     of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 223**] guide wire was placed into the proximal right ureter.  After
     advancement of the catheter into the renal pelvis from the ileal loop side,
     the through-and-through wire was removed from the renal end and a pigtail
     catheter was formed in the renal collecting system.  A final nephrostogram was
     performed.  It demonstrated the pigtail in good position.  There were some
     blood clots within the renal collecting system.  The safety wire was removed.
     The external end of the external/internal ureteral catheter was sutured to the
     external site of the ileostomy and let drain into the drainage bag.
     
     During the four-hour procedure, the patient received a total of 3 mg Versed,
     300 mcg fentanyl and 25 mg Demerol in divided doses and under continuous
     monitoring, for conscious sedation. His vital signs were monitored throughout
     and were stable. At the end, he developed some shivers, for which he had
     received the Demerol. He also received droperidol to combat nausea.
     
     He left for Recovery in stable condition.  There were no immediate
     complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Very firm occlusion of the distal left ureter.  Successful
     recanalization and dilatation up to 8 French with placement of an
                                                                 (Over)

      OBSTRUCTION ON LEFT W/NEPHROSTOMY TUBE
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      OBSTRUCTING OF DISTAL LEFT URETER NEAR ILEAL ANASTOMOSIS

      INSERTION OF NEPHROURETERAL STENT LEFT
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     History: S/P resection of bladder CA and ileal loop construction, status post
     radiation therapy.  Now obstruction of the left distal ureter.
     
     PROCEDURE:  This procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 6112**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 2109**] and [**Doctor Last Name 400**],
     with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 400**] being present and supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     30 min prior to the procedure he received 1 g Ceftriaxon IV. Local anesthesia
     was applied over the indwelling left- sided nephrostomy tube. An initial
     nephrostogram was performed.  It demonstrated the indwelling tube to be in
     good position.  The renal collecting system was decompressed. Urine could be
     followed distally to the anticipated level of the anastomosis with the ileum,
     however, urine would not transit, also with the patient in a semi- upright
     position.
     
     The decision was made to proceed with conversion to an internal/external
     ureteral stent.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 223**] guide wire was advanced through the tube, it was
     removed, however, the [**Last Name (un) 223**] guide wire became entangled with the spring-
     retention mechanism of the nephrostomy tube and the entire access had to be
     abandoned.  Based on the prior nephrostograms, there were only a few posterior
     calices, and therefore reinsufflation of the non-contrast-filled superior
     polar calix became necessary.  For this purposes, a 20-gauge needle was
     advanced under fluoroscopic guidance into the left renal collecting system.
     Apparently it traversed an artery, since there was some blood entering into
     the renal collecting system.  The superior posterior pole calix was
     identified.  It was entered with an 18-gauge needle.  Over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 223**] guide
     wire, a 5-French angiographic sheath was advanced into the distal ureter.
     Subsequently, a 5-French Cobra glide catheter was used and advanced into the
     distal ureter.  Attempts were made to cross the stenosis, with a .035 angled
     Glidewire, a roadrunner guide wire and an extra stiff guide wire.  Also,
                                                                 (Over)

Admission Date:  [**3438-8-18**]     Discharge Date:  [**3438-8-21**]

Date of Birth:   [**3369-12-20**]     Sex:  M

Service:  Urology
REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Admitted for observation after a
nephroureteral stent placement on [**8-17**], after which he
had an episode of hypotension.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 68-year-old male with a
ileal loop urinary diversion, who presented with distal left
ureteral obstruction with hydronephrosis and a minimally
functioning right kidney, who had a left nephroureteral stent
placed by IR.  Status post procedure, the patient
experienced chills and a drop in blood pressure and became
tachycardic but was afebrile at that time in the operating
room.  In the Postanesthesia Care Unit temperature came up to
was admitted for observation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Bladder [**Last Name (un) 11917**] rwith positive LN's.
2.  Hypertension.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:   Radical cystectomy, ileal loop
diversion.

ALLERGIES:  HALDOL and AMBIEN.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Atenolol, Prilosec, Colace,
vitamin, psyllium, Benadryl.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Physical examination was
unremarkable except for the urostomy which was bloody, status
post stent placement.

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  Admission white blood cell count
was 11.4.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   Later on during the night he became
hypotensive and was bolused until his pressure was
re-established.  On [**8-18**], he had a temperature maximum
of 100.3, and 99.5 was his current temperature in the
morning.  His blood pressure dropped to 82/45 with a white
blood cell count which increased to 23.8.  He was immediately
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for a more
monitored setting where he was bolused, and his pressures
came up to 100/60, eventually reaching 130s/70s to 150s/70s,
with a heart rate around 90 the following day.

Infectious Disease was consulted, and they advised that we
start the patient on ceftazidime and vancomycin, which was
done.  Cultures taken from the patient were still pending and
were negative.  The patient was taken to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit on [**8-19**] where it was again noted
that his baseline creatinine was in fact 5, and there was no
acute renal insufficiency.

In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, even though his pressure
was kept up, he was receiving normal saline at 250 cc an hour
and received two to three boluses.  His pressures remained
good, and his urine output remained sufficient as well.

On [**8-19**], the patient was then transferred back to the
floor out of the Intensive Care Unit continuing his regimen
of vancomycin and ceftazidime, and his pressure remained
good.

On hospital day three, we found that his 4 a.m. laboratories
returned with a white blood cell count of 23.4 which was up
from a [**8-19**] complete blood count white blood cell
count of 22.7.  The decision was made to keep him one more
day for intravenous antibiotics and to discharge him home on
[**8-21**] with p.o. antibiotic regimens.

Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5053**].
