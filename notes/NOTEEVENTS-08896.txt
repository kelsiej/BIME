HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 70-year-old man with
severe vascular disease including peripheral vascular disease
and coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
and atrial fibrillation on Coumadin therapy, who presented to
the Emergency Room complaining of one day of abdominal pain.
The morning of admission, the patient had multiple episodes
of bright red hematemesis.  In the Emergency Room, the
patient was found to be hypotensive, with a blood pressure of
90/45 and a hematocrit of 15.  Nasogastric tube lavage was
done, which showed bright red blood, which did not clear
after 2 liters of nasogastric lavage.  The patient was
intubated for airway protection, and had an episode of
bradycardia into the 40s.  The patient had an emergent
esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which showed spurting Dieulafoy
lesion in the fundus, which was successfully cauterized using
BICAP and injected with epinephrine.  Hemostasis was
achieved.  The endoscopy was otherwise normal.

The patient's blood pressure then increased to 200/100 with a
heart rate of 125.  He received six units of packed red blood
cells and two units of fresh frozen plasma in the Emergency
Room.  He had multiple attempts to gain access during his
emergent workup in the Emergency Room, with a failed left
femoral stick, left subcutaneous stick, and left external
jugular stick.  He finally had successful placement of a
right femoral line and a right external jugular line, as well
as a right hand line.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Includes coronary artery disease
status post bypass surgery in [**3408**] and percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**3415-12-29**], one of
the obtuse marginal II, hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
hypercholesterolemia, chronic renal insufficiency with a
baseline creatinine of 1.5, peripheral vascular disease, left
femoral-popliteal bypass redone in [**3417-1-28**],
arthritis, cerebrovascular accident in [**3408**] on the right,
with subsequent right carotid endarterectomy, atrial
fibrillation, bilateral fifth toe amputation, and
perioperative myocardial infarction in [**3417-2-28**].

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Dilaudid, percocet, Lopressor,
Coumadin, aspirin, Norvasc, Colace, Lipitor,
hydrochlorothiazide, Zantac, iron, multivitamin.  There is
some question of whether the patient had been taking his
Coumadin as an outpatient.  According to his primary care
provider, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] had been discontinued because the patient
was noncompliant with INR checks, however, the patient states
that he had been taking Coumadin at home.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   Occasional alcohol.  He is a former tobacco
smoker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Vitals on admission:  Blood pressure
200/100, heart rate in the 120s. General:  He was intubated
and sedated.  Skin showed no jaundice.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose and throat examination showed excessive blood in the
oropharynx.  His abdomen was soft, distended, and nontender.

LABORATORY DATA:   On admission, white count 10.6, hematocrit
15 increased to 22.9 after two units of blood, platelets 114,
PT 14.8, INR 1.5, PTT 30.8.  Lactate 5.9.  Sodium 143,
potassium 3.8, chloride 112, bicarbonate 12, BUN 66,
creatinine 1.6, glucose 244.  ALT 5, AST 8.  CK 42, alkaline
phosphatase 28, amylase 42, total bilirubin 0.1.  Calcium
6.7, albumin 2.1, phosphate 5.2.  Electrocardiogram showed
possible sinus rhythm with ventricular trigeminy, left axis
deviation, right bundle branch block, ST depressions in V3
through V6.  X-ray showed cardiomegaly, no infiltrates, no
pneumothorax, and adequate placement of the endotracheal
tube.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit for further management of his large
gastrointestinal bleed.

1.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient had successful
intervention by the Gastroenterology service via endoscopy
for his Dieulafoy lesion in the Emergency Room.  He was sent
to the Intensive Care Unit, and started on Protonix at 8
mg/hour continuous infusion.  He had his Coumadin and aspirin
held, and his hematocrit was checked every four hours.  He
was given fresh frozen plasma in the Emergency Room to
maintain an INR less than 1.5.  The patient had no further
episodes of hematemesis or melena, and was thought not to
have any further gastrointestinal bleeding throughout his
hospital stay.  He was followed by the Gastroenterology
service throughout his course.  He was gradually weaned from
Protonix continuous infusion to Protonix 40 mg intravenously
twice a day, and finally Protonix 40 mg by mouth twice a day.
This will be continued as an outpatient.  He was initially
made nothing by mouth, but then gradually his diet was
advanced, which he tolerated well, with no nausea, vomiting,
or other symptoms.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient has known coronary artery
disease, and showed ischemic electrocardiogram changes in the
Emergency Room d[**MD Number 1142**] his acute gastrointestinal bleed.  At
that time, he also did complain of some chest pains.  He was
therefore evaluated for possible myocardial infarction in the
context of his massive gastrointestinal bleed.  His CK levels
rose to a peak of 2000 on [**3417-5-13**], with an MB fraction
of 320, and his troponin peaked at a level greater than 50.
The patient had one further episode of 6/10 chest pain the
night before discharge, with very tiny .5 mm depressions in
the ST segment of V4 and V5.  These resolved after the pain
was treated successfully with two sublingual nitroglycerin
tablets.  The Cardiology service followed the patient
throughout his hospital stay, and were made aware of these
changes.  Therefore, their recommendations were pending at
the time of discharge.

The patient had standard post-acute myocardial infarction
medical care, including monitoring on telemetry for 72 hours
after his event.  Telemetry revealed only one short episode
of supraventricular tachycardia for 12 beats.  He was started
on an ACE inhibitor, which was titrated up as tolerated to
Zestril 10 mg by mouth once daily.  This was tolerated very
well from a cardiovascular point of view, however, the
patient does have a cough that developed during this hospital
stay which, if it does not resolve, may require changing his
ACE inhibitor to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 367**] to investigate whether the ACE
inhibitor is the underlying cause for this cough.  The
patient was also continued on Lopressor 25 mg by mouth three
times a day, which was changed to Toprol XL 25 mg by mouth
once daily.  He was initially on a nitrate drip, which was
then changed over to Imdur 30 mg by mouth once daily.  He
will continue on aspirin 325 mg by mouth once daily, and
Lipitor 10 mg by mouth once daily.

Should the patient have recurrent chest pain, the Cardiology
service may want to consider further workup with another
cardiac catheterization.

The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
We did not anticoagulate him d[**MD Number 1142**] his hospital stay.  He
did not have any episodes of atrial fibrillation during this
hospitalization.  The patient's blood pressure was well
controlled with his cardiac regimen.

The patient had an echocardiogram after his myocardial
infarction, which revealed an ejection fraction of 45 to 50%.
The left atrium was mildly dilated. There was mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy.  There was mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction, with inferobasal and
inferoseptal severe hypokinesis and akinesis.  The right
ventricle was normal.  There was mild aortic regurgitation
and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.  Both of these
valvular findings were worse compared to his echocardiogram
in [**3407-5-29**].

3.  Pulmonary:  The patient was ventilated overnight, the
night of admission, for airway protection.  He was extubated
the following morning without any complication.  Chest x-ray
was done on the 15th, and again the 17th and the 19th.  The
patient showed no evidence for pneumonia, but did have
bibasilar atelectasis.  The patient developed a cough during
this hospital stay, which was treated symptomatically with
Tessalon Perles and Robitussin.  The patient had no evidence
for pneumonia, and the cough was thought to be secondary to
his recent intubation, however, the patient was also started
on ACE inhibitor therapy during this hospitalization, and if
the cough does not resolve, it is possible that the cough may
be due to the new ACE inhibitor.  This will need to be
followed up as an outpatient.

The patient, on transfer from the Intensive Care Unit, was on
5 liters of oxygen, which was gradually weaned to off, and
the patient was maintaining good oxygen saturations greater
than 96% on room air at the time of discharge.  The patient's
oxygen requirement was felt to be due to volume overload
after the patient received multiple units of blood and
intravenous fluids during his resuscitation.  The patient was
gradually diuresed back to his admission weight.  As the
patient was diuresed, his oxygen requirement diminished.

4.  Hematology:  The patient was transfused to maintain a
hematocrit greater than 32%.  The patient had received six
units of blood in the Emergency Room, and a further unit in
the Intensive Care Unit prior to transfer to the floor.  The
patient then received an additional two units on the floor.
His hematocrit was stable upon discharge.

The patient also was noted to have thrombocytopenia of
uncertain etiology.  It reached a nadir of about 90.  These
were increasing at the time of discharge.

5.  Infectious Disease:  The patient was not thought to have
any infection during his hospital stay.  He did have a
low-grade temperature, running 99 to 100.  This was felt most
likely due to atelectasis.  Chest x-ray did not reveal any
pneumonia, and urinalysis and urine culture were negative for
urinary tract infection.

6.  Endocrine:  The patient has diabetes Type 2, which is
diet controlled at home.  While the patient was on the floor,
he had his blood glucose checked with finger sticks four
times a day.  His blood sugars remained less than 200 the
entire stay, and only were above 150 on one occasion.  He did
not require any subcutaneous insulin during his hospital
stay.  The patient can continue on a diet-control regimen for
now, with addition of oral agents as needed as an outpatient.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Gastrointestinal bleed from a Dieulafoy lesion
2.  Acute myocardial infarction

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Improving.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To [**Hospital 436**] Rehabilitation for short-term
rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lasix 40 mg by mouth once daily,
Zestril 10 mg by mouth once daily, Imdur 30 mg by mouth once
daily, enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg by mouth once daily,
Protonix 40 mg by mouth twice a day, folate 1 mg by mouth
once daily, Robitussin AC 10 ml by mouth four times a day as
needed, Tessalon Perles 200 mg by mouth three times a day,
Ambien 5 mg by mouth daily at bedtime as needed, Cepacol
lozenge one by mouth every eight hours as needed, Lipitor 10
mg by mouth once daily, Toprol XL 25 mg by mouth once daily,
and nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingually every five minutes x 3
as needed for chest pain.

FOLLOW UP:  With his primary care provider, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 3032**].

     are no new focal consolidations or pneumothoraces. There are stable small
     pleural effusions.  There has been no change in a focal confluent opacity seen
     on the lateral view in the retrocardiac space which likely represents a

     There is apparently a jump graft off the described left-sided graft, at the
     origin of this jump graft, the velocity is approximately 760 cm/sec,
     indicating a high grade stenosis. The jump graft can be followed below the
     knee to approximately the proximal calf, demonstrating flow and velocities
     which decline to 40 cm/sec.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1. Patent right-sided fem [**Hospital Unit Name 609**] bypass graft.
     2. Patent left fem [**Hospital Unit Name 609**] bypass graft, apparent jump graft with proximal
     anastomotic stenosis. Please correlate findings with known surgery (prior exam
     of [**1-/3417**] demonstrated no definite jump graft, a distal anastomotic stenosis
     in a fem [**Hospital Unit Name 609**] graft).

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION;  70 year old man with peripheral vascular disease.  Status post
     lower extremity bypass graft, now with non-healing left foot ulcer.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 6030**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 2109**], and [**Doctor Last Name 6**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6**], the attending
     radiologist, was present and supervised the critical portions of the
     procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE: The risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the
     patient and informed consent was obtained.  The patient's left groin was
     prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Ultrasound was used to identify the
     site of the proximal graft anastomosis.  Subsequently, the left common femoral
     artery was accessed proximal to the anastomosis with a 19 gauge needle. A .035
     wire was passed through the needle and into the abdominal aorta under
     fluoroscopic control.  A 4 FR straight tip multi-side-hole catheter was then
     exchanged for the needle and advanced over the wire into the abdominal aorta
     under fluoroscopic control.  An abdominal aortic angiogram was performed in
     the AP projection.  The catheter was then withdrawn to just above the aortic
     bifurcation and a pelvic angiogram was performed in the right anterior oblique
     projection.  ""Pull down"" pressures were then obtained through the catheter
     from the distal aorta to the left external iliac artery.  A left lower
     extremity run-off was then performed.  The catheter was withdrawn and manual
     pressure was applied to the left groin until hemostasis was achieved. The
     patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate post-procedure
     complications.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:  160 cc of Optiray 320.  No intravenous medications were
     given.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is diffuse atherosclerotic plaques throughout the abdominal
     aorta.  The renal arteries are patent bilaterally.  There is no pressure
     gradient from the abdominal aorta to the left external iliac artery.  There is
     diffuse mild iliac disease bilaterally.  The left common femoral artery is
     patent to the proximal anastomosis.  The femoral- popliteal graft is patent to
     the takeoff of the jump graft.  Beyond this there are numerous non-
     occlusive stenoses as well as a tight stenosis near the distal anastamosis.
     The jump graft [**Doctor Last Name 11445**] is patent but just distal there is a 80 to 90% stenosis.
                                                                 (Over)

     Comparison is made to [**3417-5-16**] at 11:06.
     
     There are CABG clips and median sternotomy wires, unchanged.
     
     There is a stable left ventricular configuration of the cardiac silhouette.
     However, the pulmonary vasculature remains within normal limits.  There is
     resolution of a small left-sided pleural effusion.  On the lateral view, a
     confluent opacity described on the prior study is less prominent and this
     leads credence to the theory that it represents a combination of degenerative
     changes and superimposition of pulmonary vasculature.  There are no areas of
     focal consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
     2.  Resolution of small left-sided pleural effusion.
     3.  Decreased prominence of area of confluence that was brought to attention
     on the previous study.  This region most likely represents degenerative spine
     changes with overlying pulmonary vessels.  Attention to this region should be
     paid on further radiographs.

     FINDINGS:  Duplex evaluation was performed of the left lower extremity
     arterial system with concentration on the femoral popliteal and in the jump
     graft from the mid thigh to the posterior tibial.  Peak systolic velocities in
     cm/sec. are as follows:  140, 106, 220, 770 in the native proximal femoral
     artery, proximal anastomosis, anastomosis of the jump graft and in the
     proximal jump graft.  In the proximal femoral popliteal portion the velocities
     are all normal.  Several cm distal to the high grade stenosis of the jump
     graft there is another velocity of 576 which is consistent with a greater than
     75% stenosis.  Distal to that the velocities range from 56 to 150.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Greater than 90% stenosis of the proximal portion of the left
     posterior tibial artery jump graft as well as another area of high grade

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Dropping hematocrit.  Evaluate for source of blood loss.  The
     patient has multiple medical problems.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non contrast images were obtained from the lung bases to the pubic
     symphysis.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST:  No pleural effusions, nodules or
     opacities are present at the lung bases.  The base of the heart is grossly
     unremarkable.  Non contrast images of the liver, gallbladder, spleen, adrenals
     and pancreas are within normal limits.  Within both kidneys are well
     circumscribed low attenuation foci likely simple renal cysts.  There are
     extensive vascular calcifications.  There is no intraabdominal free fluid or
     free air.  There is no evidence of bowel wall hematoma although this is
     limited without oral contrast.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST:  Again there are extensive vascular
     calcifications.  The unopacified colon is grossly unremarkable.  There is no
     pelvic free fluid.  There is no evidence of retroperitoneal or groin hematoma.
      The urinary bladder is distended.  There are course calcifications within the
     prostate.  There is no pelvic free fluid.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are degenerative changes in the lower lumbar spine and a
     well circumscribed sclerotic foci in the right femoral neck, likely a bone
     island.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  No evidence of hemorrhage within the abdomen or pelvis.
     2)  Coarse vascular calcifications.
     3)  Bilateral low attenuation areas in both kidneys, likely simple renal
     cysts.
     4)  Sclerotic area in the right femoral neck, likely a bone island.  Correlate

      from jejunum.

      interventional rads to stop the active site of bleeding.                        
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  GI bleeding with positive tagged red blood cell scan.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:   [**Doctor Last Name 4701**] and [**Doctor Last Name 6**].  The attending radiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6**],
     was present and supervised the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Written and signed, informed consent were obtained from the
     patient.  The right groin was prepped in sterile fashion and the right femoral
     pulse palpated.  The right common femoral artery was accessed by a 19 g.
     single wall needle with prompt return of bright pulsatile blood.  A .035
     [**Last Name (un) 223**] wire was then inserted into the vessel lumen and passed into the
     proximal abdominal aorta under fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was replaced
     over the wire with a 4 French sheath set and a 4 French Omni-flush catheter
     was inserted under fluoroscopic guidance along the wire into the proximal
     abdominal aorta.  The wire was removed and a contrast angiogram was performed,
     demonstrating an aorta of normal caliber and multiple celiac artery branches.
     
     The Omni-flush catheter was then exchanged for a 4 French Sos-Omni catheter
     and gently pulled down to engage in an anterior aortic vessel branch at
     approximately T12-L1. A small hand contrast injection showed that this was the
     celiac trunk and another contrast angiogram was performed, demonstrating
     normal celiac axis anatomy.  No active extravasation or areas of contrast
     blush were appreciated.  The catheter was removed and several attempts were
     made to engage the [**Female First Name (un) **].  Due to this difficulty the Sos-Omni catheter was
     exchanged for a 4 French Cobra catheter, which was then passed into the ostium
     of the SMA.  A contrast angiogram was performed, without evidence of contrast
     extravasation or abnormal vasculature.  A replaced right hepatic artery was
     seen branching from the SMA.
     
     A contrast angiogram of the lower abdominal aorta using the Omni-flush
     catheter was without evidence of [**Female First Name (un) **] patency.  Following these angiograms, the
     catheter and sheath were removed and hemostasis achieved with local pressure.
     The patient tolerated the procedure satisfactorily and there were no
     complications.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      70 year old man with CAD s/p CABG and multiple PTCA who has had 6 units of PRBC 
      transfused without any change in hct. Tagged red blood cell scan shows bleeding 
      from jejunum.  
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      interventional rads to stop the active site of bleeding.                        
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  GI bleeding with positive tagged red blood cell scan.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:   [**Doctor Last Name 4701**] and [**Doctor Last Name 6**].  The attending radiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6**],
     was present and supervised the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Written and signed, informed consent were obtained from the
     patient.  The right groin was prepped in sterile fashion and the right femoral
     pulse palpated.  The right common femoral artery was accessed by a 19 g.
     single wall needle with prompt return of bright pulsatile blood.  A .035
     [**Last Name (un) 223**] wire was then inserted into the vessel lumen and passed into the
     proximal abdominal aorta under fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was replaced
     over the wire with a 4 French sheath set and a 4 French Omni-flush catheter
     was inserted under fluoroscopic guidance along the wire into the proximal
     abdominal aorta.  The wire was removed and a contrast angiogram was performed,
     demonstrating an aorta of normal caliber and multiple celiac artery branches.
     
     The Omni-flush catheter was then exchanged for a 4 French Sos-Omni catheter
     and gently pulled down to engage in an anterior aortic vessel branch at
     approximately T12-L1. A small hand contrast injection showed that this was the
     celiac trunk and another contrast angiogram was performed, demonstrating
     normal celiac axis anatomy.  No active extravasation or areas of contrast
     blush were appreciated.  The catheter was removed and several attempts were
     made to engage the [**Female First Name (un) **].  Due to this difficulty the Sos-Omni catheter was
     exchanged for a 4 French Cobra catheter, which was then passed into the ostium
     of the SMA.  A contrast angiogram was performed, without evidence of contrast
     extravasation or abnormal vasculature.  A replaced right hepatic artery was
     seen branching from the SMA.
     
     A contrast angiogram of the lower abdominal aorta using the Omni-flush
     catheter was without evidence of [**Female First Name (un) **] patency.  Following these angiograms, the
     catheter and sheath were removed and hemostasis achieved with local pressure.
     The patient tolerated the procedure satisfactorily and there were no
     complications.
     
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Routine surveillance in a 70-year-old man status post right
     femoral popliteal arterial bypass and left femoral popliteal bypass graft and
     left jump graft up to the posterior tibial artery. Known severe stenosis in
     the proximal portion of the left jump graft with balloon angioplasty of the
     stenosis intraoperatively.
     
     FINDINGS: Grey scale ultrasonography, color Doppler ultrasound examination,
     and analysis of spectral Doppler wave forms were performed at the level of the
     bilateral bypass as well as the native arteries upstream and downstream of
     these bypasses.
     
     On the right, the femoral popliteal bypass is patent. Its diameter is measured
     at 0.57 cm proximally and 0.63 cm distally. The peak systolic velocities are
     measured at 101 cm/second in the right and common femoral arteries, 59
     cm/second in the proximal bypass anastomosis, 65-100 cm/second in the graft
     itself, and 76 cm/second at the distal bypass anastomosis.
     
     On the left, both femoral popliteal bypass and the distal jump graft are
     patent. The bypass diameter is measured at 0.48 cm proximally and 0.40 cm
     distally. The peak systolic velocity is measured at 110 cm/second in the
     native left common femoral artery, 86 cm/second at the proximal upper bypass
     anastomosis, 90-120 cm/second in the left femoral popliteal bypass itself, 284
     cm/second in the anastomosis between the femoral popliteal bypass and the
     distal jump graft, 107-128 cm/second at the level of the distal jump graft
     itself, 140 cm/second at the distal bypass anastomosis at the ankle, and 133
     cm/second in the distal native posterior tibial artery.
     
     CONCLUSIONS: Patent bilateral peripheral arterial bypasses, with known
     stenosis at the anastomosis between the left femoral popliteal and distal jump
     bypass.

     INDICATIONS:  Patient is status post bilateral bypass graft with continued leg
     pain, perform followup surviellance.
     
     ARTERIAL DUPLEX BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITIES:  Duplex evaluation was performed
     of both lower extremity bypass grafts.
     
     On the right there is a femoral to popliteal bypass graft. The peak systolic
     velocities  in cm per second are as follows: 99, 52, 60, 267 in the native
     proximal vessel, proximal anastomosis, distal anastomosis, and native distal
     vessel respectively. Throughout the body of the graft velocities range from 52
     through 74.  This is consistent with a widely patent right femoral popliteal
     bypass graft. However, there appears to be some development of intrinsic
     disease/stenosis in the native popliteal artery.
     
     On the left, there is a femoral popliteal and a bypass graft with a jump graft
     from the level of the knee down to the posterior tibial artery. Peak systolic
     velocities  in cm per second are as follows: 79, 75, 200, 94, 116 in the
     common femoral artery, proximal anastomosis, take off of the jump graft,
     distal anastomosis, and posterior tibial artery respectively. Throughout the
     body of the proximal graft, velocities range from 89 to 110.  Within the
     distal graft velocities range from 80 to 124.  This is consistent with a
     widely patent graft with less than 50% stenosis at the level of the jump
     graft. This is improvement from prior study.
     
     IMPRESSION:   On the right there is a widely patent right femoral popliteal
     bypass graft. There appears to be a developing stenosis in the distal native
     popliteal artery. On the left there is a widely patent femoral popliteal and
     jump graft from the posterior tibial artery. There is an less than 50%
     stenosis at the level from the take off of the jump graft. This is marked
     improvement from the prior study.

PT came to hospital after feeling SOB at home, "" It started yesterday, Not breathing too good"", then today he again experienced SOB while he was sitting looking out the window. He also felt some chest pain which was relieved when he took 2 SL Nitro. Later he says the SOB came back and he called EMS. Pt came to CCU and became acutely SOB during transfer, and once again later, taking off clothing and c/o of being hot and unable to breathe, he was also diaphoretic and o2  sat was 88-92. Pt placed on 4L NC and 100 non rebreather, was given Lasix 120 mg IV and then Morphine 3mg first event, then later  by 4 mg, and Nitro drip was titrated up. He did respond to measures, and appears much more comfortable. Lungs sounds rales [**1-29**] way up,  right more so than left. Pt did receive alb/atrovent for his copd, and in ER pt was given 40 mg IV lasix and levoquin 750 mg for a possible PNA. CXR shows mild chf with posible lower lobe PNA. 
He has complicated PMH and was just dc'd from here 10 days ago after having NSTEMI, two trips to cath lab for angioplasty and stent to LIMA,  as well as  CHF on lasix drip. He has PMH of COPD, CAD, CABG, 
DM 2, GI bleed,  He lives alone but has a son [**Name (NI) **] who lives in same building in floor above. Pt states that his son knows he is in hospital but will likely visit after work. 
 Here in CCU as well as ER, pt has been having acute episodes of respiratory distress, appears to be flash pulmonary edema, he was tried on CPAP mask ventilation but was unable to tolerate the mask and became very agitated. He has been successfully treated with IV morphine and nitro, He has not responded to lasix and team is well aware of this. Urine output 500 cc in ER, then 40  cc here, after lasix 19 cc for a total of 559 output. Pt deniews CP and says that he hasnt had any since admission, he is oriented x 3 and converses. 
currently pt is resting in bed and appears conmfortable.

A: Pt with acute SOb, CHF, pna. Full code. 

P: Pt not responding to lasix may need diuril and  lasix drip, will likely need central access, PICC or triple lumen, team updated. Continue to monitor CV and resp status, MSo4 PRN SOB, continue to titrate NTG drip, keep pt and family updated on POC as discussed in CCU rounds.
