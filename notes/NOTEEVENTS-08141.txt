bronchoscopy
 
History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 82 yo male with a history of COPD/asthma(on home 
O2-3LNC), HTN presented to [**Hospital3 2177**] with shortness of 
breath. History obtained per medical records from outside 
hospital. He was given nebs and lasix with little improvement. 
Also complained of chest pain on initial presentation. He then 
required intubation given tenuous respiratory status. Emergent 
bronch was done which demonstrated exophytic mass. Pulm at 
outside hospital felt that he needed argon laser therapy and was 
thus transferred to [**Hospital1 83**]. After intubation and Rt subclavian 
central line placement his SBP dropped into the 70-80 range. He 
was bolused and started on levophed which was titrated off. He 
was also given azithromycin, vanco, and ceftrizaxone and high 
dose steroids for possible PNA dn COPD exacerbation.  
.  
Per discussion with his wife he has been having worsening SOB 
for the last week with increased and cough with yellow sputum. 
Has been having trouble sleeping at night. He has been eating 
well. No recent weight loss. No chest pain except for what was 
noted on admission. No nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena,

CXR- Bilateral lower lobe infiltrates Rt>Lt. Bilateral hilar 
fullness. ETT 8cm above carina. Right subclavian in SVC.  

 
Bronch [**2806-4-25**]: Large fungating papillary mass, suggestive of 
papillomatosis involving L mainstem and L arytenoid.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
 82 yo M with COPD/asthma presents with respiratory failure, 
probably due to COPD/papillomatosis.  
.  
Respiratory Failure- Appeared to be multifactorial from 
multifocal pneumonia in RLL field, COPD, and obstructing mass in 
bronchi.  
OSH culture = Moraxella, beta-lactamase producing.  Was started 
on CTX/Azithro, and vanco was added.   Aggressive 
Bronchodilators, steroid taper was also begun. 
Bronchoscopy by IP showed mass to be pappilomatosis, caused by 
HPV.  They removed the largest of the masses, and referred the 
patient to 
.
 Hypotension- Occurred after intubation in the setting of 
sedation and mechanical ventilation. Also concern for septic 
picture given possible pneumonia and elevated WBC. However 
hypotension likely related to sedation and autoPEEP  
levophed was started for MAPs<65 -> Off [**2806-4-24**].  

On hospital day 4, the patient developed tachycardia with an 
atrial fibrillation rhythm.  Attempts were made to decrease his 
heart rate with lopressor and diltiazem.  His blood pressure 
began to drift slowly down, and amiodarone was begun to try to 
chemically convert him to a sinus rhythm.  On the amiodarone 
bolus, his blood pressure dropped to the 60s for 15 minutes.  
The amio was stopped.  Nor-epinephrine was started, with no 
effect.  Levophed was then begun, with a rise in his blood 
pressure.  A few hours later, on HD 5, the patietn's blodd 
pressure again dropped and he developed bradycardia.  A short 
period of CPR was begun, with return to a perfusing rhythm.  The 
patient's family decided at this time that the patient would not 
wish to be maintained on the ventilator or have CPR performed.  
Pressors were maxed out, and when this appeared to be 
unsuccessful, the patietn was  extubated at the wishes of his 
family, and he expired 20 minutes later.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      82 year old man transferred from OSH with hemoptysis and report of possible PNA 
      and or CHF, currently intubated.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Please evaluate for infiltrates, fluid overload                                 
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     EXAMINATION:  AP chest.
     
     INDICATION:  Hemoptysis.  Pneumonia.
     
     Single AP view of the chest is obtained [**2806-4-23**] at 2155 hours.  No prior films
     are available for comparison.
     
     The patient is intubated with the tip of the ET tube approx 7.5 cm above
     the carina. There is a right subclavian line with the tip in the SVC. A ng
     tube has its tip in the gastric fundus.
     
     The heart is likely top normal in size. There is a patchy opacity in the right
     mid lung field and to a lesser extent in the right lower lobe consistent with
     pneumonia.  In addition, there is increased density in the right side adjacent
     to the heart border consistent with a degree of right lower lobe collapse.
     Right pleural effusion and likely small left pleural effusion are present.
     There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     Without prior comparison films, I feel that the findings likely represent
     multifocal pneumonia with likely superimposed fluid overload/early failure.

     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**4-23**] through 9:
     
     ET tube in standard placement.  Right subclavian line tip projects over the
     upper SVC.  No pneumothorax.  Enlarged left hilus is probably due to dilated
     pulmonary artery.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Distal to the carina the
     central airways are very poorly defined such that airway lesions could be
     present.  Region of consolidation or atelectasis projects over but does not
     obscure the right hilus which is normal caliber.  Small bilateral pleural
     effusions are present.  No pneumothorax.

Resp-  Pt. placed on PSV 10/5 and tolerated well until requiring trendelenburg position for prolonged period of time during line attempts. Then, pt. placed back on A/c for duration of procedure.  Minimal sx'd from ETT.  Sat's running low 90's-95%.  Will send ABG this evening as pt. back on PSV.  LS- very difficult to appreciate, more airmovement noteable on RLL than Left side which is suprising given location of obstuction.  CXR reported as showing more fluid than yesterday w/ bilat pleural effusion and pna of RLL.

CV-  Persistent AFLUTTER/ FIB, never converting to NSR.  Rate controlled w/ Diltiazem IVP 10mg X 2.  However, not holding.  Required 1L FB in order to sustain BP in the setting of rapid rate to 155bpm.  Pt. extremely edemedous and weepy w/ impaired skin integrity on upper extremeties.  Central access needed.

GI-  ABD obese, hypoactive BS.  TF restarted given low GI aspirate.  Nutren Pulmonary w/ goal of 50cc/hr.  No stool.  

GU-  u/o adequate, marginal at times.  

ID-  On azithromycin and ceftriaxone for tx of post obstructive pna.  Airborne precautions given r/o of TB and HPV.  

Social-  Wife and various family members in today and updated by myself.

Respiratory Care
Breath sounds bilaterally diminished, suctioned for very minimal thick clear secretions, switched from AC to PSV this morning, was doing fine, then around 1530 had to have subclavian line placement which finally was unsuccessful, patient has been switched back to AC during line placement attempt( was also in trendelenberg),then, was put back on PSV, at 1744 patient became tachypneic and breathing was labored, had to be put back on AC, was treated whole day with Albuterol and atrovent inhalers, , was afebrile and stayed constantly into atrial flutter, is on Fentanyl and Versed, will continue to be treated, monitored and provided with ventilatory support.

Event note-  Pt. given 150mg bolus of Amiodorone to attempt cardioversion in the setting of ABP 80's (MAP 66).  HR at the time was low 100's Aflutter.  BP dropped percipitiously to SBP 40's.  Neosynephrine started and quickly increased.  SBP not as responsive.  Levophed then started and escalted quickly.  SBP responded quickly to levophed.  Currently, Neo being weaned down to tolerate MAPS of 60.  At some point, pt. rhythm changed to NSR and an EKG is being done to confirm.  Of note, pt. found to have eyes wide open and agonal breathing pattern during the pre-arrest state.  Fentanyl had been stopped d/t hypotension (for a few minutes).  Fentanyl added and bolused (12.5mcg) once BP obtained.  Please see careview of exact VS and values.  ABG results pending...

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  82-year-old man with COPD, congestive heart failure and
     pneumonia, now with fevers.  
     
     COMPARISON:  Prior chest x-rays from [**2806-4-23**] through [**2806-4-27**].
     
     AP SEMI-UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY:  The study is limited by patient
     positioning.  The lung bases are incompletely imaged.  The patient remains
     intubated with the endotracheal tube tip 6 cm above the carina.  A nasogastric
     tube descends below the diaphragm with the tip not visualized.  The
     cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, with significant aortic tortuosity.
     The right middle lobe remains collapsed.  Substantial left lower lobe
     atelectasis is incompletely imaged.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
     persist.  There is no pneumothorax on this semi-upright film.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Limited study due to patient positioning.  No interval change in
     bibasilar atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions.

Pt remains intubated on full vent support. No vent changes made this shift. BS slightly coarse bilaterally and diminished throughout. Suctioning for scant amounts of thick clear secretions. MDIs given as ordered. WBC^^, pt hypotensive, ^^Pressors therefore RSBI not completed at this time. ABG currently shows uncompensated metabolic acidosis, with good oxygenation. See CareVue for details and specifics. 
Plan: Maintain vent support.
