Admission Date:  [**3076-4-5**]       Discharge Date:  [**3076-4-7**]

Date of Birth:   [**3003-2-19**]       Sex:  M

Service:  Neurosurge

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
1.  Status post fall.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 11379**] is a 73 year-old
gentleman status post fall three days ago who struck his face
and nose on a chair rail. The patient was subsequently
evaluated at the [**Hospital **] [**Hospital6 3390**] Emergency
Department and was performed a CT scan that revealed a right
posterior parietal occipital hemorrhage. The patient was
subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 47**] for further evaluation as there were no beds at that
time in the [**Hospital **] Hospital.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Type II diabetes.
3.  Cognitive disorder.
4.  Delusional disorder.
5.  Question of cardiac arrhythmias.
6.  Psychiatric history.

ALLERGIES:
1.  Penicillin.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Valproic acid.
2.  Risperdal.
3.  Aspirin.
4.  Lipitor.
5.  Hydrochlorothiazide.
6.  Metformin.
7.  Sotalol.
8.  Trazodone.
9.  Valsartan.
10. Venlafaxine.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was oriented to place and
time.  He did not know the month but did the know the year.
Pupils were 2.5 mm right slightly greater than left but
reactive.  There was a left cataract. The patient was
following commands and had a small superficial abrasion over
the bridge of his nose.  His chest was clear.  His heart was
regular rate and rhythm. His belly was soft.  His extremities
were moving all four.  His strength is [**6-4**] bilaterally equal.
Sensory was intact throughout.  There was no clonus and his
reflexes were 1+ and bilaterally equal with no Babinski.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 12, hematocrit 39.8, platelet
count 158,000, sodium 137, potassium 3.4, chloride 98, bicarb
29, BUN 20, creatinine 1.  Sugar was 143, Valproic acid level
was 56, magnesium 2, CK 36, calcium 9.4, alkaline phosphatase
2.8.

He had a CT scan of the head that showed a right parietal
occipital intra parenchymal with a small extension to the
posterior [**Doctor Last Name **] of the right lateral ventricle.

HOSPITAL COURSE: He was admitted to the Neuro SICU for
observation to keep his INR less than 1.3, blood pressure
less than 140 and for bed rest with a repeat CT scan or MRI
the following day.  His INR on admission was 1.1.

On hospital day one the patient was doing well, following
commands and weaned off his Nipride and started on Lopressor
to bring his blood pressure down.  He was unable to have an
MRI because of previous hip surgery that had metal so he had
a CTA that showed no underlying lesion except for most likely
amyloid angiopathy.  He continued to have about the same
mental status exam with slight disorientation and
inattentiveness but will follow commands and is moving all
fours.

The Surgical service saw the patient and continued to offer
the same recommendations with blood pressure control and also
with the recommendation to avoid an anti-platelet [**Doctor Last Name 614**] if
this is in fact amyloid angiopathy which it does appear to
be.

He will be discharged today [**3076-4-7**] with a transfer to
the VA [**Hospital 782**] Hospital for continued care and
management. He will be discharged in stable condition.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  He will need to stay on his po
pressure medicines to keep his pressure in the 140 to 150
range. These medications are:
1.  Lopresor 75 milligrams po bid hold for systolic less than
95 and heart rate less than 60.
2.  Hydralazine 60 milligrams po q six hours.
He will remain on all of his other pre-medications which are:
1.  Valproic 500 milligrams po q HS.
2.  Risperdal 0.5 milligrams po q day.
3.  Lipitor 10 milligrams po q day.
4.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 milligrams po q day.
5.  Valsartan 80 milligrams po q day.
6.  Venlafaxine 75 milligrams po q day.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  He will be discharged to [**Location 782**] VA
system and should follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in approximately two
to three weeks if needed.

     Reason: ? BLEED
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      73 year old man with intraparenchymal bleed
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Please do Noncontrast Head CT after midafternoon on [**3076-4-5**] to r/o increased
      hemorrhage in this 73 yo [**Male First Name (un) **] with recent Rt. parieto-occipital hemorrhage seen
      on CT from OSH.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Intraparenchymal bleed.
     
     Multiple axial images were obtained from the base of the vertex without IV
     contrast administration.  No prior CT's are available for comparison at this
     institution.  There is a moderate sized area of subacute hemorrhage involving
     the right occipital parietal lobe with mild surrounding cytotoxic edema and
     minimal mass effect on the posterior aspect of the right lateral ventricle.
     There is a small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage layering within the
     left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 234**] of the lateral ventricle.  Extensive low attenuation is
     seen within the periventricular white matter suggestive of chronic
     microvascular infarct.  No mid-line shift is seen.  There is no impending
     herniation.  A benign tiny focus of calcification measuring less than 5 mm is
     seen abutting the peripheral aspect of the right cerebellum without
     surrounding mass effect.  The calvarium appears to be intact.  The visualized
     paranasal sinuses are mostly clear.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Acute area of intraparenchymal hemorrhage involving the right
     occipital parietal lobe which is seen probably dissecting into the right
     lateral ventricle with a small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage.
     Significant periventricular chronic microvascular disease.  There is no
     herniation seen.  Close clinical and radiologic follow up might be helpful.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      73 yr old male s/p right occipital intraparechymal bleed please do scan with
      and without contrast to r/o underlying lesion
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Intracranial hemorrhage.  ? of underlying lesion.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3076-4-5**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Pre and post contrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no pathological intracranial enhancement detected.  There
     is a large parieto-occipital acute hematoma with surrounding edema and mild
     mass effect on the atrium of the right lateral ventricle.  There is hemorrhage
     layering in the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 234**] of the left lateral ventricle. There is
     extensive white matter hypodensity in a periventricular distribution
     compatible with a chronic microvascular infarction.  The ventricles are
     slightly prominent as are the sulci, but unchanged in size.  There is no shift
     of normally midline structures.  The sulci adjacent to the hemorrhage are
     effaced.
     
     The osseous structures and visualized paranasal sinuses are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Unchanged appearance of right parieto-occipital hemorrhage with a small
     amount of intraventricular extension.
     
     2.  No pathological intracranial enhancement to suggest the presence of an
     underlying mass or vascular malformation though such a lesion may be missed in
     this setting.  Given the evidence for chronic microvascular disease and the
     location of the hemorrhage and amyloid angiopathy should be considered in the
     differential diagnosis for the etiology of this hemorrhage.
