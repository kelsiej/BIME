     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      81 year old woman with ampullary cancer
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      pancreatic protocol; ampullary cancer
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     CT SCAN OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS (PANCREATIC CANCER PROTOCOL INCLUDING
     MULTIPHASE SCAN INCLUDING DELAYED PHASE IMAGES THROUGH THE PANCREATIC AREA)
     
     CLINICAL DETAILS:  Ampullary cancer.  No previous imaging for comparison.
     
     FINDINGS:  The lung bases are clear.
     
     In the abdomen, the liver is normal in size.  There is moderate dilatation of
     the right and left intrahepatic biliary tree with pneumobilia mainly in the
     left lobe.  The dilated segmental branches measure up to 5-6 mm in diameter.
     The mid portion of the CBD is dilated up to 1.8 cm.  There is some fluid and
     debris in the distal portion of the CBD, which tapers in the region of the
     pancreatic head.  There is some debris within the lumen of the distal CBD and
     mild circumferential enhancement of the distal CBD.  No discrete mass lesion
     is demonstrated in the pancreatic head.  There is 6-7 mm rounded area of
     hypodensity in the posteromedial aspect of the pancreatic head adjacent to the
     CBD (series 3C, image 124).
     
     There is an internal biliary stent in situ with its superior tip lying in the
     distal CBD and its inferior tip in the second portion of duodenum.  There is,
     at most, mild uniform dilatation of the main pancreatic duct, which measures
     up to 3 mm in diameter.  3-4 mm ovoid low-density area in the posterior
     inferior pancreatic head (series 3C, image 254) is likely to represent a small
     cystic area.  The pancreas is normal in size.  It shows nodules post contrast
     enhancement.
     
     There are multiple subcentimeter calcified gallstones in the dependent portion
     of the gallbladder fundus.  The gallbladder is nondistended.
     
     In the liver, there are multifocal subcentimeter areas of nodular
     hyperattenuation in the arterial phase which vary between discrate nodular
     areas and more ill defined areas. Some of these are periductal in distribution
     and could represent areas of periductal cholangitis.  However, others are in a
     nonperiductal distribution, for example posterior subcapsular segment VII
     (series 3B, image 115),  segment II (series 3B, image 125).A few of these
     remain mildly hyperdense on the portal venous phase and could represent
     nodular hemangiomas. With this appearance the possibility of early metastatic
     disease cannot be excluded at present.
     
     Portal and hepatic veins are patent with no evidence of local vascular
     involvement.  Hepatic arterial anatomy is conventional.
                                                                 (Over)

     There are multiple mildly enlarged lymph nodes in the upper abdomen including
     one above the celiac artery axis, which measures up to 11 mm in short axis
     (series 3C, image 222).  Aortocaval lymph node just anterior to the origin of
     the hepatic artery measuring up to 11 mm in short axis.  There are multiple
     smaller lymph nodes along the proximal superior mesenteric axis, which measure
     up to 6 mm in diameter
     
     No intraabdominal ascites.
     
     The adrenal glands, spleen, kidneys are normal.  There are mildly prominent
     extrarenal pelves bilaterally, but no hydronephrosis or hydroureter.
     
     No abnormal large or small bowel loop dilatation.  Mild diverticular changes
     noted along the lower left colon.
     
     The abdominal aorta is atherosclerotic and normal in caliber.
     
     No concerning bone lesions demonstrated on bone windows settings.  A number of
     surgical clips are noted in the left hemipelvis.  Patient has had a previous
     hysterectomy.
     
     No concerning lesions demonstrated on bone window settings.  Degenerative
     changes are noted in the posterior lumbar facets.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     1.No pancreatic head lesion demonstrated on CT.
     
     2.  The biliary stent lies in good position, but there remains moderate
     intrahepatic biliary dilatation.  Correlation with liver biochemistry is
     advised to assess stent patency.
     
     3.  Multifocal subcentimeter areas of arterial hyperattenuation in the right
     and left lobe, some of which are periductal in distribution and could be
     related to intrahepatic cholangitis depending on current clinical correlation.
     Others are nonperiductal in distribution, and the possibility of early
     intrahepatic metastases cannot be excluded with this appearance.Follow
     up/correlation ,initially with ultrasound for example, may be helpful to
     characterise them further.
     Several mildly enlarged lymph nodes in the periportal and around the celiac
     axis.

Date of Birth:  [**2851-3-16**]             Sex:   F
 
Service: SURGERY
 
Allergies: 
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs
 
Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4905**] 
Chief Complaint:
Ampullary Mass
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1.  Pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy.
2.  Open cholecystectomy.
3.  Staging laparoscopy.

 
History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 4503**] is an 81-year-old woman who lost 
weight, got jaundiced, felt bad, apparently fell and was 
admitted 
through [**Hospital6 **] back in [**2932-7-18**] for 
evaluation. She was profoundly jaundiced, and an ERCP was 
necessary to stent a distal biliary stricture in the 
periampullary area. Apparently, her bilirubin got up in the 
range of 12 mg per deciliter. She had a 35-pound weight loss 
over the past 2 months. Her periampullary mass was biopsied, 
negative. Her jaundice has since fully resolved. 

A CT scan later showed a 6-7 mm mass at the pancreatic head 
adjacent to the 
CBD (1.8 mm).  

 
Past Medical History:
Her past surgical history is significant for total abdominal 
hysterectomy and an appendectomy remotely. From a medical 
standpoint, she has diet-controlled diabetes, which has gotten a 

lot better since she has lost weight. She has mild hypertension 
and she had uterine cancer, prompting the hysterectomy eight 
years ago. 

 

 
Social History:
She stopped smoking over 40 years ago and does not 
drink alcohol. 
 

 
Physical Exam:
On exam she is non-distressed, alert and 
oriented. She is not jaundiced. Her neck 
is supple with a midline trachea, and no jugular venous 
distention or lymphadenopathy. Her chest is clear on 
auscultation. Breast exam was not performed. Her cardiac rate 
and rhythm is normal. Her abdomen shows lower, old, well-healed 
incisions. The upper abdomen is without incisions. Otherwise, 
the belly has no masses or hepatosplenomegaly. Rectal exam is 
guaiac negative, and there are no masses. She has no hernias.  
Pelvic exam was deferred. Her extremities are normal with full 
range of motion and symmetrical pulses though she does have 1+ 
pitting edema bilaterally at the ankles. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Patient Expired POD 36

The patient was admitted for surgery-day-admission.  The patient 
tolerated the surgery and was admitted to the surgical intensive 
care unit and had a complicated stay.  She had acute MI 
(NSTEMI), alterned mental status, pneumonia with acute 
respiratoy failure, new onset of Afib, and became septic.  
Several consult teams became involved in her care including 
Cardiology, Pulmonology, and Infectious Disease.  Multiple 
procedures where done inorder to maximize her recovery, 
including tracheostomy, central line placements, chest tubes, 
and VATS.  She was placed on antibiotics such as Vancomycin, 
Levofloxacin, Flagyl, Zosyn, Meropenum, and Ambisone.  She was 
transfused several times with pRBC's.  All efforts were made to 
resusitate the patient.  However, the patients WBC remained 
elevated in the 20,000's (although seldomly febrile) and she 
required pressors to maintain the BP.  She continued to 
detiorate and expired on POD 36.

     INDICATION:  Right central venous line placement.
     
     CHEST, ONE VIEW:  A right-sided IJ central venous line is seen terminating in
     the proximal right atrium.  It can be retracted approximately 1 cm.
     Nasogastric tube is seen terminating in the stomach.  Another wire is seen
     approaching the midline of the abdomen from the inferior aspect, is of
     uncertain significance.  The lungs are clear, and no pneumothorax is
     identified on this supine view.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
     unremarkable.  The hila appear vaguely full, though there is no evidence of
     cardiac failure.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful central venous line placement.  Line can be retracted
     approximately 1 cm.  This was discussed with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1473**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2330**], the medical

     COMPARISON:  [**2932-9-11**] at 20:37.
     
     FINDINGS:
     Compared to the prior study, there is paracentral prominence with poorly
     defined distended pulmonary vessels with bilateral effusions.  The pattern is
     consistent with CHF and pulmonary edema especially considering the symmetry
     and rapid progression.  Lines and tubes remain in place and there is no PTX.

     FINDINGS:
     
     The tip of the right Swan-Ganz catheter is now in the right pulmonary outflow
     tract.  ETT remains in place and the NGT tip is not seen cut off from the
     field of view.  Increasing hazy density projects over the right lung base
     suggesting worsening right pleural effusion.  A left effusion remains.  There
     is a more focal density at the right upper lobe abutting the minor fissure. No
     air bronchograms are visualized within but this could be a developing
     pneumonia.  There is no PTX and no other interval changes.

     COMMENTS: A single portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed.
     
     Tip of an endotracheal tube is located 4 cm above the level of the carina.  A
     right-sided Swan-Ganz catheter overlies the region of the right descending
     pulmonary artery with its tip in a slightly distal position.  No interval
     change in a large right-sided pleural effusion is noted.  No pneumothorax is
     demonstrated. There is worsening of a moderate left pleural effusion.  The
     pulmonary vasculature is less prominent reflecting improvement of mild
     pulmonary edema. Left retrocardiac heterogeneous opacity is unchanged and
     could represent atelectasis or developing pneumonia, alone or in combination.
     The tip of a nasogastric tube is seen in the body of the stomach.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Stable large right pleural effusion with worsening left effusion.
     2.  Left retrocardiac consolidation, which could be atelectasis and/or
     developing pneumonia.
     3.  No pneumothorax.

     INDICATION:  81-year-old female status post Whipple procedure and re-
     positioning of endotracheal tube.
     
     COMMENTS:  A single portable semi-upright view of the chest was reviewed and
     compared with AP chest radiographs from [**2932-9-18**].
     
     An endotracheal tube is seen with its tip located 5 cm above the level of the
     carina.  The tip of the nasogastric tube is within the body of the stomach.  A
     right IJ catheter projects over the cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax is
     identified.  Moderate congestive heart failure is unchanged.  There has been
     interval increase in right lobe diffuse patchy opacity, which may reflect
     developing pneumonia superimposed over moderate pulmonary edema.  Moderate
     bilateral pleural effusions have increased slightly in size.  The
     cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Moderate interstitial pulmonary edema with likely development of
     superimposed right multifocal pneumonia.  No evidence of pneumothorax.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  81-year-old female status post Whipple procedure, now extubated.
     Assess for infiltrates.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Comparison is made to serial chest radiographs from [**2932-9-15**] to the most recent of [**2932-8-21**].
     
     TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  A single AP supine chest radiograph was reviewed.  The
     tip of a right IJ venous catheter overlies the distal SVC.  There has been
     interval removal of an endotracheal and nasogastric tube.  No pneumothorax is
     identified.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
     unchanged.  Bilateral pleural effusions are stable.  Interval development of a
     focal area of right upper lobe opacification is concerning for developing
     pneumonia.  There is moderate left convex scoliosis.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Right upper lobe focal consolidation concerning for developing pneumonia.
     2.  No pneumothorax.
     3.  Stable moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
     
     A page was sent to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1194**] on the date of study to discuss these findings.

     COMPARISON:  [**2932-9-23**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The right internal jugular central venous line is again noted, tip
     overlying the SVC.  Heart size and mediastinal contours are stable.  There is
     increasing density silhouetting the right heart border within the lungs,
     suggestive of worsening right middle lobe pneumonia.  Additionally, there is
     increasing rounded opacity in the right upper lobe, with right upper lobe
     volume loss.  Layering bilateral pleural effusions are noted, tracking into
     the major fissure on the right.  Patchy opacities are noted in the left
     perihilar and upper lung regions as well.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Worsening parenchymal consolidation in the right middle lobe as
     well as in the left upper and hilar regions.  This is suggestive of worsening
     pneumonia.  Chest CT may be helpful in further evaluation.  Findings discussed
     with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3793**] [**Name (STitle) 3794**] in the evening of [**2932-9-25**].

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  81-year-old woman with history of Whipple procedure, question
     pneumonia with cavitations.
     
     There are no prior CT studies available for comparison.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT scanning of the chest was performed without
     administration of intravenous contrast.
     
     FINDINGS:  There are large bilateral pleural effusions.  There are associated
     left lower lobe collapse and dependent compressive atelectatic changes.  There
     are also airspace consolidations, most pronounced within the right upper lobe
     and to a lesser degree in the right middle lobe with air bronchograms most
     consistent with pneumonia.  Patchy airspace disease is also appreciated in the
     left upper lobe.  There is no evidence of cavitation.  Note is made of a small
     pericardial effusion.  Coronary artery calcifications are noted.  No
     pathologically enlarged areas of adenopathy are appreciated.  A right internal
     central venous catheter is noted with the tip terminating in the distal SVC.
     
     The visualized portions of the abdomen are remarkable for surgical changes
     consistent with history of Whipple.  There is expected pneumobilia.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Large bilateral pleural effusions with associated left lower lobe
     collapse.
     
     2.  Multifocal airspace consolidations most pronounced in the right upper lobe
     and right middle lobe with air bronchograms most consistent with pneumonia. 
     There is no evidence of cavitation.

     INDICATION:  Status post Whipple procedure, now extubated.  Placement of
     central venous line.  Check position.
     
     FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
     supine position.  Comparison is made with a similar preceding examination of
     [**2932-9-25**].  An additional right subclavian central venous line has now
     been placed seen to terminate overlying the SVC at the level of the carina. 
     There is no pneumothorax or any other placement related complication.  There
     is, however,  evidence of bilateral parenchymal densities including the right
     apical area and pleural effusions obliterate the lateral pleural sinuses. 
     Pre-existing right internal jugular vein approach central venous line remains
     in unchanged position.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of additional right subclavian approach
     central venous line.

     HISTORY:  Chest dart placement for pneumothorax.
     
     CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE SUPINE VIEW.
     
     Compared with earlier the same day, a tube now overlies the upper lung,
     consistent with the history of chest dart placement.  An additional larger
     caliber tube overlies the upper right chest wall, of uncertain significance.
     There has been partial reexpansion of the right lung, though a large right
     apical pneumothorax remains present.  The left lung is unchanged, with a

     CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE SUPINE VIEW.
     
     Compared with earlier the same day, a tube now overlies the upper lung,
     consistent with the history of chest dart placement.  An additional larger
     caliber tube overlies the upper right chest wall, of uncertain significance.
     There has been partial reexpansion of the right lung, though a large right
     apical pneumothorax remains present.  The left lung is unchanged, with a
     relatively large layering effusion and underlying collapse and/or
     consolidation. Probable small right pleural effusion and continued right lung
     atelectasis.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Slight improvement in the large right apical pneumothorax status

     HISTORY:  Status post right thoracentesis for effusion, assess for
     pneumothorax.
     
     CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE SUPINE VIEW.
     
     There is a large right-sided pneumothorax, new compared to 1 day earlier.  It
     is collapsed and retracted around the hilum, with prominent focal nodular
     densities, which could represent either pulmonary masses or areas of
     collapse and/or consolidation.  There is a small right pleural effusion.  On
     the left, there is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and a small-
     to- moderate left pleural effusion.  There is pleural thickening and/or fluid
     at the left lung apex.
     
     A right IJ central line is present, tip over lower SVC.  Allowing for the
     patient's left convex scoliosis, I doubt significant mediastinal shift,
     although the trachea may be slightly displaced to the right.
     
     Findings discussed with the ordering physician Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3798**] on the day of

     Comparison is made to the prior exam of the same day at 5:14 hours.
     
     FINDINGS:  Right pleural drainage catheter and right subclavian central venous
     line are in stable position.  Newly inserted NG tube twists in the stomach but
     heads caudad and exits the field of view.  Some contrast is noted within the
     fundus of the stomach.  There is a small apical hydropneumothorax, improved
     since previous exam.  There is persistent large left pleural effusion but mild
     improvement in left-sided pulmonary vascular congestion.  Right upper lobe
     patchy consolidation remains.  A small component of pneumothorax is also seen
     at the right base outlining the diaphragm.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Improvement to small apical hydropneumothorax.  Slight component of right
     basilar pneumothorax noted on the current exam, likely due to change in
     positioning.
     2) Newly inserted NG tube which courses through the stomach and exits the

     HISTORY:  Treated for pneumothorax.  Air leak.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**9-28**], 5:16 a.m.
     
     Previous moderate-sized right pneumothorax is almost entirely resolved. 
     Right-sided pleural catheter may be sharply folded.  Clinical evaluation is
     warranted.
     
     Large region of consolidation in the apex of the right lung persists,
     progressively increasing in size since the end of August.  Moderate-to-large
     left pleural effusion and mild pulmonary edema have increased since [**9-28**].  Heart size is top normal.  Right subclavian line projects over the
     expected course to the superior cavoatrial junction.

     INDICATION:  Whipple procedure status post right thoracostomy for
     pneumothorax.
     
     Comparison is made to the prior exam of the same day at 5:14 hours.
     
     FINDINGS:  Right pleural drainage catheter and right subclavian central venous
     line are in stable position.  Newly inserted NG tube twists in the stomach but
     heads caudad and exits the field of view.  Some contrast is noted within the
     fundus of the stomach.  There is a small apical hydropneumothorax, improved
     since previous exam.  There is persistent large left pleural effusion but mild
     improvement in left-sided pulmonary vascular congestion.  Right upper lobe
     patchy consolidation remains.  A small component of pneumothorax is also seen
     at the right base outlining the diaphragm.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Improvement to small apical hydropneumothorax.  Slight component of right
     basilar pneumothorax noted on the current exam, likely due to change in
     positioning.
     2) Newly inserted NG tube which courses through the stomach and exits the
     field of view.

     HISTORY:  Right thoracostomy tube for pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**9-29**] and 13:
     
     Right pleural catheter has reconfigured itself but no right pneumothorax or
     pleural effusion has recurred.  Edema has virtually cleared from the right
     lung and improved on the left, revealing what appear to be many small lung
     nodules that were not present 3 weeks ago suggesting disseminated sepsis.
     
     Heart is normal in size and mediastinum is midline.  Tip of the ET tube just
     above the thoracic inlet is 8 cm from the carina, 3 cm above optimal
     placement.  Swan-Ganz catheter tip projects over the origin of the right upper
     lobe pulmonary artery and should be examined to exclude inadvertent wedge
     postionning. Nasogastric tube and feeding tube both pass into the stomach and
     out of view. There is no appreciable pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.
     
     Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3807**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3808**] and I discussed these findings at the time of dictation.

     Right pleural drain is still in place.  There is no right pneumothorax or
     appreciable pleural effusion.  Mild pulmonary edema is returning.  Left
     hemithorax is substantially more opacified probably due to increasing left
     pleural effusion and worsening asymmetric edema which obscures lung nodules
     seen yesterday with transient clearing of edema.  Swan-Ganz catheter and the
     ET tube are in standard placements respectively.  Feeding tube and nasogastric
     tube pass below the upper stomach and out of view.

     INDICATION:  Status post Whipple procedure.
     
     Comparison is made to the previous examination of [**2932-10-2**].
     
     FINDINGS:  Swan-Ganz catheter has its tip in the distal right main pulmonary
     artery.  Two NG tubes are noted, one with tip in the stomach and another
     coursing through the stomach and exiting field of view.  ET tube is just below
     the thoracic inlet.  Right pleural drainage catheter is in relatively stable
     position.
     
     The cardiomediastinal borders are unchanged.  There is a small left pleural
     effusion, now seen dependently on upright position.  There is relative
     increased opacity within the right upper lobe, and continued diffuse increased
     opacity in the left lung, obscuring previously noted nodules.  A probable skin
     fold is seen marginating the left lateral chest wall, although pneumothorax
     cannot entirely be excluded.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Slightly high positioning of ET tube.
     
     2.  Slight worsened right upper lobe opacity, and persistent asymmetric left
     lung pulmonary edema.  No change in left pleural effusion.
     
     3.  Probable left-sided skin fold along the lateral chest wall, although a
     pneumothorax cannot entirely be excluded.  Repeat examination is recommended.

     HISTORY:  Check left chest tube.
     
     FINDINGS:  The left chest tube port is still in the soft tissues.  There is a
     left pleural effusion layering posteriorly.  The endotracheal tube tip is 4 cm
     above the carina.  The NG tube and feeding tube tips are off the film, least
     in the stomach.  There is hazy opacity at the right base, likely due to
     pleural effusion.  An underlying infiltrate and volume loss cannot be
     excluded.  There has been interval progression of an alveolar infiltrate in
     bilateral upper lobes, left greater than right.  The vasculature is in
     indistinct.  The overall impression is that of CHF.  An underlying infectious
     infiltrate cannot be excluded.  There is no significant change in the small
     bore right chest tube.

     HISTORY:  Bilateral chest tubes.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**10-4**] and [**10-5**]:
     
     Very small left apical pneumothorax persists despite the left pleural tube
     with side port remains extrathoracic.  Small left pleural effusion may be
     present layering posteriorly.  Moderately severe pulmonary edema is present
     distributed asymmetrically, sparing the right upper lobe.  Left upper lobe
     consolidation is unchanged.  Tip of the endotracheal tube is at the thoracic
     inlet.  Feeding tube and a second nasogastric tube pass below the diaphragm
     and out of view.  Tip of the right subclavian line projects over the SVC. 
     Leftward mediastinal shift is unchanged.  On the right, there is a persistent
     small pleural effusion.  Small-bore pleural catheter hugs the right chest
     wall.  Anterior pneumothorax could be present but there is no indication of a
     large collection of pleural air.
     
     Heart is normal size.

     SUPINE AP VIEW OF THE ABDOMEN:  Feeding tube is again identified with tip in
     the small bowel.  Catheter is again identified overlying the pelvis, in
     unchanged position, again likely representing a drainage catheter.  Surgical
     clips are again noted within the pelvis.  Gas is noted within the stomach.
     Otherwise, there is a relative paucity of gas within the abdomen.  No definite
     evidence of free intraperitoneal air.  The osseous structures are unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Relative paucity of gas within the abdomen, which is a non-
     specific findings and may represent decompressed bowel loops; however, fluid-
     filled loops of bowel cannot be fully excluded.

     HISTORY:  81-year-old woman S/P Whipple, with pleural effusions.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT scan through the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with
     oral and intravenous contrast.  Comparison is made with previous study from
     [**2932-10-6**].
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     CT TORSO:  There are bilateral pleural effusions that have decreased in
     size especially in the right hemithorax. Mild atelectasis is present in the
     inferior left lobe.  Airspace consolidation involves both lower lobes, and
     left upper lobe significantly increased/new since the prior study. The
     consolidation in the right upper lobe is less apparent in the current exam.
     Endotracheal tube. A right internal central venous catheter is noted with the
     tip in the distal SVC. Left-sided chest tube.
     
     CT ABDOMEN:  The liver, spleen, adrenals, both kidneys are unremarkable.
     Surgical changes consistent with history of Whipple procedure.  No obvious
     masses are seen indicating for recurrence.  The remaining body and tail of the
     pancreas is unremarkable. There is slight prominence of the CBD. Pneumobilia
     in the left lobe of the liver.  There is no free fluid or free air within the
     abdomen. There are no signs of bowel obstruction.  Surgical clips within the
     abdomen. Feeding tube is identified with tip in the jejunum.  A drainage
     catheter is seen within the pelvis.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Multifocal airspace consolidation with air bronchograms consistent with
     pneumonia that are more pronounced  than on the previous study.  The
     consolidation in the right upper lobe, however, is no longer seen in the
     current exam. Bilateral pleural effusions that have decreased in size.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      with chest tubes

     INDICATION:  81-year-old woman status post Whipple, assess chest tube.
     
     COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated [**2932-10-6**].
     
     SINGLE PORTABLE AP SEMI-UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The endotracheal tube is at
     the thoracic inlet, approximately 6.6 cm above the carina.  The right
     subclavian central venous line tip is in the central superior vena cava.  The
     nasogastric tube as well as the feeding tube tip are not visualized, but are
     below the diaphragm.  Again seen is a left-sided chest tube with the tip over
     the upper lung zone, the side port continues to be in the soft tissues of the
     chest wall.  A small bore right pleural catheter is in similar position to the
     prior exam.  There is a persistent small left apical pneumothorax.  There has
     been interval improvement in the left upper lobe consolidation, though there
     continues to be widespread alveolar opacification.  There is a small left-
     sided pleural effusion.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Clearing pneumonia in the left upper lobe.  However, there
     continue to be bilateral asymmetric alveolar opacities consistent with
     asymmetric edema or multifocal pneumonia.
     2.  Persistent small left apical pneumothorax.  Left-sided chest tube with
     side port persistently in the soft tissues of the left chest wall.

     recently [**10-9**]:
     
     No pneumothorax is seen.  Small left pleural effusion, with an apical
     component due to supine positioning has increased.  Widespread pulmonary
     opacification, probably a combination of edema and pneumonia, has been stable
     over 24 hours, progressed in the right lung since [**10-7**].  Tracheostomy
     tube, right subclavian line, and nasogastric drain are in standard placements.
     A feeding tube passes below the mid stomach and out of view.

     Tracheostomy tube, central venous catheter, feeding tube, and nasogastric tube

     Overall, slight worsening of multifocal alveolar opacities, most likely due to

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      please inject Dophoff with contrast and evaluate flow of contrast to rule out 
      obstruction
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Status post pylorus-sparing Whipple surgery with tube feed material
     being suctioned from the oral gastric tube.  Evaluate flow of contrast to
     determine presence of obstruction.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  Preliminary scout view of the abdomen demonstrates
     multiple surgical clips within the pelvis as well as a feeding tube passing
     through the stomach, beyond the pylorus and into the small bowel.
     Approximately 300 cc of thin barium was injected through the patient's feeding
     tube which demonstrated free flow of contrast from the jejunum and was noted
     to move distally within the efferent loop.  Additionally, there was free
     reflux of contrast retrograde into the stomach. Free gastroesophageal reflux
     was also demonstrated to the level of the proximal esophagus.  Contrast was
     also noted to opacify the afferent jejunal limb as well as the biliary
     system through a patent hepaticojejunostomy site. The opacified biliary system
     appeared normal in caliber.  The small bowel appeared normal in caliber and
     mucosal pattern. There was no evidence of small-bowel obstruction. At the
     completion of the examination, contrast is noted to reach the mid jejunum.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Status post Whipple's surgery with reflux of contrast retrograde from the
     efferent jejunal limb and into the stomach. Free gastroesophageal reflux was
     seen.
     2.  Opacification of both the efferent and afferent jejunal limbs demonstrated
     no evidence of small-bowel obstruction or mucosal abnormality.
     3.  Opacification of the biliary system via the hepaticojejunostomy
     anastomosis demonstrated no evidence of biliary dilatation.
     
     These findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2988**] the completion of the
     examination on [**2932-10-13**].  A delayed KUB can be obtained to evaluate for passage
     of contrast into the colon.

     TECHNIQUE:  A single portable AP supine abdominal radiograph was obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is a nasointestinal tube in stable position with its distal
     tip likely within the jejunum.  Contrast from the prior day's fluoroscopy
     study has now freely passed through the small bowel and is seen to fill the
     colon and rectum.  Small and large bowel are of normal caliber.  There is no

     Single portable AP supine chest radiograph is reviewed and compared to the
     prior study of [**2932-10-14**].  There is a new left-sided Swan-Ganz
     catheter with its tip terminating in the right main pulmonary artery.  There
     is no pneumothorax.  Tracheostomy is still in place.  Feeding and nasogastric
     tube are in unchanged position.  There is continued moderate pulmonary edema
     with superimposed persistent bilateral focal opacities.  There is a small
     right pleural effusion.  There is mild cardiomegaly.  Contrast is again seen
     in the colon.

     INDICATION:  81-year-old female with ampullary cancer status post Whipple
     procedure, presenting with bilateral pleural effusions.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Comparison is made to [**2932-10-7**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  64-MDCT axial images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were
     obtained with oral contrast only.  IV contrast was not administered due to the
     patient's high creatinine.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is a tracheostomy tube, which
     appears to be in good position.  There is a left subclavian Swan-Ganz catheter
     with the tip in the right main pulmonary artery.  There are severe coronary
     artery calcifications.  There are no significant axillary lymph nodes.  There
     are small mediastinal lymph nodes that do not meet CT criteria for pathology
     and are unchanged when compared to the prior study.  The study of the chest is
     slightly limited due to motion.  There are bilateral pleural effusions (right
     greater than left).  The right pleural effusion is very large and increased
     when compared to the prior study.  There are associated atelectasis.  There
     are also patchy opacities throughout the lung fields, which could represent
     atelectasis but cannot rule out a superimposed infectious process.  The
     pleural effusions' density is 10 Hounsfield units.  There is an NG tube with
     the tip in the body of the stomach.  There is also another NJ tube with the
     tip in proximal small bowel.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH ORAL CONTRAST ONLY:  The patient is status post Whipple
     procedure. There is density within the intrahepatic bile ducts, which is
     unchanged when compared to prior study.  The liver surface is slightly
     irregular, but there are no focal lesions with the limitation of this
     noncontrast scan.  With the limitation of this noncontrast scan, the spleen,
     kidneys and adrenal glands are unremarkable.  The patient is status post
     Whipple procedure.  The stomach is dilated suggesting gastroparesis. However,
     there is progression of contrast through the loops of small bowel without
     obvious transition point.  The study of the lower abdomen and pelvis is
     limited due to streak artifact coming from dense barium present in the colon
     from prior upper GI study.  There is moderate amount of free fluid in the
     abdomen and in the pelvis.  The aorta is very calcified.  The patient is
     status post Whipple procedure.  There is stranding of the mesentery, which is
     probably due to postoperative changes.
                                                                 (Over)
