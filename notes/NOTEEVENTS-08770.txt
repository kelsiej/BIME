History of Present Illness:
This a [**Age over 90 **]y/o female with a history of COPD, hypertension, 
gastroespohageal reflux who presented with shortness of breath 
and dyspnea on exertion X 3 days.
Per nursing home records, the patient was reported to have had 
10cc of hemoptysis. O2 sat was 92%. Patient reports substernal 
chest pain radiating to the back, lasting seconds.  By history 
the pain is pleuritic, because coughing makes it worse.
.  
On presentation peak flow was 140; improved to 240 after 1st neb 
in the ED. Chest X-ray  showed multilobular consolidation. CT-A 
showed no PE or obstructive bronchial lesion, but central 
bilateral consolidation secondary to pneumonia and CHF was 
noted. An EKG showed TWI in I and avL, and in V4-V6, unchanged 
from previous.  Trop was 0.10 in the setting of renal 
insufficiency.

Chest X-ray [**3495-10-11**]
1. Multilobar consolidation, which could reflect asymmetrical 
edema and/or multilobar pneumonia. A postobstructive process in 
the right middle lobe cannot be excluded. By report, the patient 
is scheduled to undergo CTA, which will be helpful for more 
complete characterization of these findings.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
.
CT-A [**3495-10-11**]
1. No parenchymal mass lesion or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. No 
acute pulmonary embolus.

2. Central bilateral consolidation mainly along the inferior 
hilar regions with patchy areas of consolidation in the upper 
and lower lobes. Enlargement of the central arterial pulmonary 
vasculature and mild cardiac enlargement suggestive of 
background pulmonary hypertension. Small bibasilar pleural 
effusions. These findings may all be due to cardiac failure with 
pulmonary hypertension. Infective consolidation should be also 
considered depending on the current clinical correlation. 
Interval followup post-treatment initially with chest x-ray is 
advised.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
1. Pneumonia
The patient was initially maintained on ceftriaxone and 
azithromycin for community acquired pneumonia.  Because the 
patient came from rehabilitation, the decision was made to 
change the antibiotic coverage to Levaquin. Her treatment also 
consisted of Q2 nebulizer treatments, oxygen and her home dose 
of prednisone.  On the morning of HD #2, the patient's course 
was complicated by transient desaturation to 88% on 6L NC and a 
shovel mask.  On exam the patient had rhonchorous breath sounds, 
difficulty mobilizing her secretions. O2 sats improved with 
coughing to 91%.  Despite improvement in her O2 sats, the 
patient continued to have labored breathing.  She received 10 of 
IV lasix and nebulizer treatments.  O2sats improved to 95-99%  
on the same amount of O2.  Respiratory therapy recommmended 
humidified air to help loosen the secretions.   Patient course 
deteriorated on the morning of HD #3.  02sats were initially 
stable in the 90s. The patient became tachypneic breathing at an 
average rate of 30. Antibiotic coverage was changed to 
Ceftazadine because prelim sputum cultures grew gram negative 
rods. Despite lasix, morphine and frequent nebulizer treatments, 
patient's O2sats decreased to 86% on 6LNC and 100%NRB. The 
decision was made to transfer her to the FICU for further 
management.
.
In the FICU, the pt continued to desaturate to the 80s on NC and 
FM. She had one episode of desaturation to the 80s which did not 
resolve after one minute. CXR showed mucus plugging of the 
entire left lung. Pt was placed on her right side and had 
rigorous chest PT, and saturations improved to low 90s. Family 
was called in. After several days of pt's respiratory status not 
improving, pt's status was discussed with family, who decided to 
make her CMO. Pt was placed on morphine gtt and died on [**3495-10-21**] 
am surrounded by her family.
.  
2. Leukocytosis:
Pt's leukocytosis was likely [**12-19**] to pneumonia and UTI. Pt was 
afebrile throughout admission. Pt was placed on levaquin, and 
blood cultures were negative.
.  
3. Hemoptysis:
Pt had episodes of hemoptysis on the floor, but not in the FICU. 
This was likely [**12-19**] pneumonia. Pt's Hct stayed stable, and stool 
was guaiac negative.
.  
4. Chest pain:
Pt had episodes of fleeting, pleuritic chest pain on the floor, 
with Trop 0.10, which was likely due to renal insufficiency. The 
family and patient agreed not to have any intervention for any 
possible cardiac issues.
.  
5. Acute renal failure:
Pt's acute renal failure was likely due to a dye load with the 
CT. Cr improved with fluids.
.  
6. HTN: 
Pt was continued on Isordil and norvasc.
.  
7. CHF:
Pt had evidence of CHF on CXR, with trace edema on the posterior 
aspect of her legs.  She was continued on daily lasix prn.

     This is a portable upright chest dated [**3495-10-11**], with clinical
     indication of worsening shortness of breath for 2 days.  Hemoptysis and
     hypoxia.
     
     The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but is difficult to fully assess due to
     obscuration of the right heart border.  Pulmonary vascularity is slightly
     engorged and there is perihilar haziness. There are multifocal areas of
     consolidation present in the lower lobes, right greater than left, and there
     is a more confluent opacity in the right perihilar region.
     Collapse/consolidation of right middle lobe is also noted. There are bilateral
     pleural effusions, moderate on the right and small on the left.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Multilobar consolidation, which could reflect asymmetrical edema and/or
     multilobar pneumonia. A postobstructive process in the right middle lobe
     cannot be excluded. By report, the patient is scheduled to undergo CTA, which
     will be helpful for more complete characterization of these findings.
     2. Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.

     Comparison is made to previous chest radiograph.
     
     CT THORACIC ANGIOGRAM:
     
     No acute pulmonary embolus.  Central arterial pulmonary vasculature is
     slightly dilated with the main pulmonary artery measuring up to 3.3 cm
     transverse and the right main pulmonary artery measuring up to 2.9 cm
     transverse in its mid portion.  These findings are suggestive of background
     pulmonary hypertension, the heart size is mildly enlarged.  Three-vessel
     coronary artery calcification noted on the un-enhanced CT.
     
     Small bibasilar pleural effusions.  Central airspace consolidation mainly in
     the inferior right and left hilar regions.  Minor patchy areas of
     consolidation in the right upper and left upper lobes and partial atelectasis
     of the left lower lobe.  These appearances may be all or in part due to
     congestive cardiac failure with associated consolidation in the setting of
     cardiac failure. Concurrent element of infective consolidation should be
     considered clinically.
     
     The trachea and main central airways are patent, no evidence of central
      endobronchial or mass lesion on the current CT or mediastinal
     lymphadenopathy.
     Incidental note is made of a 1.2-cm ovoid hypodensity in the inferior portion
     of the right thyroid lobe that may represent a colloid cyst or hypoattenuating
     nodule.  This is unlikely to be clinically significant
     
     In the included portion of the upper abdomen, part of a fluid- attenuating
     cyst towards the posterior superior left upper pole measuring at least 3 cm in
     size with some thin marginal calcification along its posterior aspect.  This
     is not fully included on preceding CT and could be correlated at some point
     with ultrasound.  The adrenal glands appear normal.

     PORTABLE ERECT AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There has been interval complete
     opacification of the left hemithorax.  There is slight shift of the

     concerning for interval mucous plugging of the bronchus, and/or collapse of

She was ordered for NIV but became rather verbally combative in resisting this as well as oxygen @ times. SHe seemed lucid and appropriate when she stated she knew refusal might mean she would not continue to live. Howver, when family arrived she was much calmer and accepted intervention. Currently pt is on NRM, NIV standby
