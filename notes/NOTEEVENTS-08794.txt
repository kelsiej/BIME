Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 597**] 
Chief Complaint:
 tonic-clonic seizure
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none
 
History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 78 year old man with a seizure disorder who 
presented with generalized clonic-tonic seizure. 
*
He underwent colonoscopy yesterday morning, undergoing a prep of 
2 phosphosoda and 2 dulcolax with plenty of water, bouillon and 
sprite ingested in between. The colonoscopy went well but he was 
very tired afterwards and fell asleep early, missing his 7pm 
dose of keppra. At 8pm, his wife, who was briefly asleep in bed, 
awoke next to him observing that his head was jerking back and 
forth and he was making guttural sounds. He had bitten his 
tongue. She is not certain what the rest of the extremities were 
doing. The activity lasted about 15 seconds. He was described as 
being post-ictal and hard to wake up by EMS notes. 
*
At [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 250**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] a CT head was done and was reportedly negative. His 
sodium was measured at 120. He was given 2mg ativan for unclear 
reasons but it was noted that he was very combative. He was 
transferred to [**Hospital1 83**] for further care at his wife's request. 
While here in the ED he has been very combative and required 1mg 
ativan x 2 and 2.5mg haldol x 2. 
*
Of note, he has had seizure disorder dating back to 21 years 
prior which presented as a generalized seizure. He apparently 
had another ""small one"" 6 months later after he was being taken 
off dilantin and has not had any generalized seizures since. He 
does however now have brief episodes of staring and 
unresponsiveness that are thought to be complex partial 
seizures. An EEG in [**3395**] shows bilateral temporal slowing with 
some bursts of slowing seen. He had been on dilantin for many 
years but his gait was thought to be wobbly and he started a 
transition to keppra with a taper of dilantin, which was 
discontinued completely on [**3402-3-31**]. Since then he has been doing 
well, had a physical in April with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at which it was 
mentioned""his electrolytes were low"" and HCTZ was cut in half to 
12.5mg daily.

Radiologic Studies: 
-------------------
Head CT- 
1. No intracranial hemorrhage. 
2. Evidence of prior infarcts as described above to further 
evaluate for an acute infarct, MRI is more sensitive.
3. Diffuse paranasal sinus opacification.
*
CXR- Mild congestive heart failure. No focal opacity to suggest 
consolidation

MRI-MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**3402-4-26**] 5:05 PM
IMPRESSION: Atrophy and chronic infarcts as described. Sinus 
disease including the mastoid sinus. No evidence of acute 
infarct, mass effect, or hemorrhage.
Negative MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 345**]. A reading was called on 
this report to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. A preliminary report to this effect 
was provided by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12242**] and [**Doctor Last Name 12243**].

CHEST (LAT DECUB ONLY)  [**3402-4-26**] 10:37 AM
FINDINGS: On decubitus view, there is no evidence of layering 
effusion. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes remain stable. The 
retrocardiac opacity probably relates to the known hiatal 
hernia.

Video Swallow: IMPRESSION: Penetration, but no aspiration with 
nectar consistency. Aspiration demonstrated with thin liquids 
with clearance after spontaneous or cued cough. 

EEG:
IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the focal left anterior 

quadrant delta slowing and due to the generalized slowing and 
background 
disorganization. The last two abnormalities signify a widespread 

encephalopathy. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and 
infection are 
among the most common causes. The faster activity suggests a 
medication 
effect. Focal left anterior quadrant slowing raises concern for 
a focal 
subcortical abnormality. Anatomic correlation would be of 
interest if 
clinically indicated. There were no epileptiform features. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
78 year old man with epilepsy with prolonged post-ictal 
agitation and lethargy. A brief [**Hospital 5796**] hospital course is 
outlined below. 

1) Seizure: The patient had a witnessed seizure and a history of 
seizures. This was felt to be most likely precipitated by 
dehydration from the colonoscopy prep. Normally on Keppra but he 
may have missed a dose. CT negative for intracranial process and 
EEG negative on admission for continued seizure. His keppra was 
continued, and his neurologist was contacted who suggested not 
restarting dilantin due to profound ataxia he had experienced on 
dilantin previously. No further seizure activity since 
admission. 

2) Altered Mental Status: Initially when he was admitted to the 
ICU he was over-sedated and this was felt secondary to recieving 
ativan and haldol in the ED. He subsequently cleared from this 
sedation, but then became agitated the following night, with 
associated visual hallucinations and attempts to climb out of 
bed. It was felt that this was possibly related to ETOH 
withdrawl vs occult infection vs medication related (quinidine). 
His mental status did not improve following zyprexa or haldol 
treatment. Therefore he was started emperically on amoxicillin 
for sinusitis). ETOH history revealed that he only drinks 1 
glass of wine per day, which would make ETOH withdrawl less 
likely. His quinidine was held for 24 hours but he was found to 
have premature atrial contractions and no overt improvement in 
mental status, so this was restarted. Neurology reexamined the 
patient and felt that there was still some persistent weakness 
on his right side, so an MRI was obtained to rule out stroke 
which showed no acute lesion explaining these findings. Further 
benzodiazepines were held and his mental status gradually 
improved through the time of discharge.

3) hyponatremia: His serum Osm low consistent with hypo-osmolar 
hyponatremia. Likely secondary to volume depletion, since 
clinical exam suggested hypovolemia. Also, urine Na >20, 
suggesting renal loss, likely from HCTZ diuresis. He was treated 
with free water restriction and volume repletion, and the HCTZ 
was stopped. [**Last Name (un) 1737**] stim responder suggesting against adrenal 
insufficiency as etiology. Following these interventions his Na 
returned to above 136. 

4) Left Shift/Bandemia: He initially presented with 9% bands on 
cbc/diff. Suspected response to recent seizure activity. U/A had 
RBC and occ bacteria, but negative nitrite. His Urine Cx was 
negative and CXR was negative for infiltrate. Initially held off 
on antibiotics since he was afebrile and well-appearing. However 
he subsequently developed delirium which was felt possibly 
secondary to an infectious source. Sinus CT was reviewed and 
showed diffuse paranasal opacifiation, therefore he was started 
empirically on a course of amoxicilin for sinusitis. 

5) Elevated CK: The patient had a high CK and CK-MB with flat 
troponin. Suspected secondary to seizure. He had no associated 
chest pain or EKG changes. He was continued on his medical 
regimen of zocor, norvasc and the [**Last Name (un) 367**] was restarted at 
discharge.

6) elevated blood sugar: He was continued on sliding scale 
insulin.
 
7) Platelets - His paltelets dropped by 50% on [**4-26**] and a 
heparin dependent antibody test was sent, which was cancelled 
after his platelet level rebounded. Heparin flushes were 
stopped, and DVT prophylaxis was changed to argatroban, but it 
will be safe for him to get heparin again. He should have a CBC 
in 1 week to ensure that his platelets are stable.

     HISTORY:  Status post seizure.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no intracranial hemorrhage, or shift of normally midline
     structures.  There is low attenuation throughout the periventricular white
     matter consistent with chronic microvascular infarction.  There is a large
     area of low attenuation in the right temporal lobe consistent with a previous
     infarct.  There is also encephalomalacic change in this region.  There is
     asymmetry of the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles, with the right
     being slightly narrower than the left despite this encephalomalacic change.
     The [**Doctor Last Name 30**]-white matter differentiation otherwise remains intact.  There is no
     evidence of an acute major vascular territorial infarct.  There is
     opacification of the ethmoid air cells, both maxillary sinuses, the sphenoid
     sinus and the left portion of the frontal sinus.  There are no acute
     fractures.  There also is a small amount of fluid in the right mastoid air
     cells.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No intracranial hemorrhage.  
     2.  Evidence of prior infarcts as described above to further evaluate for an
     acute infarct, MRI is more sensitive.
     3.  Diffuse paranasal sinus opacification.

     pneumonia.
     
     Portable AP view of the chest dated [**3402-4-23**], is compared with the PA and
     lateral chest x-ray of [**3402-3-16**].  The inspiratory effort for this film is
     poor and therefore there is increased prominence of the interstitial
     markings. The hilar and cardiac contours are unchanged. No focal infiltrates
     are seen. A rounded density within the left middle lung zone is likely the
     patient's hiatal hernia, which is fluid filled. No large pleural effusions are
     identified. There is no pneumothorax. The surrounding osseous and soft tissue
     structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No focal opacity to suggest consolidation, however, a repeat PA
     and lateral chest x-ray once the patient's condition stabilizes would be
     helpful for definitive assessment of the lung fields.

This is a 78 yo male with a pmed hx of sz d/o, HTN, elevated chol, NIDDM, macular degeneration, who was admitted to the MICU for MS  changes after a seizure.  Within the past few months his dilantin was changed to kepra due to an unsteady gait and dilantin toxocity.  He had a colonoscopy yesterday, when he got home he was tired and didn't take his kepra; an hour later he had a seizure.  His sodium was 120 in the EW but he is chonically hyponatremic with a sodium in the 120s.  He was transfered to [**Hospital1 22**] per family request.  He was aggitated in the EW and was given ativan and haldol, he was also given a dose of kepra at 3pm.  He was given 6 liters of NS in the EW, he put out 5600cc of urine there.

      low grade temps                                  
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Please assess for infiltrate

     INDICATION:  Temperatures.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3402-4-23**].
     
     FINDINGS:
     Smooth bordered retrocardiac density that extends laterally to the chest wall
     has increased in size since the prior study.  However, looking at more prior
     studies, I noted a hiatal hernia has been present in this location.  If this
     were fluid filled, it could easily explain the radiographic appearance.  I
     cannot exclude the possibility of a loculated pleural effusion.  Consider
     right side down decubitus view.  The remainder of the lungs is clear and the
     heart size is within normal limits.  Pulmonary vascular markings are normal.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     Increasing size of smooth-bordered left posterior density which could be a
     hiatal hernia filled with fluid.  Consider CT or left side down decubitus view
     for further delineation or left side down decubitus view could be obtained to
     see this layers out.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      r/o layering effusion

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Left density on prior chest x-ray.  Evaluate for layering
     effusion.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Single left lateral decubitus view of the chest was obtained,
     correlated with the examination performed yesterday.
     
     FINDINGS:  On decubitus view, there is no evidence of layering effusion. 
     Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes remain stable.  The retrocardiac opacity
     probably relates to the known hiatal hernia.

     MRI OF THE BRAIN.
     
     Exam compared to patient's CT scan of [**3402-4-23**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no mass effect or hemorrhage.  There is no displacement of
     normally midline structures.  There is no evidence of a focal extra-axial
     lesion or fluid collection.  Ventricles and sulci are mildly dilated
     consistent with mild brain atrophy.  There is a remote stroke in the right
     parietotemporal region.  There are multiple T2 high signal intensity foci in
     the periventricular white matter and centrum semiovale.  These are nonspecific
     but consistent with microvascular angiopathy.  Some could reflect remote white
     matter infarcts.  The paranasal sinuses are diffusely abnormal with increased
     signal consistent with sinus disease.  There is also increased signal in the
     right mastoid sinus unchanged from the prior study of 5/13.  There is no
     evidence of abnormal diffusion to suggest the presence of acute infarction.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Atrophy and chronic infarcts as described.  Sinus disease
     including the mastoid sinus.  No evidence of acute infarct, mass effect, or
     hemorrhage.
     
     MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **] AND ITS MAJOR TRIBUTARIES.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of aneurysm or flow abnormality.

     INDICATION:  Aspiration.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  The exam was conducted in conjunction with the speech pathologist.
     Multiple consistencies of barium were administered.
     
     ORAL PHASE:  There is normal chewing and bolus formation.  There is mild
     swallowing delay.  PHARYNGEAL PHASE:  There is decreased hyolaryngeal
     elevation.  The epiglottis deflects normally.  There is mild residue in the
     vallecula and piriform sinuses.  Laryngeal penetration is noted with nectar
     consistency with no aspiration.  There were 2 documented episodes of
     aspiration with thin consistency, the first elicited a spontaneous cough with
     subsequent clearance, the second did not elicit a spontaneous cough, but was
     cleared with cued cough.  ESOPHAGEAL PHASE:  No Zenker's diverticulum or web
     is seen.  C-SPINE:  There are several anterior osteophytes most pronounced at
     the C4 and C5 levels.  AP views were not performed.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Penetration, but no aspiration with nectar consistency.
     Aspiration demonstrated with thin liquids with clearance after spontaneous or
     cued cough.
