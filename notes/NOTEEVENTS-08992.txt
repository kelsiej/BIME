Admission Date:  [**2778-11-29**]     Discharge Date:  [**2778-12-4**]

Date of Birth:   [**2690-4-17**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 88-year-old
male with a history of atrial fibrillation, chronic renal
insufficiency, status post abdominal aortic aneurysm repair
in [**2770**], presenting with the acute onset of chest pain and
presyncope on the morning of admission.

The patient was in his usual state of health until the
morning of admission when he developed the acute onset of
chest pressure and lightheadedness after awaking.  Emergency
Medical Service was called, and the patient was noted to be
bradycardic to a heart rate of 20 to 40 and hypotensive.  The
patient was given atropine times two and started on a
dopamine drip.  Mental status was initially lethargic, but
then the patient was alert and oriented times three.  Heart
rate improved with atropine.

The patient was brought to the Emergency Department.  An
electrocardiogram was obtained on arrival to the Emergency
Department which showed evidence of inferior ST elevations
along with a slow atrial fibrillation with a regularized
narrow complex escape rhythm.  He was administered atropine
and dopamine.

The patient was taken emergently to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory.  Cardiac catheterization revealed
a total occlusion of the posterior left ventricular and a
right-dominant circulation.  Additionally, diffuse disease of
the left anterior descending artery (up to 80% proximally)
was identified.  Hemodynamics revealed a cardiac index
of 1.4, with a pulmonary artery saturation of 48%, and a
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 19.  The patient
received a stent in his posterior left ventricular branch.

Status post cardiac catheterization, in recovery, the patient
received 0.5 mg p.o. intravenous Ativan for restlessness of
the lower extremities.  Soon after receiving Ativan, the
patient became agitated with orientation decreased and
slurred speech.  The symptoms did not improve with 0.2 mg of
flunisolide.  A CT scan of the had was done to rule out a
head bleed.  The CT was negative for a bleed.  The patient
was then transferred to the Coronary Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Atrial fibrillation (on Coumadin).
2.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
3.  Status post left nephrectomy.
4.  Status post abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in [**2770**].
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Echocardiogram done in [**2776**] revealed an ejection fraction
of 50% to 55%.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   Metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d., Zestril 10 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Synthroid 0.1 mg p.o. q.d., Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.h.s.
five days of the week along with 7.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. two days
of the week, Xalatan eyedrops q.p.m., Cosopt eyedrops q.a.m.
and q.p.m., Alphagan eyedrops q.a.m. and q.p.m.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient quit tobacco 50 years ago.

FAMILY HISTORY:   The patient denies a family history of
coronary artery disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed a blood pressure of 176/60, heart rate
of 88, respiratory rate of 18, oxygen saturation of 97% on 4
liters nasal cannula.  In general, the patient is an
88-year-old Caucasian male, appearing mildly agitated and
restless.  Alert and oriented only to person.  Head and neck
examination revealed pupils were equal, round, and reactive
to light.  Sclerae were anicteric.  The oropharynx was clear.
Neck revealed jugular venous pressure was about 10 cm.  There
were no carotid bruits.  Chest with mild bibasilar rales.  No
wheezes or rhonchi.  Good aeration throughout.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a normal first heart
sound and second heart sound.  Rhythm was irregularly
irregular.  There was a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the
left lower sternal border.  No rubs or gallops.  The abdomen
was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  There were good bowel
sounds in all four quadrants.  No masses.  Extremities
revealed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Peripheral pulses
were 2+.  Neurologic examination revealed the patient was
alert and oriented times two to person and place.  The
patient had difficulty speaking, appeared confused, was only
able to follow some commands.  The patient was moving all
four extremities.  Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to
light.  Tongue was midline.  Face was symmetric.

     INDICATION: 88-year-old man with bradycardia. Rule out pulmonary edema. The
     patient has a history of renal cell carcinoma.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Chest CT dated [**2778-1-17**].
     
     PORTABLE AP CHEST:  The cardiac or mediastinal and hilar contours are
     unchanged as compared to the CT scout. Increased opacity along the upper right
     mediastinum is unchanged from the prior study and appears to be related to
     known right apical scarring. Linear opacities in the left retrocardiac region
     could represent atelectasis or an early infiltrate. There is no evidence of
     pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema. There are no pleural
     effusions. The soft tissues and osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION: No pulmonary edema. Possible subsegmental atelectasis or early
     infiltrate in the left lower lobe.

     FINDINGS:  Duplex evaluation was performed of both lower extremity arterial
     systems at rest.
     
     On the right, Doppler tracings are monophasic at the femoral, popliteal and
     dorsalis pedis.  The are absent at the posterior tibial level.  The ankle-
     brachial index is 0.60.  Pulse volume recordings showed significant drop-off
     at the calf level and are flatline at the metatarsals.
     
     On the left, Doppler tracings are monophasic at all levels from the femoral
     through the dorsalis pedis.  The ankle-brachial index is 0.64.  Pulse volume
     recordings also showed significant drop-off at the calf level and are flatline
     at the metatarsals.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Significant aortobi-iliac disease.  There is likely a significant
     component of superficial femoral artery and tibial disease, but that cannot be
     clearly determined by this test.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     SUMMARY OF EXERCISE DATA FROM THE REPORT OF THE EXERCISE LAB:
     Persantine was infused intravenously for approximately 4 minutes at a  dose of 
     approximately 0.142 mg/kg/min.  There were no anginal symptoms or ST changes.
      
     HISTORY:  Eighty-nine year old man who presents for preoperative evaluation 
     prior to peripheral vascular surgery.
      
     INTERPRETATION:  One to three minutes after the cessation of infusion, 
     MIBI was administered IV.
      
     Image Protocol: Gated SPECT.
      
     Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium.
     Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.
      
     Stress images demonstrate a severe perfusion defect at the basilar portion of
     the inferior wall.
      
     Resting perfusion images demonstrate this defect to be partially reversible.
      
     Ejection fraction calculated from gated wall motion images obtained after
     Persantine administration shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of
     approximately 47%.  Due to the lack of counts at the basilar portion of the
     inferior wall, that portion of the ventricle is unable to be evaluated for wall
     motion.  The remainder of the ventricle shows mild global hypokinesis.
      
     IMPRESSION:  Ischemia of the basilar portion of the inferior wall.  Mild global
     hypokinesis with EF 47%. /nkg

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:  Nonhealing ulcer of the left second toe. Patient with a history
     of aortobifem graft.
     
     COMPARISON:  Direct comparison is made to a prior MRI of the lower extremities
     dated [**2779-1-16**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Three station MR angiogram was performed with a 3D FAME sequence
     performed after a timing run and utilizing a fluoro trigger technique.
     Approximately 40 cc of Gadolinium was utilized.  Axial 2D time of flight
     images were obtained through the region of the ankles and subsequently from
     the level of the knee joint to the ankles. Multiplanar reconstructions were
     generated and evaluated on a work station.
     
     MR LOWER EXTREMITIES WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:
     
     AORTA: No focal stenosis. Small saccular aneurysm identified in the distal
     aorta in the region of the proximal anastomosis of the graft. The neck of this
     aneurysm has maximal linear dimensions in the craniocaudal direction of 2.1 cm
     and in the AP direction of 1.2 cm.  The aneurysm itself has maximum axial
     dimensions of 1.5 cm in the AP direction and 1.2 cm in the transverse
     direction.
     
     PELVIS: An aorto- biiliac graft is identified with distal anastomotic sites at
     the external iliac arteries. This graft appears within normal limits except
     for the aforementioned small aneurysm adjacent to the proximal anastomotic
     site.
     
     RIGHT:
     Graft segment to the common femoral artery is widely patent. The superficial
     femoral artery is occluded for a long segment from its origin to just above
     the adductor hiatus. There is reconstitution of the most distal superficial
     femoral artery. No focal stenoses are present within the popliteal artery.
     There is straight line flow to the foot via an anterior tibial artery with a
     single mild focal stenosis identified within the proximal anterior tibial
     artery.  Both the posterior tibial artery and the peroneal arteries have
     multifocal areas of narrowing and both are visualized to just above the ankle
     joint.
     
     Right foot: There is a good caliber dorsalis pedis artery, no posterior tibial
     vessel.
     
     LEFT:
     Graft to CFA is widely patent. There is a long segment occlusion of the
     superficial femoral artery and the more proximal above the knee popliteal
     artery. There is reconstitution of a short segment of the above the knee
     popliteal artery with good flow identified in the below the knee popliteal
     artery.  There is straight line run off to the foot via a posterior tibial
     artery. The peroneal artery also has straight line flow to the ankle. A 4 cm
