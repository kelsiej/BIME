Admission Date:  [**2625-8-10**]     Discharge Date:  [**2625-8-12**]

Date of Birth:   [**2544-4-14**]     Sex:  F


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is an 81 year old woman
with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and aortic stenosis,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia and an AV pacemaker, who was
admitted for elective septal ablation.  She has had
progressive worsening of her mixed outflow gradient plus valvular
aortic stenosis and mitral
regurgitation over the past few years with a peak aortic
gradient of 105, a mean of 48, on transthoracic
echocardiogram on [**2625-7-5**], and left ventricular outflow
gradient of 74 by catheterization on [**2625-7-27**].  She is
fully functional and walks approximately one mile per day and
uses a stationary bike, swims about 20 minutes per day and

She denies any shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea or
vomiting associated with exercise, however, she complains of
mild increasing fatigue with exercise over the last few
months.  She denies any claudication, edema, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, or lightheadedness.

Her cardiac history includes a catheterization in [**2619**] which
showed no significant coronary artery disease outside of a
50% lesion at the origin of D1 and mild narrowing of the left
circumflex at its origin.  A repeat catheterization in
[**2625-2-1**], showed  a peak to
peak left ventricular outflow gradient of 53 at rest and 70
with Valsalva maneuver.  Again, no significant coronary
disease, with mild valvular stenosis.

Transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2625-7-5**], showed an
ejection fraction of 65% along with moderate to severe aortic
stenosis, one plus aortic regurgitation, four plus mitral
regurgitation and three plus tricuspid regurgitation with a
gradient across the aortic valve of 48.  Catheterization on
[**2625-7-27**], showed severe resting left ventricular outflow
tract gradient of 74; the gradient increased to 166 with
Dobutamine.  The gradient decreased to 42 with Inderal.
Aortic valve stenosis itself was mild with a peak gradient of 28,
a mean of 23.

Based on increasing left ventricular outflow gradient, an
elective alcohol septal ablation was performed on [**2625-8-10**].  Post-procedure, the left ventricular outflow gradient
at rest and with provocation decreased markedlyto 20 with an
aortic valve gradient unchanged at 25 mmHg, compared with pre-
procedure. There were no complications of the
procedure and the patient was transferred to Cardiac Care
Unit for close hemodynamic monitoring and post myocardial
infarction precautions.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy with septal
    ablation, AND mild valvular aortic stenosis.
2.  PMR.
3.  Osteoarthritis.
4.  History of rheumatic fever as a child.
5.  DDD pacemaker placed in [**2618**] secondary to tachy/brady
    syndrome.
6.  Chronic intermittant Vertigo with left inner ear injury.
7.  Gastrointestinal bleed in [**2624-11-1**], secondary to
    NSAID use.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Back surgery.
2.  Tonsillectomy.
3.  Benign breast biopsy times two.
4.  Dilatation and curettage times two.
5.  Hysterectomy.
6.  Bladder suspension.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No history of smoking; no alcohol use.  She
is a widow and lives alone, fully functional.  Has enlisted
the assistance of a visiting nurse in the past, none
currently.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for a brother who developed
coronary artery disease in his fifties.

ALLERGIES:   Vancomycin which causes itching and a rash;
cephalosporins which cause GI upset; Clindamycin which causes
a rash as well as lip swelling and penicillin which causes
swelling.

MEDICATIONS OUTPATIENT:
1.  Verapamil SR 180 q. day.
2.  Cozaar 50 twice a day.
3.  Lipitor 10 q. h.s.
4.  Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 q. day.
5.  Prednisone 5 q. day.
6.  Protonix 40 q. day.
7.  Premarin 0.3 mg q. day.
8.  Iron 325 three times a day.
9.  Folate 1 mg q. day.
10. Vitamin E 400 Units q. day.
11. Fosamax.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her physical examination on admission
to the Cardiac Care Unit was temperature 96.9 F.; blood
pressure 135/70; heart rate 70 which was ventricular paced;
respiratory rate 17; oxygen saturation was 99% on two liters
nasal cannula.  On examination, in general, she was in no
apparent distress.  She is somnolent but answers questions
appropriately.  HEENT showed an oropharynx which was clear.
Her mucous membranes were slightly dry.  Her jugular venous
pressure was not elevated.  Her neck is supple and there is
no thyromegaly.  On chest examination, her lungs were clear
to auscultation anteriorly (the patient was laying flat due
to femoral catheter in place).  Cardiovascular:  She had a
regular rate, normal S1, S2.  She had a III/VI harsh
holosystolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border
which radiated to the apex.  Her abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended.  She had normoactive bowel sounds.  On
extremity examination, her right groin site was without
oozing, hematoma or bruits.  She had two plus dorsalis pedis
and posterior pulses bilaterally.  Her skin was warm and dry.
On neurological examination she was alert and oriented times
three.  Her cranial nerves II through XII were intact and she
demonstrated understanding of her present condition.

LABORATORY VALUES:  Her white blood cell count was 7.8,
hemoglobin 10.8, hematocrit 30, and platelets were 222.  Her
sodium was 127, potassium 3.2, chloride 92, bicarbonate 28,
BUN 17, creatinine 0.6 and glucose of 150.

EKG done pre-procedure showed ventricular paced with a rate
of 70 beats per minute and a left bundle branch block
morphology.  Post-procedure, the EKG showed again ventricular
pacing with a rate at 76 beats per minute and left bundle
branch block.

IMPRESSION:  This is an 81 year old with hypertrophic
obstructive cardiomyopathy and aortic stenosis with
progressive worsening of exercise tolerance and a rise in her
left ventricular outflow tract gradient.  She is admitted to
Cardiac Care Unit status post elective alcohol ablation with
good results.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient without any significant
coronary artery disease.  Following alcohol induced
septal ablation of LV outflow gradient, the patient was
transferred to Cardiac Care Unit in stable condition.  She was
started on aspirin and Lipitor as well as heparin at 650 units
per hour  Heparin was continued for 24 hours.
Surveillance cardiac enzymes showed a peak CPK of 2240 on [**8-10**], at 04:00 p.m., a few hours after the procedure.  The peak
index was 19.2.  Cardiac enzymes trended downward for the
remainder of the hospital course.

She was restarted on her outpatient anti-hypertensives which
included Cozaar, Verapamil and Hydrochlorothiazide.
Hydrochlorothiazide was later held due to the patient's
hyponatremia.  Her DDD pacemaker was capturing well with a
heart rate of 70.

2.  Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition:   On presentation,
the patient was hyponatremic and hyperkalemic, which was
partly at baseline, but additionally attributed to a large
amount of intravenous fluids received in the catheterization
laboratory.  She was switched to normal saline with
supplementation of potassium and her electrolytes normalized.
Hydrochlorothiazide was held due to electrolyte abnormalities
but will be restarted upon discharge.

3.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient with complaints of black
stool times one but denied any bright red blood per rectum.
Given her history of GI bleed in the past, stools were
ordered for guaiac.  However, at the time of dictation, no
stools were available for guaiac.  Hematocrits remained
stable at 33.0 throughout hospital course which was at
patient's baseline.

DISPOSITION:   The patient was out of bed and ambulating by
hospital day number two without any difficulties.  A fasting
lipid panel was run on the day of discharge which showed a
triglyceride of 93, HDL 63, LDL 64, for which the patient
will follow-up with primary care physician.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   Improved, stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy status post alcohol ablation,
AND stable mild valvular aortic stenosis.
2.  Polymyalgia rheumatica.
3.  Osteoarthritis.
4.  DDD pacemaker.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Hyperlipidemia.
7.  Anemia.
8.  History of gastrointestinal bleed.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg q. day.
2.  Losartan 50 twice a day.
3.  Verapamil SR 180 q. day.
4.  Lipitor 20 q. day.
5.  Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 q. day.
6.  Prednisone 5 mg q. day.
7.  Folate 1 mg q. day.
8.  Protonix 40 q. day.
9.  Premarin 0.3 mg q. day.

The patient had current medications at home, and therefore is
not discharged with any prescriptions.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  A follow-up appointment to be scheduled by the patient
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1768**] for follow-up in two weeks.
2.  She will also continue regular followup with her primary
care physician at [**Hospital6 2536**].
