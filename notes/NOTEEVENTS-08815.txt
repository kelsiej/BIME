chest pain
shortness of breath

History of Present Illness:
69 yo with metastatic cancer to lung, with unknown primary had 
chemo today and then developed acure onset of chest pain at 2 am 
that woke her from [**Doctor Last Name 314**], described as [**7-4**] with diaphoresis, 
nausea and SOB with STE inferiorly and laterally she notes that 
it was simlar to her previous episodes of CP that she has had in 
the past, but never had an MI.  She still had CP on arrival to 
ED and was taken to cath lab directly after head CT neg for 
bleed or mass effect with concern for mets.  She was started on 
nitro, heparin and integrillin gtt. Cath with normal coronaries 
except 40%ostial LCX, elevated right and left heart pressures 
and low cardiac output, thought to have pericarditis.  Currently 
she feels alright, pain is gone, but it comes and goes.  She 
hasn't noticed a difference or improvement with NTG.  She had 
started her first dose of chemo today as well, and notes she has 
been losing some weight, but otherwise denies any URI, 
f/c/sweats/SOB besides with the pain or pain anywhere else.
*****
Briefly, 69yo woman with h/o HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM2, bladder 
CA, metastatic lung cancer who had chemo on DOA with 
carboplatin/gemcytobene, then developed acute onset chest pain, 
SOB that woke her from [**Doctor Last Name 314**], found to have pericarditis with 
pericardial effusion but no tamponade. A head CT was neg for 
bleed or mass effect but with concern for metastatic disease. 
She was taken to cath lab for concern about MI, had no flow 
limiting lesions (40%ostial LCX), evidence of left heart 
diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary HTN with increased 
right sided filling pressures. Also had a TTE ([**3141-6-27**]) that 
showed normal regional left ventricular wall motion, 
hyperdynamic LV (EF>75%), and a small pericardial effusion that 
was stable on repeat TTE ([**3141-6-29**]). 
.
Over the weekend, the patient had acute worsening of her 
shortness of breath in the setting of receiving a blood 
transfusion for her anemia, with chest xray revealing pulmonary 
edema consistent with a flash from her known hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy. Also of note, the patient developed cough 
productive of copious yellow sputum, and given her 
immunosuppression from chemotherapy as well as the CTA findings, 
was started on Ceftaz/Flagyl and diuresed with Lasix. The CTA 
showed: no PE, multiple pulmonary nodules c/w metastases, 
multiple pleural-based metastases with adjacent invasion into 
the ribs, a loculated hydropneumothorax in the proximal left 
lower lobe, compressive atelectasis or consolidation in the left 
lower lobe, a loculated pleural fluid collection in the 
posterior left base, and a small to moderate pericardial 
effusion. In talking with her Oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12272**] at [**Hospital 9881**], the CMed resident confirmed that most of these findings 
were not new. The Oncologist did not feel that a transfer to DF 
was warranted as it seemed the patient might be able to be 
discharged soon from [**Hospital1 83**].
.
Since undergoing diuresis and starting on Ceftaz/Flagyl, the 
patient's shortness of breath has improved dramatically, and her 
sputum production has decreased as well. Of note, she is also 
developing pancytopenia but has remained afebrile with ANC 1000 
today. She also has a climbing sodium concentration and BUN/Cr 
ratio, taking in only tube feeds and occassion ice.

Brief Hospital Course:
69 yo woman with presumed metastatic lung CA, possible 
post-obstructive pna, transferred to the CCU with pericarditis 
and tamponade s/p pericardial drain placement and fungemia. 
.  
1) Pericarditis/pericardial effusion: THis is felt to be a 
malignant effusion from metastatic disease. She underwnet 
pericariocentesis and pericardial drain placement on [**3141-7-9**]. 
THoracic surgery was consulted to place a window but she was too 
sick as there was concern for collapsing a lung during the 
procedure and that she would not have enough lung reserve to 
survive that. Pericardial fluid sent grew yeast. Drainage 
diminished and the drain was pulled given infection and no 
re-accumulation.
.
2) ID: She was transferred with fungemia ([**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2061**]) on 
voriconazole that was swtiched to caspofungin. Her blood was 
also positive enterococcus faecium and she was started on 
vancomycin. Her post obstructive pneumonia was treated with 
ceftazidime and zosyn initially, then meropenum. 
.  
3) Hypotension: 
She became septic with initial SVR 450. She was started on 
vasopressin on [**7-9**] and levophed. She was pressor dependent from 
then on.
.  
4) Resp:
She had a post-obstructive pna and pleural effusion:  
She was treated with Ceftaz/Flagyl and then meropenum. CT chest 
showed loculated effusions that were not amenable for 
throacentesis. She was intubated on [**7-9**] for respiratory failure 
secondary to fatigue. The posivtive pressure helped to open 
collapsed L lung.
She had a bronchoscopy on [**7-8**], with no frank obstruction, 
extrinsic compression of L lower bronchus. 
.  
5) Metastatic lung CA: followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12273**] at [**Company 7414**], spoke to 
him on [**7-9**],per records it is a squamous cell pathology, likely 
lung. He said given poor prognosis would not favor aggressive 
treatment.
.  
6) Pancytopenia:  
-Anemia: felt to be secondary to recent chemotherapy. SHe was 
transfused for hematocrits less than 27. 
-Thrombocytopenia: Her platelets dropped, likely from 
chemotherapy. Her HIT antibody was negative.    

7) CV: 
Rhythm - She was in intermittent atrial flutter, initially 
treated with diltiazem but that was discontinued when she became 
septic.

8) Metabolic acidosis: Non anion gap, likely ARF from ATN and 
RTA given + urine anion gap.

9) Goals of care: Given her multiple organ failure and inability 
to wean from the ventilator, and her poor prognosis with the 
metastatic cancer, her code status was changed to DNR. After 
several days of no improvement and continued septic picture and 
dependence on pressors and ventilator, additinal family meetings 
were held. She was made CMO and passed away comfortably with her 
family at her side on [**3141-7-14**].

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:  A 69-year-old woman with metastatic cancer with tachycardia and
     hypoxia.
     
     COMPARISONS:  No prior CT.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial CT images of the chest were acquired without IV contrast.
     Then, a CT angiogram of the chest with IV contrast was performed, and sagittal
     and coronal reconstructions were also performed.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is a central venous
     catheter whose tip terminates in the distal SVC.  There are coronary artery
     calcifications.  There is a percutaneous feeding tube in the stomach, not
     fully evaluated here.
     
     There are multiple bilateral pleural pulmonary nodules.  These are fairly
     dense with irregular borders and some spiculation.  These may represent foci
     of metastatic disease, although in the appropriate clinical setting, septic
     emboli would be a consideration.  There is no mediastinal, hilar or axial
     lymphadenopathy although small mediastinal nodes are present, which do not
     meet CT criteria for pathological enlargement.  There is a small to moderate
     pericardial effusion.  The great vessels are unremarkable without evidence of
     pulmonary embolism.
     
     In addition to the bilateral pulmonary nodules, there is atelectatic change at
     the right base.  In the left lung, there is a large soft tissue mass in the
     anterior left upper lobe, which is eroding into the adjacent rib with bony
     destruction. There is a second site as well of pleural- based soft tissue
     density with bony destruction of adjacent rib. These masses may stem from
     either bony or pleural-based metastases but now span the chest wall.
     
     In this latter region at the left base, there is adjacent compressive
     atelectasis or consolidation. Posteriorly at the left lung base is a loculated
     crescentic collection of fluid surrounded by probably enhancing tissue. More
     centrally in the left lower lobe adjacent to the hilum is an area of loculated
     fluid and gas. This overall appearance could all be due to metastatic disease,
     although superimposed infection is not excluded as well.
     
     Very limited views of the upper abdomen are unremarkable. There is some soft
     tissue density adjacent to the stomach in the lesser sac, which could
     represent fluid, but cannot be characterized here.
                                                                 (Over)

     BONE WINDOWS:  Multiple left destructive bony lesions are described above.
     There are no other suspicious lytic or blastic lesions visualized.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Sagittal and coronal reformats confirm the axial
     findings.
     
     NOTE: The patient had a history of IV contrast reaction with throat swelling
     in the past. However, the patient was premedicated with steroids by the
     referring team and gave informed consent for the procedure in spite of the
     history of allergy. No allergic reaction occurred.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, which probably represent metastases,
     although the possibility of a septic emboli cannot be excluded.
     2.  Multiple peripheral metastatic masses with destruction of adjacent ribs.
     3.  Loculated hydropneumothorax in the proximal left lower lobe.
     4.  Compressive atelectasis or consolidation in the left lower lobe.
     5.  Small loculated pleural fluid collection in the posterior left base.
     6.  Small to moderate pericardial effusion.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
       69 year old woman with met CA now with tachycardia, hypoxia                    
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      evaluate left lower lobe infiltrate, rule out PE                                
     No contraindications for IV contrast

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:  A 69-year-old woman with metastatic cancer with tachycardia and
     hypoxia.
     
     COMPARISONS:  No prior CT.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial CT images of the chest were acquired without IV contrast.
     Then, a CT angiogram of the chest with IV contrast was performed, and sagittal
     and coronal reconstructions were also performed.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is a central venous
     catheter whose tip terminates in the distal SVC.  There are coronary artery
     calcifications.  There is a percutaneous feeding tube in the stomach, not
     fully evaluated here.
     
     There are multiple bilateral pleural pulmonary nodules.  These are fairly
     dense with irregular borders and some spiculation.  These may represent foci
     of metastatic disease, although in the appropriate clinical setting, septic
     emboli would be a consideration.  There is no mediastinal, hilar or axial
     lymphadenopathy although small mediastinal nodes are present, which do not
     meet CT criteria for pathological enlargement.  There is a small to moderate
     pericardial effusion.  The great vessels are unremarkable without evidence of
     pulmonary embolism.
     
     In addition to the bilateral pulmonary nodules, there is atelectatic change at
     the right base.  In the left lung, there is a large soft tissue mass in the
     anterior left upper lobe, which is eroding into the adjacent rib with bony
     destruction. There is a second site as well of pleural- based soft tissue
     density with bony destruction of adjacent rib. These masses may stem from
     either bony or pleural-based metastases but now span the chest wall.
     
     In this latter region at the left base, there is adjacent compressive
     atelectasis or consolidation. Posteriorly at the left lung base is a loculated
     crescentic collection of fluid surrounded by probably enhancing tissue. More
     centrally in the left lower lobe adjacent to the hilum is an area of loculated
     fluid and gas. This overall appearance could all be due to metastatic disease,
     although superimposed infection is not excluded as well.
     
     Very limited views of the upper abdomen are unremarkable. There is some soft
     tissue density adjacent to the stomach in the lesser sac, which could
     represent fluid, but cannot be characterized here.
                                                                 (Over)

     BONE WINDOWS:  Multiple left destructive bony lesions are described above.
     There are no other suspicious lytic or blastic lesions visualized.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Sagittal and coronal reformats confirm the axial
     findings.
     
     NOTE: The patient had a history of IV contrast reaction with throat swelling
     in the past. However, the patient was premedicated with steroids by the
     referring team and gave informed consent for the procedure in spite of the
     history of allergy. No allergic reaction occurred.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, which probably represent metastases,
     although the possibility of a septic emboli cannot be excluded.
     2.  Multiple peripheral metastatic masses with destruction of adjacent ribs.
     3.  Loculated hydropneumothorax in the proximal left lower lobe.
     4.  Compressive atelectasis or consolidation in the left lower lobe.
     5.  Small loculated pleural fluid collection in the posterior left base.
     6.  Small to moderate pericardial effusion.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     INDICATION:  Chest pain, shortness of breath and hypotension.  Status post
     Swan-Ganz placement.  Productive cough.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3141-7-4**].
     
     SEMI-ERECT AP PORTABLE CHEST:  The Swan-Ganz catheter remains in similar
     position with its tip in the interlobar right pulmonary artery.  A presumed
     pericardial drain has been inserted, projecting over the lower left
     hemithorax.  A gastric tube is noted.  There is decreased aeration of the left
     lung.  Given the relative lack of rightward mediastinal shift, this most
     likely represents progressive collapse of the left lung.  The left pleural
     effusion probably also contribute to this appearance.  A small right effusion
     persists.  CHF has increased.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Complete opacitification of left hemithorax, probably due to lung
     collapse given lack of contralateral shift of mediastinum. A component of
     pleural effusion is also present.
     2)  Increased failure.  Persistent bilateral pleural effusions, left greater
     than right.
     3)  Presumed pericardial drain insertion.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  69-year-old woman with metastatic carcinoma of unknown primary,
     now with increasing signs of sepsis, including respiratory failure.  Please
     evaluate for possible septic source.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT angiography of the chest, [**3141-6-29**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  After administration of oral contrast, an MDCT was used to obtain
     contiguous axial images through the liver.  IV contrast enhanced images
     through the chest and abdomen, as well as 3 minute delayed abdominal and
     pelvic images were also obtained.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  As seen on the previous examination, there
     are multiple lung nodules in both lungs.  These have not changed significantly
     in the interim.  However, there has been interval development of a loculated
     right pleural effusion, moderate in size, with associated compressive
     atelectasis.  A smaller left pleural effusion is also present, with associated
     atelectasis.  Also, as previously described, in the left lower lobe there is a
     large loculated collection of fluid and air, between the aorta and proximal
     stomach.  It is not significantly changed since the last examination.  This
     collection may represent necrotic tumor or necrotic lung.  It measures
     approximately 56 x 70 mm.  The pericardial effusion has improved, although it
     is still present. No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy is definitively
     identified. Increased prominence of septal lines indicates a degree of fluid
     overload.  
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  A 7 mm lesion in the right
     lobe of the liver is identified, which is too small to characterize fully. The
     left adrenal medial limb has an 11 x 21 mm lesion ([**Doctor Last Name **] 19 pre-contrast, 120
     post-contrast) which may represent another focus of metastasis.  The right
     adrenal has a similar appearing lesion, 11 x 13 mm, ([**Doctor Last Name **] 34 pre-contrast, 120
     post-contrast), which also may represent a focus of metastasis.  The left
     kidney has an exophytic 10 mm low-density lesion, too small to fully
     characterize, but probably a cyst.  Within the mid pole of the right kidney,
     heterogeneously enhancing foci may also represent metastasis. The pancreas is
     grossly unremarkable.  There is no lymphadenopathy.  The gallbladder has
     layering sludge, but is without CT evidence of cholecystitis. The stomach has
     a gastrostomy tube within it.  Contrast is seen in the stomach and proximal
     small bowel loops.
                                                                 (Over)

     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Diastasis of the rectus muscles results in
     a small hernia containing a loop of small bowel.  There is a diverting ostomy
     in the right lower quadrant.  Suture lines in the distal bowel indicate prior
     bowel resection.  The uterus is surgically absent.  There are staples along
     the iliac vessels and pouch of [**Location (un) 2421**].  The rectum and sigmoid are grossly
     unremarkable.  There is a small amount of fluid in the left paracolic gutter.
     No free fluid is seen in the pelvis.  
     
     Of note, there is extensive infiltration of fluid into the subcutaneous
     tissues.  
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  A pathological fracture is identified in the left lateral
     eighth rib.  Also seen is a 49 x 33 mm soft tissue mass investing the left
     eleventh and twelfth ribs.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Loculated hydropneumothorax in the left lower lobe, as previously
     identified on CT scan of [**3141-6-29**], which may represent infected
     cavity, necrotic tumor or necrotic lung.
     2.  Multiple foci of probable metastatic disease, including bilateral
     pulmonary nodules, soft tissue masses investing and destroying left-sided
     ribs, and bilateral adrenal masses.
     3.  Interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left,
     with right pleural effusion containing a loculated component.
     4.  Worsening consolidation/atelectasis of the left lower lobe.
     5.  Cardiac failure and fluid overload, with anasarca.
     6.  Low-density lesion in the liver, too small to fully characterize.
     7.  Diastasis of rectus muscles with hernia containing a small bowel loop.
     8.  Right lower quadrant diverting ostomy.
