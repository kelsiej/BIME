Service:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 85-year-old white male has
a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and had a
positive stress test.  He has had six months of increased
dyspnea on exertion, shortness of breath, and nausea.  His
exercise tolerance test on [**6-17**] revealed moderate-severe
inferior apical ischemia and inferior apical hypokinesis.  He
underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2653-6-30**] at [**Hospital1 74**] which revealed the left main
coronary artery had 80% distal concentric stenosis, LAD had
70 and 80% tandem mid vessel lesions and diffuse disease with
left to right collaterals.  Diagonal 1 had a 60% lesion.
Left circumflex had a 70% OM-1 lesion, and the RCA had a 50%
mid lesion.  The left ventricle had an apical aneurysm with
an ejection fraction of 55%, apical dyskinesis.  Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted for CABG.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. Hypercholesterolemia.
3. Status post gastrointestinal bleed secondary to
nonsteroidal use.
4. History of prostate cancer status post radiation therapy.
5. Status post orchiectomy.
6. Status post inguinal hernia repair.
7. History of gout.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Lopressor 50 mg po q am, 25 mg po q pm.
2. Imdur 60 mg po q am, 30 mg po q pm.
3. Lipitor 10 mg po q day.
4. Allopurinol 100 mg po q day.
5. Aspirin 81 mg po q day.
6. Iron 325 mg po q day.

ALLERGIES:  Ether.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for coronary artery disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives alone.  He has a 120 pack year
smoking history, quit 25 years prior to admission.  Does not
drink alcohol.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Unremarkable.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical exam, he is a
well-developed elderly white male in no apparent distress.
Vital signs stable, afebrile.  HEENT exam:  Normocephalic,
atraumatic.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Oropharynx is
benign.  He had upper and lower dentures.  Neck was supple,
full range of motion, no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
Carotids are 2+ and equal bilaterally with a positive
radiating murmur.  Lungs were clear to auscultation and
percussion.  Cardiovascular examination regular, rate, and
rhythm, normal S1, S2, with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen was soft and nontender with positive bowel sounds.
No masses or hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities are without
clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Pulses were 2+ and equal
bilaterally throughout.  He had an intra-aortic balloon in
place in the right groin.  Neurologic examination was
nonfocal.

The patient was admitted to the CCU following cardiac
catheterization, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted, and on
[**7-1**], the patient underwent a CABG x3 with LIMA to the LAD,
reverse saphenous Y graft to the diagonal and OM.
Cross-clamp time was 87 minutes, total bypass time 112
minutes.  He was transferred to the CSRU on nitroglycerin and
propofol in stable condition.  He did have increased chest
tube output immediately postoperatively, and was re-explored
for bleeding.  There was no specific source found.  Hematoma
was evacuated, and the patient was transferred back to the
CSRU in stable condition.

He remained intubated overnight.  He did have his
intra-aortic balloon pump removed on postoperative day #1.
He did remain intubated as he was quite fluid overloaded.  He
continued to be diuresed, was off all drips.  He did complain
of right lower quadrant abdominal tenderness and General
Surgery was consulted, that was on postoperative day #3.

He got an abdominal CT scan which revealed question of
thickened cecum with stranding, but was negative for free
air.  He was followed and continued to have abdominal
distention and pain which waxed and waned.

He was extubated on postoperative day #5.  His chest tubes
were also discontinued.  He was then started on a regular
diet.  He did then continue to complain of right lower
quadrant abdominal pain, so he had an abdominal CT scan on
[**7-7**] and was taken to the operating room for small bowel
resection, and a necrotic ileal segment was found.  The
patient was transferred back to the CSRU and was stable.  He
was intubated and on TPN.

He slowly improved.  He is on Flagyl and Zosyn, and he was
followed by ID.  He was extubated on postoperative day of
abdominal surgery.  Continued to require pulmonary therapy
and diuresis.  He remained on TPN.  He had some temperature
spikes.  All the cultures were negative, and he was continued
empirically on Zosyn.

Patient remained NPO and on postoperative day #7 he had his
nasogastric tube inserted and started on clear liquids.  He
continued to advance his diet.  Continued to progress and on
postoperative day 17 and 10, he started to have melena.  He
was seen by GI.  He had a negative upper scope, EGD, and then
he continued to bleed required 10 units of packed cells.  He
also had a colonoscopy on [**7-20**] in which the anastomotic
site of the ileum was not shown, but there was no evidence of
active bleeding throughout the entire colon and distal
terminal ileum.  So he was treated conservatively and
continued to eat, and eventually this bleeding resolved.

The patient was transferred to the floor postoperative day
#22.  He continued to progress, and was discharged to
rehabilitation on postoperative day 25.

LABORATORIES ON DISCHARGE:  Hematocrit is 33.3, white count
9,700, platelets 420.  Sodium 133, potassium 4.1, chloride

     INDICATIONS:  Abdominal pain.  Evaluate for appendicitis or mesenteric
     ischemia.
     
     No prior CT scans are available for comparison.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were acquired helically
     from the lung bases through the pubic symphysis before and after
     administration of 150 cc of Optiray contrast.  Non-ionic contrast was used per
     patient request.  There were no adverse reactions to contrast administration.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are bibasilar consolidations with
     small pleural effusions.  A mediastinal drain and left-sided chest tube are
     present.  There is a small loculated pneumothorax on the left.
     
     No focal hepatic lesions are identified.  The gallbladder is distended without
     evidence of cholecystitis.  The spleen demonstrates areas of abnormal
     enhancement, which may represent infarcts.  The left kidney also demonstrates
     segmental areas of decreased perfusion in both the upper and lower pole which
     may represent infarcts.  Numerous bilateral renal cysts are present.  No
     right-sided renal perfusion abnormalities are noted.  The pancreas and stomach
     are unremarkable.  The intraabdominal loops of small bowel are opacified
     proximally, and at the upper limit of normal in size.  No contrast has passed
     into the distal small bowel loops.  There is a small amount of free fluid in
     the abdomen anterior to the liver.  No pathologically enlarged mesenteric or
     retroperitoneal nodes are seen.  The abdominal aorta is diffusely calcified
     and demonstrates extensive mural plaquing.  The infrarenal abdominal aorta
     also demonstrates minimal aneurysmal dilatation with a maximum diameter of 3.1
     cm.  The dilation extends into both common iliac arteries, where the caliber
     returns to normal.
     
     Within the region of the hepatic flexure is a focal segment of colonic wall
     thickening.  There is minimal surrounding stranding.  This loop of colon is
     not completely distended, however, limiting evaluation.  Numerous diverticula
     are seen in this area.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  A

     descending colonic diverticula are present without evidence of acute
     diverticulitis.  The appendix is well visualized, and is unremarkable.  The
     prostate is normal in size.  No pathologically enlarged inguinal or pelvic

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:  Abdominal pain.  Evaluate for appendicitis or mesenteric
     ischemia.
     
     No prior CT scans are available for comparison.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were acquired helically
     from the lung bases through the pubic symphysis before and after
     administration of 150 cc of Optiray contrast.  Non-ionic contrast was used per
     patient request.  There were no adverse reactions to contrast administration.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are bibasilar consolidations with
     small pleural effusions.  A mediastinal drain and left-sided chest tube are
     present.  There is a small loculated pneumothorax on the left.
     
     No focal hepatic lesions are identified.  The gallbladder is distended without
     evidence of cholecystitis.  The spleen demonstrates areas of abnormal
     enhancement, which may represent infarcts.  The left kidney also demonstrates
     segmental areas of decreased perfusion in both the upper and lower pole which
     may represent infarcts.  Numerous bilateral renal cysts are present.  No
     right-sided renal perfusion abnormalities are noted.  The pancreas and stomach
     are unremarkable.  The intraabdominal loops of small bowel are opacified
     proximally, and at the upper limit of normal in size.  No contrast has passed
     into the distal small bowel loops.  There is a small amount of free fluid in
     the abdomen anterior to the liver.  No pathologically enlarged mesenteric or
     retroperitoneal nodes are seen.  The abdominal aorta is diffusely calcified
     and demonstrates extensive mural plaquing.  The infrarenal abdominal aorta
     also demonstrates minimal aneurysmal dilatation with a maximum diameter of 3.1
     cm.  The dilation extends into both common iliac arteries, where the caliber
     returns to normal.
     
     Within the region of the hepatic flexure is a focal segment of colonic wall
     thickening.  There is minimal surrounding stranding.  This loop of colon is
     not completely distended, however, limiting evaluation.  Numerous diverticula
     are seen in this area.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  A
     Foley catheter is present within the bladder.  Extensive sigmoid and
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION:  Markedly increased WBC, without history of recent abdominal
     intervention.  Status post CABG with complications.
     
     CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed after the administration of oral
     and IV contrast.  Comparison is made to the prior study from four days ago.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is unchanged bilateral atelectasis and small pleural
     effusions, with interval improvement of left-sided pneumothorax.  There is
     still a tiny residual left-sided pneumothorax at the inferior-most portion of
     the chest anteriorly.  The liver is within normal limits.  The gallbladder is
     distended.  The pancreas and adrenal glands appear to be within normal limits.
      Geographic areas of hypo-enhancement involving the spleen are unchanged,
     representing prior infarction.  At the lower pole of the right kidney, again
     seen is a geographically hypo-dense region, which is also suspicious for
     infarction.  There are at least two 8 mm, well-rounded, hypo-dense lesions
     within the left kidney, which are likely cysts.  In the right kidney, there
     are multiple larger cysts, one which measures 25 mm, and one which measures 16
     mm.  There is also a wedge-shaped hypo-density in the lower pole of the right
     kidney, which may represent an infarction as well.  The stomach is
     unremarkable, and there is a slight increase in the dilation of small bowel,
     reaching a maximum of 4 cm now.  In the right lower quadrant, and less so in
     the right upper quadrant, there is a significant worsening of mesenteric fat
     stranding, and there may also be minimal thickening of the ___ ? wall ___ of
     the large colon at the hepatic flexure.  Also, there appears to be very little
     oral contrast passing through the small bowel within this region.  There is
     trace ascites adjacent to the liver.  No definite abdominal adenopathy.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The pelvic bowel, bladder, and ureters are
     within normal limits.  There is a small amount of pelvic free fluid present.
     There is no definite pelvic lymph adenopathy.
     
     Examination of the osseous structures shows no signal abnormalities.  There
     are scattered calcifications of the aorta, predominantly in an infrarenal
     distribution, and there is also significant plaque within the aorta.
     Sternotomy wires are seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  With splenic and renal infarct, the interval development of stranding
                                                                 (Over)

     involving the right mesenteric fat around the right small bowel and colon, as
     well as the lack of transit of contrast through the small bowel and possible

     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
        85 year old man with                                                          
         
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      s/p small bowel resection for dead bowel and anastomosis, now with increased 
      abd tenderness/distention, r/o large fluid collections, leak ...slow po 
      contrast prep, no iv
     CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST:
      rising creatinine
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Abdominal distention and tenderness after small bowel resection
     for dead bowel.  Question fluid collection or leak.
     
     CT of the abdomen and pelvis is performed after the administration of oral
     contrast.  No IV contrast was given for impaired renal function.
     
     FINDINGS:  Lung bases show elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, with bilateral
     atelectasis and pleural effusions.  There is a small pericardial effusion, and
     coronary artery calcifications.  There is excretion of contrast into the
     gallbladder.  The liver, pancreas, adrenal glands, stomach, and small bowel
     are unremarkable. Replaced hepatic artery from the SMA. There is a small
     amount of ascites. There is some heterogeneity of the spleen, with hypodensity
     corresponding to areas of prior splenic infarct.  There is also poorly defined
     heterogeneity of both kidneys, representing combination of renal cysts and
     areas of prior infarction. Additionally, an exophytic renal cyst is again seen
     in the lateral aspect of the midpole of the right kidney.  There is vascular
     calcification of the aorta, particularly the infrarenal portion.  There is no
     abdominal lymphadenopathy.  There is diffuse mesenteric fat stranding,
     particularly involving the right lower quadrant. The appendix is normal. The
     wall of the hepatic flexure may be thickened. In examination of the vascular
     structures of the abdomen (limited by noncontrast technique), there is a
     subtle hypodensity in the base of the celiac artery, which may represent
     thrombus, especially when correlated in retrospect with the prior study of
     three days ago. However, note that evaluation of vascular thrombus is neither
     sensitive nor specific in this noncontrast examination.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There is a small amount of free abdominal
     fluid tracking into the pelvis.  There is diverticulosis without
     diverticulitis, and a normal appearance of the left colon and transverse
     colon.  As described above, there is an inflammatory appearance of the cecum
     and hepatic flexure, although there is no evidence of free air or pneumatosis
     in this region.  There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy.
     
     Examination of osseous structures show degenerative changes without suspicious
     lytic or blastic lesions.
                                                                 (Over)

     Coronally and sagittally reformatted images support these findings.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No free air or drainable fluid collection within the abdomen.
     2.  Thickening of the proximal colon (to the hepatic flexure) of unclear
     clinical significance.
     3.  Possible thrombus within the proximal celiac artery.
