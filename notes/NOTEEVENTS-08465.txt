Admission Date: [**3347-3-24**]        Discharge Date: [**3347-4-8**]

Date of Birth:  [**3268-9-17**]        Sex:  M

Service:  CSU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78 year old gentleman
who was resuscitated after a witnessed arrest in the field.
After the arrest the patient was transported to [**Hospital 737**] and subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 74**].  Cardiac catheterization done at
the outside hospital showed 50 percent left main, 70 percent
LAD proximally and 99 percent distal lesion.  Ejection
fraction by echocardiogram at outside hospital was read as 50
percent.  Patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for coronary
artery bypass grafting.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Atrial fibrillation.
2. Left bundle branch block.
3. Coronary artery disease.
4. Status post myocardial infarction.
5. Hypercholesterolemia.
6. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
7. Hypertension.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient lives with his wife.  Denies tobacco
use.  Admits to drinking two to three glasses of wine per
week.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:
1. Procamide.
2. Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg P.O. q day.
3. Coreg 12.5 mg P.O. q day.
4. Lipitor 10 mg P.O. q day.
5. Zestril 2.5 mg P.O. q day.


HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 74**], evaluated for surgery.  On
evaluation, review of the cardiac catheterization films
revealed that the patient's inferior ejection fraction was
approximately 20 percent.  Patient was taken to the operating
room on [**3347-3-27**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] where a coronary artery
bypass graft times three with a LIMA to LAD and saphenous
vein graft to diagonal and saphenous vein graft to OM.
Please see operative note for full details.  Total
cardiopulmonary bypass time was 36 minutes, crossclamp time
51 minutes.  Patient was transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit on dobutamine infusion with good hemodynamics.  In the
operating room by transesophageal echocardiogram the
patient's ejection fraction was estimated to be approximately
25 percent which improved to 40 percent post cardiopulmonary
bypass plus the addition of inotropic support.  Patient was
weaned and extubated from the mechanical ventilation on his
first postoperative evening.  The dobutamine was weaned off
on postoperative day number one with continued good
hemodynamics.  Patient was started on low dose Lopressor
which he tolerated well.  On the night of postoperative day
number one patient went into rapid atrial fibrillation with
subsequent hypotension.  Patient was given Lopresor and
amiodarone due to hypotension.  The patient was started on
Neo-Synephrine.  During this patient did not have pulmonary
artery catheter but signs of cardiac output were good.

Postoperative day number two electrophysiology service was
consulted and the patient would undergo attempted EP
cardioversion and anesthesia administered adequate sedation
and cardioversion was attempted times three.  On the second
and third attempts at 360 joules patient had two beats of
sinus rhythm and subsequently returned to atrial
fibrillation.  At that time it was decided to continue the
patient on amiodarone and to attempt cardioversion at a later
date.  In addition, the electrophysiology team had been
consulted for placement of an AICD due to patient's
preoperative cardiac arrest.  Also on postoperative day
number two patient was found by laboratory data to have a
sodium of 127.  The day previously, postoperative day number
one the patient's sodium was 130.  Patient had a moderate to
large amount of urine output without any administration of
Lasix.  A renal consult was obtained for management of the
hyponatremia with the laboratory data of the plasma
osmolarity of 264 and a urine osmolarity of 352 it was felt
that the patient was having SIADH versus heart failure
related ADH really.  He recommended fluid restriction and
Lasix administration as needed.  Patient's sodium slowly
began to rise after declining on postoperative day three to
126 and ultimately rose to 134.

Postoperative day number three patient continued in atrial
fibrillation requiring Ancef and continued on amiodarone
infusion.  Preliminary coagulation studies were checked.
Prior to starting patient on heparin for anticoagulation it
was noted that the patient had an elevated PTT and
examination of prior laboratory data showed that the patient
had consistently had PTTs in the mid 50s.  Hematology consult
was obtained and on laboratory examination it was determined
that patient had a lupus anticoagulant and elevated
anticardiolipin antibody titer.  In light of this it was
recommended that patient be started on heparin for
anticoagulation as this patient made patient hypercoagulable
and recommended as patient's PTTs were elevated factor 10A
level should be followed.  Also on postoperative day number
three patient was taken by the electrophysiology service for
implantation of automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator.
Patient had a [**Company **] AICD with DDD pacing facilities,
model number 7289 implanted on [**3347-3-31**].  Patient
tolerated this procedure well.  During the implantation of
the AICD patient was converted into sinus rhythm.

On postoperative day number seven it was found that patient's
platelet count was decreasing, had been 113 on postoperative
day number five, had dropped to 79 on postoperative day
number six and was 70 on postoperative day number seven.
Patient had previously had a heparin antibody sent which was
negative.  However, repeat heparin antibody sent at the time
was subsequently positive and the heparin infusion was
discontinued.  Per the recommendation of hematology patient
was started on lepirudin as well as Coumadin.

On postoperative day number eight patient went back into
atrial fibrillation, continued to require low dose Neo-
Synephrine which was eventually weaned off on postoperative
day number nine.  Patient had been started on beta blocker,
continued on amiodarone and by postoperative day number nine
patient was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the
regular side of the hospital.  Patient had converted from
atrial fibrillation to AV paced and after less than 24 hours
of patient being on the lepirudin infusion and two doses of
Coumadin patient was found to have a PPD greater than 150 and
an INR of 2.2.  The lepirudin infusion was stopped and
consultation with the hematology service recommended if
patient's INR remains greater than 2 to not restart the
lepirudin infusion.  Physical therapy was working with the
patient.  It was recommended patient would benefit from acute
rehabilitation and by postoperative day 11 patient was taken
to the electrophysiology laboratory for testing of the AICD.
It was found to be functioning properly.  By postoperative
day number 11 patient was cleared for discharge to
rehabilitation.
