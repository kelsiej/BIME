     CLINICAL INDICATION: Status post mediastinoscopy. Evaluate for pneumothorax.
     
     No prior chest radiographs are available for comparison.
     
     There is a small left apical pneumothorax present. A large cavitary mass is
     present in the left upper lobe, measuring approximately 8.7 x 8.6 cm in
     diameter. There is associated fullness of the left hilum and aorticopulmonary
     window region. The heart is mildly enlarged. The lungs demonstrate patchy
     opacification at the left lung base. No pleural effusions are evident but the
     right costophrenic sulcus has been excluded from the study.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Small left apical pneumothorax.
     2. Large cavitary left apical lung mass with adjacent areas of lymphadenopathy
     in the left hilum and possibly the AP window. These findings are concerning
     for cavitary lung cancer.

Admission Date:  [**3312-2-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**3312-2-23**]

Date of Birth:   [**3225-8-23**]       Sex:  M

Service:  Thoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 86 year old male who
presented with persistent cough and right shoulder pain and
was found to have a left upper lobe on chest x-ray.  A
computerized tomography scan on [**3311-12-15**], confirmed
the presence of a 6 cm cavitary left upper lobe mass and
there was also question of a right hilar lymph node.  On
[**3312-1-27**], he underwent a mediastinoscopy after which
he was found to have a resectable left lung tumor.  At this
time he was admitted for resection of the left upper lobe
mass.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Status post radiation therapy eight
years ago for prostate cancer, mild hypertension, 2.4 cm
abdominal aortic aneurysm.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 81 mg twice weekly.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Married, retired with 30 year history of
smoking two packs per day, quit 30 years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, well-appearing in no
apparent distress.  Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Heart, regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen, soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Extremities, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Neurologically intact.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the day of this admission, he underwent
a left upper lobectomy and resection of the chest wall
overlying the tumor which included segments of ribs 2, 3 and
4.  He tolerated the procedure well, but secondary to a very
difficult intubation he was kept intubated over night
immediately postoperatively and was therefore in the
Intensive Care Unit for 24 hours.  The next morning he
extubated with no difficulty and after that his course is
summarized as follows.

1.  Neurological - His pain was initially controlled with an
epidural and then was well controlled on p.o. pain
medication.  He did present with slight confusion early
postoperatively but was back to his baseline mental status
with no neurological deficits thereafter and this was
attributed to postoperative delirium and narcotics.

2.  Cardiovascular - He remained stable postoperatively and
required no additional medications.  Due to slight
bradycardia early postoperatively, he was not started on any
beta blockade perioperatively.

3.  Respiratory - He remained stable with good saturations
initially with some oxygen later on room air.  Chest tubes
were removed on postoperative day #5.  Chest x-ray
demonstrated good inflation of the remaining segment of the
left lung with a small residual space.  Prior to discharge he
is comfortable and his saturations were 97% on room air.

4.  Gastrointestinal - His diet was advanced as tolerated and
he tolerated that with no difficulty.

5.  Genitourinary - His urine output was good at all times
and renal function was maintained.  He had no difficulty
voiding after the Foley catheter was removed.

6.  Heme - He remained stable and required no blood products
during the hospitalization.  His hematocrit on [**3312-2-19**], postoperatively was 32.9.

7.  Infectious disease - There were no active issues.  He was
covered with Cefazolin perioperatively which was continued
for a few days after surgery and he will stop with discharge.
He remained afebrile with a normal white count and his wound
was healing well.

8.  Musculoskeletal - Activity was gradually advanced with
the assistance of physical therapy.  It was felt that he will
benefit from a short stay in a rehabilitation facility to
assist him to get back to baseline activities.

He is discharged in stable condition to a rehabilitation
facility with the following recommendations:

1.  Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 682**] as scheduled, see discharge
sheet.
2.  Continue current medications, again as summarized in the
discharge sheet and including Percocet prn for pain, Colace
100 mg p.o. b.i.d. as long as taking pain medications,
Albuterol inhaler 2 puffs every 6 hours prn.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Left lung tumor, status post left upper
lobectomy with chest wall resection.

     apical pneumothorax.  The heart and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  The
     pulmonary vascularity is stable.  The remainder of the lungs are otherwise
     unchanged.  There is incidental note of several metallic densities overlying
     the right base, which may reflect prior surgery.

     PA AND LATERAL CHEST:  Comparison is made to prior study dated [**3312-2-19**].  As
     before, there is marked subcutaneous emphysema in the soft tissues of the left
     chest.  In fact, they appear to be increased from prior study.  The left
     basilar pneumothorax is still present and unchanged.  Because of the overlying
     soft tissue emphysema, I cannot assess whether there is an apical
