Ventricular premature complexes 
Nonspecific lateral ST-T wave changes 
Since previous tracing of [**2553-7-21**], atrial flutter now absent 
.  
[**7-21**] cxr: No change. Failure persists.
.
[**7-16**] arteriogram of mesenteric vessels: Aortogram and selective 
arteriography of the celiac axis, superior mesenteric artery, 
and inferior mesenteric artery demonstrated no evidence of 
active hemorrhage.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
1. GIB/hemorrhagic shock:  Patient received significant fluid 
rehydration and 8 units PRBC in the ED. NG lavage performed in 
the ED was negative with repoorted bilious return, however, in 
the setting of elevated [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] upper GI source of bleeding 
could not be definitively ruled out.  She also had a negatibve 
mesenteric angiogram. GI deferred on scoping her in the ED 
secondary to demand ischemia with EKG changes, and once the 
patient was admitted to the MICU, was hemodynamically stable 
with stable serial hct x >72 hours. Patient ultimately received 
EGD and colonscopy on [**2553-7-20**] and these studies were negative for 
acute bleed.  She was maintained with 2 large bore IVs, as well 
as on IV PPIs, though subsequent transfusions were not required. 
 Hct on day of discharge was 37.2 and BP remained stable on 
metoprolol, baseline 90-120/40-70s. On the floor, the pt had 
intermittent occult blood in the stool alternating w/ OB 
negative stools. The pt did not have melena. The hematocrit has 
been stable leading up to discharge. GI re-evaluated the pt and 
elected not to rescope the patient given the minimal OB negative 
stools with clinical stability and asymptomatic pt. 
.
2. Patient was intubated in the ED for respiratory failure with 
decreased oxygen saturations. Unclear of specific etiology, 
though blood gas on admit to the ICU was 7.34/36/468/22.  In ED, 
pt was acutely anemic as well severely hypovolemic, and it was 
postulated that given her subsequent clinical improvement and 
extubation on HD 2 that initial hypoxemia was secondary to 
technical limitations of oxygen saturation monitor.  CXR in ED 
was at baseline. The pt did well after extubation and after 
treatment of her CHF w/ aggressive diuresis, the pt was weaned 
to an oxygen requirement of 0.5 liters by nasal cannula.
.
3. Leukocytosis: Likely represented acute demargination in 
setting of GIB; WBC normalized over subsequent days. Pt had no 
clinical signs or source of infection as CXR and UA were 
negative. later in her course, she developed a right sided 
facial swelling (see below) and leukocytosis.
.
4. Atrial fibrillation: Patient not maintained on coumadin or 
beta-blocker as outpatient for uncertain reasons.  INR 0n 
[**2553-7-17**] was 1.2.  Pt intermittently would be in atrial 
fibrillation, though throughout these episodes, was 
hemodynamically stable and would spontaneously convert to NSR.  
In the setting of demand ischemia from GIB with EKG change, she 
was started and maintained on metoprolol. Her metoprolol was 
titrated up to 75mg po tid and then down to 50mg po tid, which 
maintained her most often in nsr though often with conversion to 
hemodynamically stable afib. By the time of d/c the pt had been 
on metoprolol 50mgpo tid for >4 days and stable.
. 
5. Demand ischemia: Elevated troponins w/ new ST depression in 
V2-V6 on EKG in ED. Subsequent EKGs showed normalization of 
these changes, and serial cardiac enzymes trended down. Pt 
started on metoprolol as indicated. ASA contraindicated in 
setting of GIB. The pt had no cardiac symptoms and did well 
during her hospital course.
.
6. ARF: Likely prerenal in etiology given acute bleeding and 
shock. FENa calculated at 0.9%. Pt had adequate response to IVF 
and creatinine trended to baseline of 0.8. Her creatinine 
trended up slightly toward the end of her hospitalization.
.
7. Intermittent hypernatremia: Pt developed intermittent 
hypernatremia during her course secondary to rapid and 
aggressive IVF resuscitation which was corrected with IV free 
water. 
.
8. Parotid abscesses: right facial swelling was noted on day 1 
on the floor. A neck CT noted that she had many small abscesses. 
The pt was treated with clindamycin x 21 days (PCN allergic) 
which nearly completely resolved her symptoms.
.
9. UTI: she had a growth of >100,000 cfu sensitive to 
levofloxacin. The pt was tx'd for 7 days with cipro and 
resolution.
.
10. The pt had a left arm infiltrate that was cultured and 
returned MRSA. The pt was tx'd w/ 1 day of vancomycin and deemed 
not to need further tx as the area never was particularly red, 
swollen, hot, or painful.

Take all medications as prescribed. Do not take naprosyn, 
aspirin or ibuprofen until [**Doctor First Name **] see your doctor again with proper 
follow up. Also, follow the instructions provided below about 
gastrointestinal bleeding.
.
GASTROINTESTINAL BLEEDING 
WHAT [**Doctor First Name **] SHOULD KNOW: 
Gastrointestinal (gas-troh-in-TES-ti-nal) bleeding may happen 
when [**Doctor First Name **] have another disease or condition. Gastrointestinal 
(GI) bleeding can occur anywhere in your esophagus 
(e-SOF-ah-[**Male First Name (un) **]), stomach, and the large and small intestines 
(in-TES-tins). It is important to find and treat the cause of 
your bleeding, even if it stops on its own. The cause of your 
bleeding may be a [**Last Name 11706**] problem. GI bleeding can also be a sign 
of a more serious condition.

INSTRUCTIONS: 
Your medicines are: see your list. 
Keep a written list of the medicines [**Doctor First Name **] take, the dose, and 
when and why [**Doctor First Name **] take them. Bring the list of your medicines or 
the pill bottles when [**Doctor First Name **] see your caregivers. Learn why [**Doctor First Name **] 
take each medicine. Ask your caregiver for information about 
your medicine. 
There are many medicines that may cause GI bleeding. Do not take 
any medicines, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, herbs, or food 
supplements without first talking to caregivers. Do not take any 
medicine that has aspirin, naproxen, or ibuprofen in it without 
first asking your caregivers.
Always take your medicine as directed by caregivers. Call your 
caregiver if [**Doctor First Name **] think your medicines are not helping, or if [**Doctor First Name **] 
feel [**Doctor First Name **] are having side effects. Do not quit taking your 
medicines until [**Doctor First Name **] discuss it with your caregiver. If [**Doctor First Name **] are 
taking antibiotics (an-ti-[**Hospital1 **]-AH-tiks), take them until they are 
all gone even if [**Doctor First Name **] feel better.
If [**Doctor First Name **] are taking medicine that makes [**Doctor First Name **] drowsy, do not drive 
or use heavy equipment.
If [**Doctor First Name **] have other medical conditions such as high blood 
pressure, [**Doctor First Name **] need to control them. Take medicines as directed. 
Some medical conditions may increase your risk of GI bleeding, 
especially if they are not well-controlled. 
When is my next doctor's appointment? Call your caregiver in  
days to schedule a follow-up visit. Write down questions [**Doctor First Name **] 
have about your illness and how it is treated. This way [**Doctor First Name **] will 
remember to ask these questions during your next visit.

Activity: 
Do not lift anything heavier than 5 pounds. 
How can I live a healthy lifestyle? Living a more healthy 
lifestyle may decrease your risk of having GI bleeding in the 
future. Ask your caregiver about things [**Doctor First Name **] can do to decrease 
your bleeding risk. 
Alcohol: Ask your caregiver if [**Doctor First Name **] should stop drinking alcohol 
or decrease the amount of alcohol [**Doctor First Name **] drink. Drinking too much 
alcohol can damage your brain, heart, and liver. Drinking 
alcohol can also make your illness worse. 
Constipation: If [**Doctor First Name **] are constipated, [**Doctor First Name **] may have a hard time 
having a bowel movement (BM) Do not try to push the BM out if it 
is too hard. Walking is the best way to get your bowels moving. 
Eat foods high in fiber to make it easier to have a BM. Good 
examples are high fiber cereals, beans, vegetables, and whole 
grain breads. Prune juice may help make the BM softer. 
Caregivers may give [**Doctor First Name **] fiber medicine or a stool softener to 
help make your BMs softer and more regular. [**Doctor First Name 10**] can also buy 
these medicines at a grocery or drug store. 
Diet: Ask your caregiver if [**Doctor First Name **] need to be on a special diet. 
Drink six to eight cups of liquid each day. Follow your 
caregiver's advice if [**Doctor First Name **] must limit the amount of liquid [**Doctor First Name **] 
drink. decrease the amount of caffeine [**Doctor First Name **] eat and drink. 
Caffeine may be found in coffee, tea, soda, sports drinks, 
chocolate, and food bars.
Quit smoking: It is never too late to quit smoking. Smoking 
harms the heart, lungs, and the blood. [**Doctor First Name 10**] are more likely to 
have a heart attack, lung disease, and cancer if [**Doctor First Name **] smoke. [**Doctor First Name 10**] 
will help yourself and those around [**Doctor First Name **] by not smoking. Ask your 
caregiver for more information about how to stop smoking if [**Doctor First Name **] 
are having trouble quitting.

      [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with LGIB                                                     
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      bleeding site                                                                   
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Bright red blood per rectum, hemodynamically unstable, suspected
     lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3134**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3127**], and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 42**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 42**] was
     present throughout the procedure and supervising.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 43**] [**Name (STitle) 44**] reviewed
     the exam.
     
     PROCEDURE:  After appropriate consent was obtained, the patient was placed
     supine on the angiographic table.  Under fluoroscopy, the site of arterial
     entry was identified over the right femoral head and a 19-gauge single-wall
     needle was entered into the right common femoral artery.  [**Last Name (un) 223**] wire was
     advanced via the needle under fluoroscopic guidance into the abdominal aorta.
     The needle was then exchanged for a C2 glide catheter.  The wire was removed
     and a selective catheterization of the SMA was performed.  SMA selective
     angiography demonstrated no evidence of contrast extravasation or
     arteriovenous shunting.  Vessels in the distribution of SMA had normal
     morphology.  Next the catheter was exchanged for a SOS Omni Flush catheter
     which was positioned at the level of L3.  Aortogram was performed and
     demonstrated inferior mesenteric artery at the level of L4.  The SOS Omni
     Flush catheter was exchanged for a SOS catheter over the wire and selective
     catheterization of the inferior mesenteric artery was performed.  Selective
     angiography of the inferior mesenteric artery demonstrated normal morphology
     of the vessels, no contrast extravasation, and no arteriovenous shunting.  The
     catheter was placed selectively into the celiac axis and selective angiography
     of the celiac axis was performed.  The angiography demonstrated normal
     morphology of the vessels, no contrast extravasation, and no arteriovenous
     shunting.  The catheter was then removed and the angiographic sheath was
     pulled on the table.  Manual pressure was applied to the site of arterial
     entry until complete hemostasis was achieved.  The patient was transferred to
     the medical ICU in stable condition.

     present throughout the procedure and supervising.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 43**] [**Name (STitle) 44**] reviewed
     the exam.
     
     PROCEDURE:  After appropriate consent was obtained, the patient was placed
     supine on the angiographic table.  Under fluoroscopy, the site of arterial
     entry was identified over the right femoral head and a 19-gauge single-wall
     needle was entered into the right common femoral artery.  [**Last Name (un) 223**] wire was
     advanced via the needle under fluoroscopic guidance into the abdominal aorta.
     The needle was then exchanged for a C2 glide catheter.  The wire was removed
     and a selective catheterization of the SMA was performed.  SMA selective
     angiography demonstrated no evidence of contrast extravasation or
     arteriovenous shunting.  Vessels in the distribution of SMA had normal
     morphology.  Next the catheter was exchanged for a SOS Omni Flush catheter
     which was positioned at the level of L3.  Aortogram was performed and
     demonstrated inferior mesenteric artery at the level of L4.  The SOS Omni
     Flush catheter was exchanged for a SOS catheter over the wire and selective
     catheterization of the inferior mesenteric artery was performed.  Selective
     angiography of the inferior mesenteric artery demonstrated normal morphology
     of the vessels, no contrast extravasation, and no arteriovenous shunting.  The
     catheter was placed selectively into the celiac axis and selective angiography
     of the celiac axis was performed.  The angiography demonstrated normal
     morphology of the vessels, no contrast extravasation, and no arteriovenous
     shunting.  The catheter was then removed and the angiographic sheath was
     pulled on the table.  Manual pressure was applied to the site of arterial
     entry until complete hemostasis was achieved.  The patient was transferred to
     the medical ICU in stable condition.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Bright red blood per rectum, hemodynamically unstable, suspected
     lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3134**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3127**], and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 42**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 42**] was
     present throughout the procedure and supervising.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 43**] [**Name (STitle) 44**] reviewed
     the exam.
     
     PROCEDURE:  After appropriate consent was obtained, the patient was placed
     supine on the angiographic table.  Under fluoroscopy, the site of arterial
     entry was identified over the right femoral head and a 19-gauge single-wall
     needle was entered into the right common femoral artery.  [**Last Name (un) 223**] wire was
     advanced via the needle under fluoroscopic guidance into the abdominal aorta.
     The needle was then exchanged for a C2 glide catheter.  The wire was removed
     and a selective catheterization of the SMA was performed.  SMA selective
     angiography demonstrated no evidence of contrast extravasation or
     arteriovenous shunting.  Vessels in the distribution of SMA had normal
     morphology.  Next the catheter was exchanged for a SOS Omni Flush catheter
     which was positioned at the level of L3.  Aortogram was performed and
     demonstrated inferior mesenteric artery at the level of L4.  The SOS Omni
     Flush catheter was exchanged for a SOS catheter over the wire and selective
     catheterization of the inferior mesenteric artery was performed.  Selective
     angiography of the inferior mesenteric artery demonstrated normal morphology
     of the vessels, no contrast extravasation, and no arteriovenous shunting.  The
     catheter was placed selectively into the celiac axis and selective angiography
     of the celiac axis was performed.  The angiography demonstrated normal
     morphology of the vessels, no contrast extravasation, and no arteriovenous
     shunting.  The catheter was then removed and the angiographic sheath was
     pulled on the table.  Manual pressure was applied to the site of arterial
     entry until complete hemostasis was achieved.  The patient was transferred to
     the medical ICU in stable condition.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      bleeding site

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Bright red blood per rectum, hemodynamically unstable, suspected
     lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3134**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3127**], and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 42**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 42**] was
     present throughout the procedure and supervising.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 43**] [**Name (STitle) 44**] reviewed
     the exam.
     
     PROCEDURE:  After appropriate consent was obtained, the patient was placed
     supine on the angiographic table.  Under fluoroscopy, the site of arterial
     entry was identified over the right femoral head and a 19-gauge single-wall
     needle was entered into the right common femoral artery.  [**Last Name (un) 223**] wire was
     advanced via the needle under fluoroscopic guidance into the abdominal aorta.
     The needle was then exchanged for a C2 glide catheter.  The wire was removed
     and a selective catheterization of the SMA was performed.  SMA selective
     angiography demonstrated no evidence of contrast extravasation or
     arteriovenous shunting.  Vessels in the distribution of SMA had normal
     morphology.  Next the catheter was exchanged for a SOS Omni Flush catheter
     which was positioned at the level of L3.  Aortogram was performed and
     demonstrated inferior mesenteric artery at the level of L4.  The SOS Omni
     Flush catheter was exchanged for a SOS catheter over the wire and selective
     catheterization of the inferior mesenteric artery was performed.  Selective
     angiography of the inferior mesenteric artery demonstrated normal morphology
     of the vessels, no contrast extravasation, and no arteriovenous shunting.  The
     catheter was placed selectively into the celiac axis and selective angiography
     of the celiac axis was performed.  The angiography demonstrated normal
     morphology of the vessels, no contrast extravasation, and no arteriovenous
     shunting.  The catheter was then removed and the angiographic sheath was
     pulled on the table.  Manual pressure was applied to the site of arterial
     entry until complete hemostasis was achieved.  The patient was transferred to
     the medical ICU in stable condition.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Aortogram and selective arteriography of the celiac axis,
                                                                 (Over)

     AP CHEST 11:28 A.M.:
     
     HISTORY:  Check tube placement.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
     
     Tip of the ET tube is at the thoracic inlet, approximately 5 cm from the
     carina, in standard positioning.  A nasogastric tube passes into the stomach
     and out of view.  There is a roughly 6 cm wide lobulated opacity extending
     superiorly from the upper pole of the right hilus that could be tortuous
     vessels in the mediastinum but is concerning for a lung mass or dense
     consolidation. Another nearly 3 cm wide opacity extending laterally from the
     lower pole of the hilus could be pneumonia or atelectasis in the middle lobe.
     When feasible, routine radiographs should be obtained.  Heart is mildly
     enlarged.
     
     The lateral aspect of the left hemithorax is excluded from the examination.
     There is no right pleural abnormality.  There is severe degenerative change
     and probable old fracture deformity of the right humerus.
     
     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7753**] and I discussed these findings at the time of this dictation.

     HISTORY:  Right parotid tenderness and a loose third tooth with poor dental
     hygiene.  Elevated white blood cell count.  Evaluate for periapical abscess
     versus parotid abscess versus continuous lesion.
     
     COMPARISON:  No previous studies.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial multidetector CT images of the neck were obtained with 100
     cc of intravenous Optiray.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is pronounced swelling and inflammatory fat stranding in the
     right submandibular, parotid, and masticator spaces.  There is enlargement and
     hyperenhancement of the right submandibular and parotid glands relative to the
     left.  There is a 15x5 mm area of decreased enhancement in the inferior
     portion of the parotid gland, and a 9x2 mm area of decreased enhancement in
     the right masseter muscle, poorly characterized due to overlying dental
     artifact, which may represent tiny developing abscesses. Evaluation of the
     mandibular and maxillary teeth is limited by artifact related to dental
     hardware.  There is no obvious peridental abscess. The pharyngeal airway is
     slightly displaced to the left with no significant narrowing.
     
     The right common carotid artery courses medially at the level of the larynx,
     and ascends in retropharyngeal location, which represents an anatomic variant.
     The right lobe of the thyroid gland demonstrates mild retrotracheal extent.  A

      swelling and inflammation involving the right submandibular, parotid, and
      masticator spaces; 15 x 5 mm area of low density in inferior parotid gland and
      9 x 2 mm area of low attenuation in right masseter which are too small to
      characterize but may represent tiny developing abscesses; dental evaluation is
      limited by artifact but no obvious dental abscess is seen - correlate with
      direct visualization
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Right parotid tenderness and a loose third tooth with poor dental
     hygiene.  Elevated white blood cell count.  Evaluate for periapical abscess
     versus parotid abscess versus continuous lesion.
     
     COMPARISON:  No previous studies.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial multidetector CT images of the neck were obtained with 100
     cc of intravenous Optiray.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is pronounced swelling and inflammatory fat stranding in the
     right submandibular, parotid, and masticator spaces.  There is enlargement and
     hyperenhancement of the right submandibular and parotid glands relative to the
     left.  There is a 15x5 mm area of decreased enhancement in the inferior
     portion of the parotid gland, and a 9x2 mm area of decreased enhancement in
     the right masseter muscle, poorly characterized due to overlying dental
     artifact, which may represent tiny developing abscesses. Evaluation of the
     mandibular and maxillary teeth is limited by artifact related to dental
     hardware.  There is no obvious peridental abscess. The pharyngeal airway is
     slightly displaced to the left with no significant narrowing.
     
     The right common carotid artery courses medially at the level of the larynx,
     and ascends in retropharyngeal location, which represents an anatomic variant.
     The right lobe of the thyroid gland demonstrates mild retrotracheal extent.  A
                                                                 (Over)

Events: At change of shift pt. was c/o awaiting rehab bed. At around 2000 pt. converted from SR/ST into AFib. by 2130 pt's heart rate was 140's to 150's ASYMPTOMATIC. 12 lead EKG done and total of 5mg lopressor IVP given with poor result and drop of SBP into the 60's. 1000cc NS bolus given. When bolus completed, pt's heart rate remained 130s-140s and urine output was decreasing. Breath sounds became coarse with crackles, respirations appeared labored and rate in 30's. CXR done showing fluid. 30mg lasix given with fair result. Heart rate returned to 90s's to low 100's after 0.25mg dig given. Pt, now appears to be flipping from ST to AFib.

Neuro: Pt. confused. Alert to self and place at times. MAE. Pupils equal and reactive. Pt. getting OOB to chair

CVS: At this time pt. in AFib. SBP low 100's. Pulsus palpable with doppler. 3+ pitting edema throughout trunk and extremities. T-Max 99.3

Resp: Pt. remains on 2L NC with sats >95%. Breath sounds coarse bilat. Diminished in bases. 

GI: Pt. remains NPO except meds. EGD/colonoscopy done yesterday. No bleeding found. Abd. soft/distended. BS + No BM this shift.

     PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 7761**] [**Doctor Last Name 3127**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6**], Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 6**], the attending radiologist, being present and supervising.  The right
     upper arm was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Since no suitable
     superficial veins were visible.  ultrasound was used for localization of a
     suitable vein.  The right basilic vein was patent and compressive.
     
     Local anesthesia with 1% Lidocaine, the basilic vein was entered under
     ultrasonographic guidance with a 21 gauge single.  A 0.018 guide wire was
     advanced through the needle into the superior vena cava.  Based on the
     markers on the guidewire, it was determined that a length of 30 cm would be
     suitable. The PICC line was trimmed to length and advanced over a 4 French
     sheath under fluoroscopic guidance into the superior vena cava. The sheath was
     removed. Catheter was flushed.  A final chest radiograph was obtained
     demonstrating the tip of the catheter to be within the SVC.  The line is ready
     for use. Ultrasound images before and after placement of a line demonstrate
     patency of the left basilic vein.  The statlock was applied and the line was
     heplocked.

     Today's film was obtained in the supine positioning.  Allowing for differences
     in technique, there is likely mild to moderate CHF, slightly worsened since
     the prior study.  There is also an increased opacity in the right lower lobe
     consistent with atelectasis or infiltrate.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Film limited by supine positioning.  Likely increased CHF and
     worsening right lower lobe infiltrate or atelectasis.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with fall, cough                                              
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      eval for infiltrate

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Fall and cough, evaluate for infiltrate.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2553-7-21**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest.
     
     FINDINGS:  Heart size is within normal limits.  Since the previous
     examination, there is a new 3.3 cm rounded opacity at the left hilum
     consistent with a hilar mass.  Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar
     atelectasis are noted.  Additional note is made of severe degenerative changes
     at the glenohumeral joints bilaterally.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1)  3.3 cm left hilar mass.  Contrast enhanced chest CT is
     recommended for further evaluation.
     
     2)  Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
     
     Results were called to patient's listed PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 7769**], at 2 PM on
     [**2554-5-15**] as the ED resident, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7770**], caring for the patient was
     unavailable.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7769**] no longer sees this patient as she is now located
     at [**Hospital **] Rehab.  An email was therefore sent to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 7771**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7772**] of the ED to
     communicate the finding of left hilar mass and recommendation for CT.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with a fall and head trauma, evaluate for
     bleed.
     
     No prior studies are available for comparison.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT scan.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of the
     normally midline structures, or major vascular territorial infarct.  The [**Doctor Last Name 30**]-
     white matter differentiation is preserved.  There are periventricular white
     matter hypodensities consistent with chronic microvascular infarction. An
     ovoid 5-mm hypodensity in the left basal ganglia likely represents an old
     lacunar infarction.  There are age-appropriate involutional changes.  There is
     a right parietal subgaleal hematoma.  The osseous structures are unremarkable.
     There is mild mucosal thickening of the ethmoid air cells.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  No hemorrhage or mass effect.
     
     2.  Chronic ischemic disease.
     
     3.  Right parietal subgaleal hematoma.
