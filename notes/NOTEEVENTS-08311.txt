     TRAUMA #2 (AP CXR & PELVIS PORT)                                Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 6814**]
     Reason: TRAUMA
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     INDICATION:  51-year-old man with trauma.
     
     CHEST AND PELVIC RADIOGRAPH:  There is no comparison.  The evaluation is
     somewhat limited due to overlying trauma board artifact.  The heart is normal
     in size.  Mediastinum appears slightly prominent especially on the right,
     however, this can be due to positioning.  Note is made of increased
     interstitial markings bilaterally, especially on the right, with increased
     vascular markings. There is opacity in the right lower lobe continuous from
     the hilum.
     
     The evaluation of pelvis is limited due to trauma board artifact.  Note is
     made of residual contrast in the bladder.  No gross diastasis or fracture is
     noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Increased interstitial markings and vascular markings bilaterally,
     especially on the right, with opacity in the right lower lobe, continuous from
     the right hilum.  The finding is consistent with the given history of right
     hilar lung cancer, and interstitial markings may represent lymphangitic spread
     versus CHF or volume overload.  The presence of contusion cannot be totally
     excluded in the setting of trauma.  No gross fracture or diastasis.  Faint
     pleural opacity on the right, which may represent small effusion.  The finding
     was discussed with the trauma team in person.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  51-year-old man status post motor vehicle accident, left-sided
     weakness.
     
     HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage.  No mass
     effect.  No shift of normally midline structures.  Note is made of subtle
     equivocal hypodensity in the white matter of left temporal lobe, although the
     location does not match the clinical finding. Basilar artery at the level of
     skull base is somewhat hyperdense, measuring 70 [**Doctor Last Name **], which can be due to
     artifact or residual contrast in this patient who received IV contrast at OSH
     on the same day, however, thrombosis or dissection in this area is another
     possibility. There is 1.2 x 0.8 cm calcified oval- shaped region right to the
     cavernous sinus, probably representing calcified aneurysm.
     
     Note is made of mucous retention cyst in right maxillary sinus, as well as
     mucosal thickening in bilateral maxillary and ethmoid sinuses.  No fracture is
     noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
     
     2.  Hyperdensity in the basilar artery at the level of skull base, which can
     be due to artifact or residual contrast, however, thrombosis or dissection
     cannot be excluded.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4315**] 
Chief Complaint:
Status-post MVA.
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.
 
History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 62 year-old gentleman with stage IV lung cancer with 
bone metatases who presented after being found wandering at the 
site of his recent automobile crash.  He was apparently driving 
and crashed his car.  He was then picked up when passersby saw 
him wandering.  His wife states that he was normal this morning 
when he dropped her at work.  He then went to an appointment at 
[**Hospital3 2353**] for XRT.  His wife talked to him at home at ~3 pm 
and says he was not acting normally at that time.  He sounded 
not like himself on the phone.  He was then supposed to be 
picking her up at ~5 pm.  He left the house at 4:15 and she 
thinks he must have had the accident at ~4:30.  The location of 
his accident was strange she reports, as this would not be on 
his route to pick her up.

He was brought from the scene to [**Hospital 51**] Hospital where he was 
found to have left facial and left sided weakness arm>leg.  He 
was awake.  Head CT was read as unremarkable.  CT of the abdomen 
showed a splenic laceration.  He was then sent here.  These 
scans were at ~6pm.  He received IV contrast after the head CT 
for the abdominal CT.  Here, a CT scan was repeated which showed 
a question of a basilar artery hyperdensity over the pons (but 
this was post-contrast). On review of prior CT at OSH before 
contrast, this area is somewhat motion degraded but does appear 
slightly bright.  At this point, the option of iaTPA was raised, 
but there were several problems. First of all, we did not have 
an accurate time of onset. Second, he has a splenic laceration 
and was recently in a traumatic MVA.  This was the most 
concerning possible contraindication for lysis.  The admitting 
trauma team called their attending who told them he did not want 
to pursue thrombolysis no matter what the concern for basilar 
thrombosis given the high possibility that he would bleed from 
his spleen which could be fatal.  Next, the pt had received a CT 
contrast load several hours earlier and has a Cr=1.2.  In 
addition, it was discovered that he has a shellfish 
allergy(although he did fine with first contrast load).  Given 
the fact that the trauma attending did not want to pursue 
thrombolysis, the patient was put in for an MRA/I to assess his 
vessels as the need for hyperacute scanning along with the risks 
of a CTA in this pt were diminished given the fact that not 
thrombolysis would be pursued per admitting team.  This was then 
discussed with the stroke fellow who felt that an acute scan 
should be performed given the high morbidity from a basilar 
artery thrombosis.  The surgical team felt differently and 
strongly that a CTA should not be performed given the risks and 
lack of thrombolysis to be performed.  A discussion was held and 
in the end, the pt was slotted to get an urgent partial MRI DWI 
and MRA to answer the question of whether the basilar was truly 
occluded.  This would only add ~10 minutes to the process as the 
CT scanner was in use by a trauma patient.  The patient's exam 
was suggestive of a right-sided stroke, but he had a significant 
left neglect.

BRAIN MRI:
There is an area of slow diffusion seen in the right basal 
ganglia extending to the corona radiata. There are also areas of 
increased signal seen on diffusion images in the right frontal 
lobe and in the watershed distribution and small areas of 
hyperintensity are seen in the left occipital lobe and both 
cerebellar hemispheres. The basal ganglia abnormality 
demonstrate low signal on ADC map. However, other abnormalities 
are small and no definite low ADCs identified in these regions 
which may suggest T2 shine-through. There is no mass effect or 
midline shift seen. No hemorrhage is identified.
IMPRESSION: Acute right MCA infarct. Small areas of increased 
signal in both cerebellar region on diffusion images could be 
due to T2 shine-through, but given the small size acute infarcts 
could not be excluded. Increased signal seen on diffusion images 
in the right frontal lobe appears to be due to chronic infarct. 
No mass effect is seen.

MRA OF THE HEAD:
The head MRA demonstrates occlusion of the right middle cerebral 
artery near the bifurcation. The left ICA shows demonished flow 
signal with narrowing of the supraclinoid portion indicatinve of 
intrinsic atherosclerotic disease. The remaining arteries of 
anterior and posterior circulation are somewhat tortuous but 
patent. No stenosis is seen. There is hypoplastic A1 segment of 
the left anterior cerebral artery, which could be a normal 
variation.
IMPRESSION: Occlusion of M1 segment of the right middle cerebral 
artery.
Narrowing of supraclinoid left ICA.

MRA NECK W&W/O CONTRAST; MR CONTRAST GADOLIN
FINDINGS: The right carotids show a somewhat tortuous appearance 
but no evidence of stenosis is seen. Both vertebral arteries 
demonstrate normal flow signal without stenosis or occlusion.
The left common carotid artery is small in caliber and 
demonstrates lower flow signal compared to the right side. There 
appears to be low position of the left carotid bifurcation. The 
left internal carotid artery is small in size which could be due 
to high-grade stenosis the origin. Since the MRA is somewhat 
limited by motion, further evaluation of the left carotid can be 
obtained with CT angiography if clinically indicated. The CT 
angiography can also help for further evaluation of great 
vessels of the thoracic outlet which are not visualized on the 
MRA.
IMPRESSION: Somewhat tortuous but normal vertebrals and right 
internal carotid arteries. Deminished flow signal caliber of 
left carotid due to high grade stenosis at the origin. For 
better assessment, CTA would help. No evidence of acute 
dissection on the fat-suppressed axial images of the neck and 
MRA of the neck.

MRI CERVICAL SPINE
No evidence of ligamentous disruption seen. Subtle increased 
signal in T1 and possibly in T2 vertebral bodies could be 
secondary to marrow edema from trauma. Changes of cervical 
spondylosis are noted with minimal extrinsic indentation on the 
spinal cord at C3-4 level by disc bulging. No evidence of 
intraspinal hematoma seen.

CT OF THE THORACIC SPINE WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: T1 through T12 are 
visualized. There is a wedge deformity of the T12 vertebral body 
with associated cortical defects suggestive that this is an 
acute wedge fracture. The T12 ring is intact. No definite 
metastatic lesions are identified within T12. The remainder of 
the thoracic vertebral body heights are preserved. The thoracic 
disc spaces are preserved. There is no evidence of 
spondylolisthesis. There are moderate degenerative changes with 
anterior osteophytes at multiple levels. Mild endplate sclerotic 
change is noted at T11/12 and T7/8. The neural foramina are 
patent, and there is no evidence of encroachment upon the spinal 
cord. A 1.5-cm lytic lesion of the T10 vertebral body is 
consistent with metastatic disease. The visualized portion of 
the lungs demonstrates [**Hospital1 **]- apical consolidation, worse on the 
right.
IMPRESSION:
1. Wedge compression fracture of T12 may be acute. T12 ring is 
intact. No definite metastatic lesions identified within T12.
2. 1.5-cm lytic focus of the T10 vertebral body consistent with 
metastatic disease.
3. Incompletely imaged on this spine CT is [**Hospital1 **]-apical 
consolidation, worse on the right.

CT OF THE LUMBAR SPINE WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There are six 
non-rib-bearing lumbar vertebral bodies. There is preservation 
of the lumbar vertebral body heights and disc spaces. There is 
no evidence of acute fracture or spondylolisthesis of the lumbar 
spine. AP alignment is preserved. The neural foramina are patent 
and there is no encroachment upon the spinal cord. There are 
multiple aggressive-appearing lytic lesions of the bilateral 
iliac bones and sacrum. The largest measures 3 x 2 cm and is 
located within the right ilium along the sacroiliac joint. There 
is significant destruction of the sacrum. These findings are 
consistent with metastatic disease. There are calcifications of 
the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries. The regional soft 
tissues are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute fracture or spondylolisthesis of the lumbar spine.
2. Multiple destructive lytic lesions of the sacrum and ilii 
consistent with metastatic disease.

TTE:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, 
cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). 
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. No masses or 
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is no aortic 
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid regurgitation jet is 
eccentric and may be underestimated. There is a 
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
1. Stroke: Further history after admission elucidated that the 
pt actually developed left-sided weakness prior to the 
automobile accident.  Neurologic examination on admission was 
notable for left facial droop and left sided hemiplegia. MRI of 
the brain on admission demonstrated acute right MCA infarct. MRA 
of the circle of [**Location (un) 345**] showed occlusion of M1 segment of the 
right middle cerebral artery. MRA of the neck vessels with fat 
sats demonstrated no evidence of dissection, but did demonstrate 
somewhat tortuous but normal vertebrals and right internal 
carotid arteries. Diminished flow signal caliber of left carotid 
due to high grade stenosis at the origin was also noted. TTE 
revealed no evidence of thrombus or focal hypokinesis. The pt 
was started on 325mg of ASA daily.  He was also started on fish 
oil (for hypercoagulable state due to underlying malignancy) 
statin for plaque stabilization.  Throughout the hospital stay, 
the pt remained encephalopathic but gradually improved.  The 
etiology underlying the encephalopathy was thought to be due to 
stroke location, pneumonia, and overuse of narcotic analgesics 
while in the intensive care unit. 

2. T12 compression fracture: Trauma work-up after the MVA 
demonstrated T12 compression fracture.  Discussion with the pt's 
oncologist and radiation oncologist revealed that this lesion 
had actually been receiving palliative radiation therapy, so 
likely represented a pathologic fracture. Ortho spine was 
consulted and recommended placing the pt in a TLSO brace when 
out of bed.

3. Splenic laceration: Noted on trauma work-up. Per trauma 
surgery, it was a grade I laceration and required no further 
intervention.  They commented that it was acceptable to use 
antiplatelet medications.

4. Metastatic lung cancer: Stage IV per the pt's oncologist.  He 
was in the midst of undergoing palliative XRT to bony metastases 
in the thoracic spine and sacrum.  This should be continued 
after transfer to rehab.

5. Right lung pneumonia: The pt was discovered to have right 
lung infiltrate on CXR. He was started on a ten day course of 
levofloxacin and metronidazole.  At the time of discharge, he 
was receiving day 3 of a 10 day course.

     TECHNIQUE:  2D time-of-flight MRA of the neck vessels acquired.  Following
     this, gadolinium MRA of the neck was obtained.  Gadolinium-enhanced MRA is
     somewhat limited by motion and venous contamination.
     
     FINDINGS:  The right carotids show a somewhat tortuous appearance but no
     evidence of stenosis is seen.  Both vertebral arteries demonstrate normal flow
     signal without stenosis or occlusion.
     
     The left common carotid artery is small in caliber and demonstrates lower flow
     signal compared to the right side. There appears to be low position of the
     left carotid bifurcation.  The left internal carotid artery is small in size
     which could be due to high-grade stenosis the origin.  Since the MRA is
     somewhat limited by motion, further evaluation of the left carotid can be
     obtained with CT angiography if clinically indicated.  The CT angiography can
     also help for further evaluation of great vessels of the thoracic outlet which
     are not visualized on the MRA.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Somewhat tortuous but normal vertebrals and right internal
     carotid arteries.   Deminished flow signal caliber of left carotid due to
     high grade stenosis at the origin. For better assessment, CTA would help. No
     evidence of acute dissection on the fat-suppressed axial images of the neck
     and MRA of the neck.

     62-year-old male with metastatic lung cancer, now status post motor vehicle
     collision and concern for traumatic spinal injury.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT continuously acquired axial images of the lumbar spine were
     obtained without IV contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were
     performed.
     
     CT OF THE LUMBAR SPINE WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There are six non-rib-bearing
     lumbar vertebral bodies.  There is preservation of the lumbar vertebral body
     heights and disc spaces.  There is no evidence of acute fracture or
     spondylolisthesis of the lumbar spine.  AP alignment is preserved.  The neural
     foramina are patent and there is no encroachment upon the spinal cord.  There
     are multiple aggressive-appearing lytic lesions of the bilateral iliac bones
     and sacrum.  The largest measures 3 x 2 cm and is located within the right
     ilium along the sacroiliac joint.  There is significant destruction of the
     sacrum.  These findings are consistent with metastatic disease.  There are
     calcifications of the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries. The regional soft
     tissues are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No acute fracture or spondylolisthesis of the lumbar spine.
     2.  Multiple destructive lytic lesions of the sacrum and ilii consistent with
     metastatic disease.

     62-year-old male with lung cancer and osseous metastases, now status post
     motor vehicle collision.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT continuously acquired axial images of the thoracic spine were
     obtained without IV contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were
     performed.
     
     CT OF THE THORACIC SPINE WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  T1 through T12 are visualized.
     There is a wedge deformity of the T12 vertebral body with associated cortical
     defects suggestive that this is an acute wedge fracture. The T12 ring is
     intact. No definite metastatic lesions are identified within T12. The
     remainder of the thoracic vertebral body heights are preserved.  The thoracic
     disc spaces are preserved.  There is no evidence of spondylolisthesis.  There
     are moderate degenerative changes with anterior osteophytes at multiple
     levels.  Mild endplate sclerotic change is noted at T11/12 and T7/8.  The
     neural foramina are patent, and there is no evidence of encroachment upon the
     spinal cord.  A 1.5-cm lytic lesion of the T10 vertebral body is consistent
     with metastatic disease.  The visualized portion of the lungs demonstrates [**Hospital1 **]-
     apical consolidation, worse on the right.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Wedge compression fracture of T12 may be acute.  T12 ring is intact.  No
     definite metastatic lesions identified within T12.
     2.  1.5-cm lytic focus of the T10 vertebral body consistent with metastatic
     disease.
     3.  Incompletely imaged on this spine CT is [**Hospital1 **]-apical consolidation, worse on
     the right.
     
     The results of this study were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 2 p.m. on [**4-27**], 2006.
     
     NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: the lung disease appears quite extensive, not
     confined to the apices, and there are bilateral pleural effusions.

     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with question of cervical spine trauma for
     further evaluation.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and gradient echo and T2
     images of the cervical spine were acquired.
     
     FINDINGS:  At the craniocervical junction and at C2-3, mild degenerative
     changes are noted.
     
     At C3-4, disc bulging and moderate narrowing of the right neural foramen is
     seen without spinal stenosis.
     
     At C4-5, disc and uncovertebral degenerative changes are seen with mild-to-
     moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis.  Mild disc bulging is seen.
     
     At C5-6, there is disc bulging with moderate left foraminal stenosis.
     
     At C6-7, disc bulging and bilateral mild foraminal stenosis is identified.
     
     From C7-T1 to T3-4, degenerative disc disease is identified without
     significant bulge or herniation.
     
     The spinal cord shows normal intrinsic signal.  Minimal extrinsic indentation
     on the spinal cord is seen by disc bulging at C3-4 level.
     
     The T1 and T2 vertebrae demonstrates slightly increased signal on inversion
     recovery images, which could be due to mild marrow edema from trauma.  The
     patient has fracture in the lower thoracic spine seen on the CT of the same
     day.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of ligamentous disruption seen.  Subtle increased
     signal in T1 and possibly in T2 vertebral bodies could be secondary to marrow
     edema from trauma.  Changes of cervical spondylosis are noted with minimal
     extrinsic indentation on the spinal cord at C3-4 level by disc bulging.  No
     evidence of intraspinal hematoma seen.

     MRI BRAIN AND MRA OF THE HEAD.
     
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with question of basal artery thrombosis, also
     may have right MCA stroke.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  T1 sagittal and FLAIR, T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial
     images of the brain were acquired.  3D time-of-flight MRA of the circle of
     [**Location (un) 220**] was obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:  BRAIN MRI:
     
     There is an area of slow diffusion seen in the right basal ganglia extending
     to the corona radiata.  There are also areas of increased signal seen on
     diffusion images in the right frontal lobe and in the watershed distribution
     and small areas of hyperintensity are seen in the left occipital lobe and both
     cerebellar hemispheres.  The basal ganglia abnormality  demonstrate low signal
     on ADC map.  However, other abnormalities are small and no definite low ADCs
     identified in these regions which may suggest T2 shine-through.  There is no
     mass effect or midline shift seen. No hemorrhage is identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Acute right MCA infarct.  Small areas of increased signal in both
     cerebellar region on diffusion images could be due to T2 shine-through, but
     given the small size acute infarcts could not be excluded.  Increased signal
     seen on diffusion images in the right frontal lobe appears to be due to
     chronic infarct.  No mass effect is seen.
     
     MRA OF THE HEAD:
     
     The head MRA demonstrates occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery near
     the bifurcation.  The left ICA shows demonished flow signal with
     narrowing of the supraclinoid portion indicatinve of intrinsic
     atherosclerotic disease. The remaining arteries of anterior and posterior
     circulation are somewhat tortuous but patent.  No stenosis is seen. There is
     hypoplastic A1 segment of the left anterior cerebral artery, which could be a

Neuro - Continues with Q1H neuro checks.  This am went for MRI c-spine, and CT T and L spine.  No results for either yet, waiting to go for MRA of neck to rule out arterial dissection.  Neuro stable throughout day.  Continually is A&O x3.  Follows commands, has begun to have some small movement of left side.  Right is normal strength, Left hand small hand movements, and left foot withdraws to stimulation.  Pupils PERRLA, resists opening Right eye, but not left.  Notable left sided weakness.  INtact cough and gag.  Continues on logroll precautions with c-collar in place, until final reads are back on scans.  [**Name8 (MD) **] MD's pt is to lay flat and not be in reverse T, for better blood flow and blood pressure in brain.  Chronic pain due to lung CA.  Medicated with 10mg morphine frequently for pain, with + results.

CV - HR 70-110 sinus rhythm, no ectopy noted.  BP by cuff 100-120 systolic.  + strong peripheral pulses, skin pink, warm, and dry.  Cycling cardiac enzymes and hematocrits.  Next due for both at 2000.  

Resp - Pt. recently diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer with mets to the bones.  Lungs with in/ex wheezes consistently.  Currently on 4lpm NC, needs frequent reminders to leave in place.  With o2, sats are 96-100%, on room air sats are 92-96%.  Denies shortness of breath.

GI - Abdomen soft, nt, nd.  + bowel sounds throughout.  Currently is written for sips, however TLS not cleared and pt cannot sit upright, and so remains NPO.  no BM.

GU - Foley draining clear yellow urine.  Dipped off in afternoon, currently receiving 500cc NS bolus for low urine output.

Endo - No order for finger sticks, however one checked was 110.
 
Id - Tmax 98.3 axillary, climbing through day.  Not currently on antibiotics.

Skin - Bilateral eyes with contusions, red/purple in color, no drainage.  Few small bumps and scrapes here and there.  Posterior WNL, not reddened.

Psych/social - Wife in for most of the day.  Other family here briefly.  Wife appropriate however glum.  Said it has been a hard time since he was diagnosed, only ~1 month ago.  At times when pt was anxious and fidgity wife had difficulty staying in the room and easily  became anxious herself.  However very supportive and concerned.  She spoke with neuromed team today.

A - s/p CVA with left hemiparesis.  Impaired physical mobility.  Acute on chronic pain.  Impaired skin integrity.  Impaired coping.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the NG tube placement.
     
     Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed without benefit of comparison to the
     prior films.
     
     FINDINGS:  The NG tube tip is in the stomach in standard position.  The heart
     size is normal.  Mediastinum has normal position, width and shape.
     
     There is entire right lung consolidation and left upper lobe consolidation,
     which might represent pneumonia.  Some other possibilities such as hemorrhage
     or asymmetric edema should also be considered, but in the absence of the
     enlarged heart and pleural effusion, the pulmonary edema is less likely.  For
     precise evaluation, additional clinical history and previous exams are
     necessary.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     Bilateral lung consolidatons as described most probably representing
     pneumonia.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Shortness of breath in a patient with known lung
     cancer.
     
     Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2741-4-29**].
     
     The patient's mediastinum has shifted markedly to the right.  On the current
     chest x-rays the right hemithorax is almost completely opacified with more
     prominent density in the lower portion of the right lung. Right pleural
     effusion has been enlarged and is loculated.  Giving the new history of the
     lung cancer, the above finding most probably represents almost complete
     atelectasis of the lung due to obstructing mass with pleural effusion.  The
     interstitial markings on the right are most probably related to the
     lymphangitic spread of the tumor. This information was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 354**]
     and further evaluation with chest CT was recommended.
     
     IMPRESSION: Complete opacification of right hemithorax  most probably
     represents  atelectasis of the lung due to obstructing mass with
     accompaning pleural effusion.

     INDICATIONS:  62-year-old man with known lung cancer, now with shortness of
     breath.  Evaluate for PE.
     
     No prior studies for comparison.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Continuous axial images of the chest were obtained before and
     after the administration of IV Optiray contrast.  Multiplanar reformatted
     images were also performed.
     
     CTA CHEST:  Multiple filling defects are seen in the left main as well as left
     upper and left lower lobe segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries. These
     are consistent with extensive pulmonary emboli. The aorta is unremarkable.
     There is a small pericardial effusion.  There are multiple pathologically
     enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.  For example, a large precarinal lymph node
     measures 14 mm, best seen on series 3, image 27.  An ill- defined right hilar
     mass compresses the upper lobe bronchus and nearly obliterates the right
     middle and right lower lobe bronchi, resulting in postobstructive atelectasis.
      There is a smaller poorly defined left hilar mass.  There is a large right
     sided pleural effusion. Parenchymal opacities are seen in the right lung.
     Multiple ill- defined nodular opacities are seen in the left upper and left
     lower lobes which may represent metastasis or infection.
     
     The visualized portions of the upper abdomen are unremarkable.
