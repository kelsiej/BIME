Pertinent Results:
Chest CT [**4-27**]: Penetrating ulcer of the descending thoracic 
aorta at the level of inferior pulmonary vein, surrounded by 
somewhat hyperdense soft tissue mass measuring 4.3 x 2.9 cm and 
50 [**Doctor Last Name **] on noncontrast scan, worrisome for mediastinal hematoma in 
the setting of underlying penetrating ulcer. Urgent clinical 
attention is needed. (Other possibility of the metiastinal soft 
tissue mass includes metastatic disease in this patient with 
history of renal cell carcinoma, or esophageal in origin. 
However, the soft tissue is most closely related to the aorta, 
and is asymmetrically located on the side of penetrating 
ulcer.). Coronary artery calcifications. Asbestos-related 
pleural disease. Bilateral pleural effusion with right lower 
lobe consolidation, representing pneumonia versus atelectasis. 
Clinical correlation is recommended. Extensive emphysema. 3.2 cm 
infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with mural thrombus. 
Atherosclerotic disease of thoracoabdominal aorta. Status post 
left nephrectomy. Right renal cyst. Calcified sludge in the 
gallbladder. Somewhat prominent loops of small bowel in the 
lower pelvis measuring up to 2.2 cm filled with fluid. Clinical 
correlation is recommended. Dilated fluid-filled upper 
esophagus, with thickend lower esophagus. Please evaluate for 
the possibility of esophageal disease.
Echo [**4-28**]: Pre stent: Overall left ventricular systolic function 
is normal (LVEF>55%). There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the 
aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending 
thoracic aorta. Approximately 6 cm below the left subclavian, an 
outpouching is seen consistent with a contained rupture of the 
thoracic aorta. The outpouching is at least 2.5 cm in diameter; 
there is no flow in this area. A wire is seen in the lumen of 
the thoracic aorta during the procedure. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. Evidence of a 
Thoracic endostent is seen in the descending thoracic aorta in 
the area previously described as a probable contained rupture. 
The graft appears well seated. There is no evidence for 
endoleak.   
Chest CT [**5-5**]: Patient is status post endoluminal stent graft 
placement for penetrating aortic ulcer without evidence of 
endoleak, and decreased size of surrounding hematoma. Large 
subcutaneous anterior abdominal wall hematoma at site of 
surgical incision and partially involving the left rectus 
abdominis muscle. Post- surgical focal dilatation of left common 
iliac bifurcation consistent with Dacron graft insertion and 
hematoma. Stable 3.2-cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm with 
calcifications and mural thrombus. Stable bilateral pleural 
effusions. Bilateral centrilobular emphysema with scarring at 
the right lung base in this patient status post right 
thoracotomy. Retained mucous retention cyst in the distal 
trachea and right main stem bronchus, with fluid layering in a 
superiorly dilated esophagus. Clinical correlation is 
recommended. Status post left nephrectomy. Right renal artery 
stenosis with evidence of infarction. Multiple right renal cysts 
requiring ultrasound or MRI for further evaluation. 
Asbestos-related pleural disease. Gallstones. Right adrenal 
adenoma.
CXR [**5-6**]: Compared with [**3379-5-4**], the infiltrates in the right mid 
and lower lung fields appear slightly more confluent. There 
appears to be increased volume loss on the right, as evidenced 
by slightly more shift of the heart and mediastinum, although 
this has not changed dramatically. The left lung appears grossly 
clear with interval re-expansion of the left lower lobe 
atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 11144**] was admitted and underwent CTA which demonstrated a 
penetrating ulcer of his descending thoracic aorta at the level 
of inferior pulmonary vein, surrounded by somewhat hyperdense 
soft tissue mass measuring 4.3 x 2.9 cm and 50 [**Doctor Last Name **] on noncontrast 
scan, worrisome for mediastinal hematoma. The CTA was also 
notable for coronary artery calcifications, asbestos-related 
pleural disease, bilateral pleural effusions with right lower 
lobe consolidation, extensive emphysema, and a 3.2 cm infrarenal 
abdominal aortic aneurysm with mural thrombus. Based on these 
results, the patient was referred through Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 93**] for stent 
graft repair. The patient was felt to be a good candidate for 
stent graft repair because the penetrating ulcer was fairly 
localized to the junction between the proximal and middle third 
of the descending thoracic aorta with good landing zones for a 
stent graft proximally and distally. The patient and the 
patient's family understood the risks and benefits of the 
procedure, and wished to proceed. On [**4-28**], Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and 
[**Name5 (PTitle) **] performed an endovascular stent repair of his 
thoracic aortic aneurysm. For surgical details, please see 
seperate dictated operative note. Following the operation, he 
was brought to the CSRU for invasive monitoring. Within 24 
hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. Due to 
some mild respiratory distress and thick secretions with 
hypoxia, therapeutic bronchoscopy was performed on postoperative 
day two. He was aggressively diuresed and required pulmonary 
toilet, frequent intranasal suctioning and nebulizer treatments. 
Due to his tenous respiratory status and fear of aspiration, a 
Dobboff feeding tube was placed for nutritional support. He was 
initially kept NPO and remained on broad spectrum antibiotics. 
Sputum cultures were sent off, eventually growing out 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Antibiotics were titrated accordingly, 
and a course of Meropenum was initiated. Over several days, his 
pulmonary status gradually improved. A bedside swallow 
evaluation on [**5-4**] demonstrated no signs or symptoms of 
aspiration or oropharyngeal dysphagia. He made slow clinical 
improvements and eventually transferred to the SDU on 
postoperative day seven. A PICC line was placed in his right 
upper extremity on [**5-7**] for long term IV antibiotics. A 
course of Meropenum will continue for 2 weeks with the last dose 
on [**5-16**]. He needs follow up of his psuedomonas pneumonia with a 
CXR on [**5-16**] or prior if clinically indicated. Medical therapy 
was optimized as he continued to work with physical therapy to 
regain strength and mobility. He ws ready for discharge on 
[**3379-5-8**].

     INDICATION:  72-year-old male with chest pain, thoracic aortic aneurysm.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial CT images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were
     obtained with administration of IV contrast [**Doctor Last Name 74**], 150 cc of Optiray.  Coronal
     reformation images are reconstructed.
     
     No comparison.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     AORTA:  Note is made of extensive atherosclerotic disease of the
     thoracoabdominal aorta.  There is out pushing of contrast at the descending
     thoracic aorta at the level of inferior pulmonary vein, representing
     penetrating aortic ulcer.  Note is made of soft tissue density surrounding
     penetrating ulcer at the same level, measuring 70 [**Doctor Last Name **] on contrast CT, and most
     likely representing mediastinal hematoma in this patient with penetrating
     ulcer.  No active extravasation of the contrast is noted, however, the finding
     is worrisome for rupture of aorta with underlying  penetrating ulcer with
     mediastinal hematoma. There is fluid in the superior cardiac recess
     surrounding the ascending aorta measuring 15 [**Doctor Last Name **].  In the abdominal aorta,
     again note is made of extensive atherosclerotic disease.  There is 3.2 cm
     calcified infrarenal aneurysm with mural thrombosis, measuring 1.2 cm in
     thickness.  Iliac arteries are also calcified, however, are opacified with
     contrast.
     
     CHEST:  Coronary arteries are calcified.  No significant mediastinal or hilar
     lymphadenopathy.  Note is made of mucous secretion in the right main bronchus.
     Penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer with mediastinal hematoma suspicious for
     rupture as described in the above paragraph.  Note is made of bilateral small
     pleural effusion, with consolidation in right lower lobe, which can represent
     atelectasis, however, can represent pneumonia.  Interlobar effusion is also
     noted.  The patient has calcified pleural plaques bilaterally.  In the lung
     window, note is made of extensive centrilobular emphysema.  Upper esophagus is
     somewhat dilated with air-fluid level. At the level of soft tissue adjacent to
     the aorta, the esophagus is not clearly identified, and at the lower level,
     the wall is somewhat thickened.
     
     ABDOMEN:  The patient is status post left nephrectomy.  Note is made of
                                                                 (Over)

     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Multiple right perihilar clips are demonstrated
     overlying a right hilar mass.  Patchy opacities are demonstrated within the
     right lung base and right mid lung field, which could represent post-
     obstructive atelectasis.  Several pleural plaques are demonstrated within both
     hemithoraces, some which are calcified, consistent with asbestos exposure. The
     heart appears normal in size.  Evaluation of the ascending aorta cannot be
     made due to overlap of the aorta with the right hilar mass.  A small right
     pleural effusion is seen.  Marked volume loss is demonstrated in the right
     lung.  No pneumothoraces.  Multiple clips are demonstrated within the left
     upper quadrant of the abdomen.  No pulmonary edema is noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Right hilar mass with post-obstructive atelectasis and/or pneumonia
     involving the right base.
     
     2.  Asbestos related pleural disease.
     
     3.  Evaluation of the thoracic ascending aorta is limited due to overlying
     right hilar mass.  Comparison with prior studies is recommended or a CT can be
     performed for further evaluation.

     INDICATION:  72-year-old male with chest pain, thoracic aortic aneurysm.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial CT images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were
     obtained with administration of IV contrast [**Doctor Last Name 74**], 150 cc of Optiray.  Coronal
     reformation images are reconstructed.

     FINDINGS:
     
     AORTA:  Note is made of extensive atherosclerotic disease of the
     thoracoabdominal aorta.  There is out pushing of contrast at the descending
     thoracic aorta at the level of inferior pulmonary vein, representing
     penetrating aortic ulcer.  Note is made of soft tissue density surrounding
     penetrating ulcer at the same level, measuring 70 [**Doctor Last Name **] on contrast CT, and most
     likely representing mediastinal hematoma in this patient with penetrating
     ulcer.  No active extravasation of the contrast is noted, however, the finding
     is worrisome for rupture of aorta with underlying  penetrating ulcer with
     mediastinal hematoma. There is fluid in the superior cardiac recess
     surrounding the ascending aorta measuring 15 [**Doctor Last Name **].  In the abdominal aorta,
     again note is made of extensive atherosclerotic disease.  There is 3.2 cm
     calcified infrarenal aneurysm with mural thrombosis, measuring 1.2 cm in
     thickness.  Iliac arteries are also calcified, however, are opacified with
     contrast.
     
     CHEST:  Coronary arteries are calcified.  No significant mediastinal or hilar
     lymphadenopathy.  Note is made of mucous secretion in the right main bronchus.
     Penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer with mediastinal hematoma suspicious for
     rupture as described in the above paragraph.  Note is made of bilateral small
     pleural effusion, with consolidation in right lower lobe, which can represent
     atelectasis, however, can represent pneumonia.  Interlobar effusion is also
     noted.  The patient has calcified pleural plaques bilaterally.  In the lung
     window, note is made of extensive centrilobular emphysema.  Upper esophagus is
     somewhat dilated with air-fluid level. At the level of soft tissue adjacent to

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
       72 year old man with s/p stent graft of descending aortic aneurysm             
       
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      s/p aortic stent graft w/hypoxia-r/o effusion                                   
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Hypoxia in patient after placement of aortic stent
     graft.
     
     Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**3379-4-28**].
     
     The aortic stent graft is in unchanged position in the distal aorta.  The
     patient was extubated in the meantime interval.  The right internal jugular
     line tip is in the mid portion of superior vena cava. Worsening of the right
     lower lobe atelectasis with right mediastinal shift accompanied by worsening
     of right pleural effusion.  The left lung is unchanged, with prominent
     emphysema and interstitial fibrosis.
     
     The bilateral multiple calcified pleural plaques are again noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Worsening of the right lower lobe atelectasis which may be due to large
     amount of airway secretion seen on the patient's torso CT.  Further evaluation
     with bronchoscopy is recommended.
     2.  There is no possibility to exclude mediastinal widening due to bleeding.
     Further evaluation is recommended if clinically suggested.

     INDICATION:  72-year-old man status post endovascular stent.  Evaluate.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3379-4-27**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT non-contrast imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was
     obtained.  Following the administration of 100 cc of intravenous Optiray, MDCT
     imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was repeated.  Delayed images were
     obtained, and coronal and sagittal reformatted images were performed.
     
     CT CHEST WITH ORAL, WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:
     
     AORTA:  There is a persistent small amount of low-density fluid in the
     superior pericardial recess.  The ascending aorta is normal in caliber and
     contour, with a significant amount of atherosclerotic disease.
     
     There has been interval placement of an endoluminal stent graft within the
     descending aorta and traversing the site of prior repair.  The previously
     noted para- aortic/prevertebral fluid collection consistent with hematoma is
     stable or slightly smaller in size, measuring 35 x 24 mm ([**3-/3327**]) previously 43
     x 30 mm. Distally, and within the abdomen, there is a significant amount of
     atherosclerosis.  The celiac artery and SMA artery origins are widely patent.
     There is narrowing/stenosis of the right renal artery origin.  The patient is
     status post left nephrectomy.  The inferior mesenteric artery origin is not
     visualized.  Again noted is an infrarenal calcified aneurysm with mural
     thrombus measuring up to 3.2 cm in maximum diameter.  Dense calcifications are
     noted in bilateral iliac arteries.  At the left common iliac bifurcation, and
     in the site of prior stenosis, widening is consistent with Dacron tube graft
     placement. This likely corresponds with a post-angioplasty pseudoaneurysm.
     There is no active contrast extravasation.  The remaining vessels are
     unchanged.
     
     CHEST:  There are dense coronary artery calcifications.  Prominent mediastinal
     lymph nodes do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.  There is no
     hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy.  Mucous retention cysts are seen within
     the area of the right main stem bronchus.  Fluid is seen layering within a
     proximally dilated esophagus, with stenosis more distally.  The patient is
     status post right lung thoracotomy and lobar resection.  There is diffuse
     centrilobular emphysema with traction bronchiectasis and atelectasis at the
                                                                 (Over)

     right lung base.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are stable in size.  Again
     noted are diffuse pleural calcifications consistent with asbestos-related lung
     disease.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT ORAL, WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The liver
     enhances normally without focal nodules or masses.  Dense sludge, and gas-
     filled stones are again noted within a normal appearing gallbladder.  The
     pancreas is fatty replaced.  The spleen is normal.  The patient is status post
     left nephrectomy.  Multiple low-density lesions within the right kidney likely
     represent simple cysts, but are incompletely characterized.  The cortical
     irregularity, and wedge-shaped defects within the right kidney are concerning
     for infarction.  The abdominal loops of large and small bowel are normal in
     caliber and contour.  There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal
     lymphadenopathy.  There is no free air and no free fluid.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH ORAL, WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is a large subcutaneous
     hematoma anterior to, and partially involving the left rectus abdominis
     muscle, and measuring 8.8 x 3.5 cm in maximum diameter.  There is hematoma
     surrounding the left common iliac artery, mainly at the level of the
     bifurcation at the Dacron graft insertion.  A small amount of bloody fluid is
     seen within the pelvis.  A Foley catheter is seen within a collapsed bladder.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  The bones are demineralized.  There are no suspicious lytic or
     sclerotic osseous abnormalities.  Healed right anterior and lateral rib
     fractures are again seen consistent with prior thoracotomy.
     
     Coronal and sagittal reformatted images confirmed the axial findings.  MPR
     value grade 2.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Patient is status post endoluminal stent graft placement for
     penetrating aortic ulcer without evidence of endoleak, and decreased size of
     surrounding hematoma.
     2.  Large subcutaneous anterior abdominal wall hematoma at site of surgical
     incision and partially involving the left rectus abdominis muscle.  Post-
     surgical focal dilatation of left common iliac bifurcation consistent with
     Dacron graft insertion and hematoma.
     3.  Stable 3.2-cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm with calcifications and mural
     thrombus.
     4.  Stable bilateral pleural effusions.
     5.  Bilateral centrilobular emphysema with scarring at the right lung base in

     6.  Retained mucous retention cyst in the distal trachea and right main stem
     bronchus, with fluid layering in a superiorly dilated esophagus.  Clinical

     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT non-contrast imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was
     obtained.  Following the administration of 100 cc of intravenous Optiray, MDCT
     imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was repeated.  Delayed images were
     obtained, and coronal and sagittal reformatted images were performed.
     
     CT CHEST WITH ORAL, WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:
     
     AORTA:  There is a persistent small amount of low-density fluid in the
     superior pericardial recess.  The ascending aorta is normal in caliber and
     contour, with a significant amount of atherosclerotic disease.
     
     There has been interval placement of an endoluminal stent graft within the
     descending aorta and traversing the site of prior repair.  The previously
     noted para- aortic/prevertebral fluid collection consistent with hematoma is
     stable or slightly smaller in size, measuring 35 x 24 mm ([**3-/3327**]) previously 43
     x 30 mm. Distally, and within the abdomen, there is a significant amount of
     atherosclerosis.  The celiac artery and SMA artery origins are widely patent.
     There is narrowing/stenosis of the right renal artery origin.  The patient is
     status post left nephrectomy.  The inferior mesenteric artery origin is not
     visualized.  Again noted is an infrarenal calcified aneurysm with mural
     thrombus measuring up to 3.2 cm in maximum diameter.  Dense calcifications are
     noted in bilateral iliac arteries.  At the left common iliac bifurcation, and

     FINDINGS:  Compared with [**3379-5-4**], the infiltrates in the right mid and lower
     lung fields appear slightly more confluent.  There appears to be increased
     volume loss on the right, as evidenced by slightly more shift of the heart and
     mediastinum, although this has not changed dramatically.
     
     The left lung appears grossly clear with interval re-expansion of the left
     lower lobe atelectasis.

     COMPARISON:  [**3379-5-13**].
     
     INDICATION:  PICC line placement.
     
     Right PICC line terminates in the superior vena cava.  Cardiac and mediastinal
     contours are stable with aortic stent graft in place.  There is postoperative
     volume loss in the right hemithorax.  There are extensive bilateral areas of
     pleural plaque formation.  There are interstitial opacities at the lung bases,
     without interval change.  Again demonstrated is a more confluent poorly
     defined area of opacity in the right lower lobe partially obscuring the right
     hemidiaphragm.  Larger area of opacity was present in this region on older
     radiographs of [**3379-4-5**].  Only possibly due to an area of resolving
     atelectasis or pneumonia, underlying neoplasm at this site cannot be excluded.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Right PICC line terminates in the superior vena cava.
     
     2.  Poorly defined right basilar opacity, possibly due to a resolving area of
     atelectasis or infection, but underlying neoplastic process is not excluded. 
     If this finding persists on followup radiographs, CT would be recommended to
     further characterize this area.

     INDICATION:  Evaluate for signs of abscess or infection.
     
     Right PICC line is unchanged in position.  There remains shift of the
     mediastinum to the right in keeping with postoperative volume loss.  Aortic
     stent graft is unchanged in position.  There is extensive consolidation in the
     right lower lobe, best visualized on the lateral view.  This appears to have
     been present on multiple prior studies but has progressed compared to prior
     lateral chest x-ray of [**3379-5-13**].  Bilateral calcified pleural plaque and
     bilateral areas of pleural thickening are again demonstrated.  There is also a
     small left pleural effusion present.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe consolidation concerning for pneumonia.

     interstitial opacities.  Small loculated right pleural effusion is unchanged.
     There is a new small left pleural effusion.  Bilateral calcified pleural
     plaques are again noted, consistent with previous asbestos exposure.  A stent
     remains present in the descending aorta. PICC position was communicated to

                                     FINAL REPORT
     STUDY:  CT-guided drainage.
     
     INDICATION:  Patient with history of periesophageal abscess.  For drainage.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Informed consent was obtained from the patient.  A preprocedure
     timeout was performed to confirm patient identity and indication for
     examination.  Under CT fluoroscopic guidance, an 8 French [**Last Name (un) 3408**] catheter was
     advanced in a paravertebral position to the region of the azygoesophageal
     recess, where an air-filled cavity was identified.  A few mL of fluid were
     aspirated and the catheter was discharged and coiled in suitable position. The
     patient tolerated the procedure well and a post-procedural examination
     confirmed excellent positioning of the catheter.  There were no immediate
     complications.  Procedure was performed by the attending radiologist, Dr.
     [**First Name (STitle) 4333**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There is evidence of extensive lung disease.  Calcified pleural
     plaques are identified and volume loss secondary to thoracotomy is identified
     in the right side where  there is some paracicatricial bullous formation.
     Multiple post-surgical clips are also identified.  In the lung bases, there is
     evidence of some interstitial thickening particularly on the right side, but
     this is poorly characterized on this single-phase examination and correlation
     with dedicated chest imaging if deemed clinically appropriate is recommended.
     A large focus of airspace consolidation in the right lower lobe measuring
     approximately 3.5 x 4 cm likely reflects an infectious etiology but again
     correlation with clinical history and prior imaging may be appropriate.  The
     visualized  bones appear essentially normal, although post-thoracotomy changes
     are identified on the right side.  A stent is identified within the descending
     aorta, but the presence of endoleak or other complication cannot be ruled out
     on this non-contrast examination.
     
     Some apparent secretions are identified within the distal trachea and both
     airways and some definite narrowing of the right main bronchus is identified.
     Again correlation with history and previous imaging as well as dedicated chest
     radiology is recommended.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     1.  Successful placement of drainage.
     2.  Extensive background lung disease including probable prior asbestos
     exposure, probable interstitial disease, airspace disease within the right
     lower lobe, possibly infectious, secretions within the major airways with
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     STUDY:  CT-guided drainage.
     
     INDICATION:  Patient with history of periesophageal abscess.  For drainage.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Informed consent was obtained from the patient.  A preprocedure
     timeout was performed to confirm patient identity and indication for
     examination.  Under CT fluoroscopic guidance, an 8 French [**Last Name (un) 3408**] catheter was
     advanced in a paravertebral position to the region of the azygoesophageal
     recess, where an air-filled cavity was identified.  A few mL of fluid were
     aspirated and the catheter was discharged and coiled in suitable position. The
     patient tolerated the procedure well and a post-procedural examination
     confirmed excellent positioning of the catheter.  There were no immediate
     complications.  Procedure was performed by the attending radiologist, Dr.
     [**First Name (STitle) 4333**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There is evidence of extensive lung disease.  Calcified pleural
     plaques are identified and volume loss secondary to thoracotomy is identified
     in the right side where  there is some paracicatricial bullous formation.
     Multiple post-surgical clips are also identified.  In the lung bases, there is
     evidence of some interstitial thickening particularly on the right side, but
     this is poorly characterized on this single-phase examination and correlation
     with dedicated chest imaging if deemed clinically appropriate is recommended.
     A large focus of airspace consolidation in the right lower lobe measuring
     approximately 3.5 x 4 cm likely reflects an infectious etiology but again
     correlation with clinical history and prior imaging may be appropriate.  The
     visualized  bones appear essentially normal, although post-thoracotomy changes
     are identified on the right side.  A stent is identified within the descending
     aorta, but the presence of endoleak or other complication cannot be ruled out
     on this non-contrast examination.
     
     Some apparent secretions are identified within the distal trachea and both
     airways and some definite narrowing of the right main bronchus is identified.
     Again correlation with history and previous imaging as well as dedicated chest
     radiology is recommended.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     1.  Successful placement of drainage.
     2.  Extensive background lung disease including probable prior asbestos
     exposure, probable interstitial disease, airspace disease within the right
     lower lobe, possibly infectious, secretions within the major airways with
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION:  Status post endovascular stent with esophageal rupture and
     abscess drainage.  Evaluate for abscess/fluid collection.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired images of the chest with intravenous contrast.  
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3379-5-5**].
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH ORAL AND INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Baricat was given to the
     patient immediately prior to the CT acquisitions to best assess for possible
     esophageal leak.  Barium is seen within the esophageal lumen, and there is no
     evidence of barium extravasation.  Surrounding the distal aspect of the
     esophagus, posterior to the opacified lumen, there is a collection measuring
     1.9 x 1.4 cm and extending approximately over 4 cm in craniocaudal dimension.
     This is therefore significantly smaller than on the prior study of [**5-5**],
     befor drainage.  No rim enhancement or gas collections is seen to suggest the
     presence of a abscess.  An infectious fluid collection, however, cannot be
     excluded. There is stability of the vascular structures in the chest.  Again
     noted are dense coronary artery calcifications.  Prominent mediastinal lymph
     nodes are again noted, which do not meet size criteria for pathologic
     enlargement. There also is hilar and axillary lymphadenopathy.  These appear
     stable.  The patient is status post right lung thoracotomy and lobar
     resection.  There is diffuse centrilobular emphysema with architectural
     distortion and traction bronchiectasis.  At the right lung base, there is a
     stable consolidation.  There are diffuse pleural calcifications consistent
     with asbestos-related lung disease.
     
     No significant interval change is seen in the visualized portions of the upper
     abdomen.  A note of calcium-containing gallbladder, multiple exophytic right
     renal cysts, absent left kidney and fatty replaced pancreas.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No significant interval change is seen.  There is
     demineralization.  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are seen.  Healed
     rib fractures are seen in this patient status post thoracotomy.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  No evidence of esophageal perforation.
     
     2.  Collection around the posterior distal esophagus is smaller than on the
     prior scan, and does not show rim enhancement to suggest the presence of a
     walled-off abscess.  However, infectious collection cannot be excluded.
                                                                 (Over)

     POTABLE AP RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:
     
     In comparison to the prior plain radiograph, there is an increased oacity in
     the right lower lung which is consistent with a consolidation seen on todays
     CT. On CT, however, no progression in the interval to the prior CT is seen.
     There has been removal of a drainage catheter draining a paraesophageal
     collection.  A left-sided PICC line is in unchanged position. Again seen is an
     aortic stent graft, multiple mediastinal and right upper lobe as well as upper

     INDICATION:  72-year-old man with history of esophageal perforation status
     post repair with endoclip.  Referred to video oropharyngeal swallow to rule
     out aspiration. 
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Video oropharyngeal swallow in conjunction with speech therapy.  
     
     Prior to video oropharyngeal swallow evaluation patient underwent esophagram
     to rule out perforation using Optiray contrast which demonstrated no evidence
     of contrast extravasation though it was a limited study due to aspiration of
     Optiray.  
     
     FINDINGS:  Patient underwent video oropharyngeal swallow by speech therapy
     with assistance of radiology.  Patient was administered barium contrast in
     multiple consistencies in an upright seated posture.  Patient had mildly
     impaired oral phase with poor bolus formation and control.  There was
     premature spillover to the valleculae with all consistencies of barium given.
     There was also mild amounts of oral residue after all consistencies of barium
     which then spilled into the valleculae after swallow.
     
     As for the pharyngeal phase, the patient had mild delay in swallow initiation.
     Patient had incomplete laryngeal valve closure with reduced epiglottic
     deflection.  There was a mild amount of residue in valleculae and piriform
     sinuses after all consistencies of barium given.  During the study the patient
     was noted to have penetration of all consistencies of barium and aspirated
     trace to mild amounts after all consistencies due to spillover of pharyngeal
     residue mixing with patient's own secretions.  Patient demonstrated silent
     aspiration.  Given history of esophageal perforation, the esophagus was
     screened during procedure which demonstrated no gross leaking of contrast.  
     
     IMPRESSIONS:
     
     1.  Patient with impaired swallow functioning.  The patient exhibits
     aspiration of all consistencies of barium.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      assess interval change

     INDICATION:  Dyspnea, drainage of a paraaortic abscess.
     
     COMPARISON:  Chest CT from [**3379-6-24**] and chest radiograph from [**3379-6-24**].
     
     UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Numerous surgical clips are demonstrated within
     the right mediastinum and left upper quadrant of the abdomen.  Bilateral
     calcified pleural plaques and thickening are unchanged.  There is unchanged
     evidence of volume loss in the right lung with shift of the mediastinum
     towards the right and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Increasing
     opacity in the right lung base may be secondary to worsening pneumonia or
     aspiration.  Minimal atelectasis is present within the left lung base.  No
     definite effusions or pneumothorax are present.  Pulmonary vascularity is
     within normal limits.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Worsening right basilar opacity which could reflect aspiration or
     pneumonia.  Bilateral calcified pleural plaques.
                                                                           DFDdp

     INDICATION:  72-year-old man with history of esophageal perforation, status
     post repair with Endoclip, referred for upper GI to assess esophageal leak.
     
     COMPARISON:  Esophagram [**3379-6-4**].
     
     FINDINGS:  Patient was placed in a seated position and was given Optiray
     contrast to drink under fluoroscopy.  On first attempt, the patient exhibited
     gross aspiration of contrast material.  The contrast passed the esophagus and
     freely entered the stomach without any evidence of gross extravasation.  Due
     to patient's gross aspiration, the study was terminated.  Given this limited
     exam, it is difficult to rule out perforation, though there is no
     extravasation of contrast seen on initial exam.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Aspiration.
     2.  No gross extravasation of contrast from esophagus, though cannot rule out
     perforation given limited exam.

     CLINICAL HISTORY:  Recent esophageal rupture.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
     
     CHEST:  The film is considerably rotated.  Multiple clips are present in the
     right side suggesting prior lobectomy.  Compared with the prior chest x-ray of
     July the 21st, there has been some clearing of the right lower lobe though
     atelectasis and infiltrates persist.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle
     is again seen.  Extensive pleural calcifications on the left side is seen.
     
     The tip of the left IJ line lies rather lateral in the right chest.  This is
     probably due to distortion rotation rather than abnormal positioning.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Some clearing of right lower lobe infiltrate.

     known paraortic abscess.
     
     Portable AP chest radiograph compared to previous film from [**3379-6-27**].
     
     There is increased opacity in the right lung with more prominent right
     mediastinal shift, suggesting worsening of the right middle and lower lobe
     atelectasis. The left lung and the right upper lung appearances are unchanged.
     The aortic stent is again demonstrated.  There is contrast material with air-
     fluid level within the esophagus, most probably due to lower obstruction of
     the esophagus by the known paraortic abscess.  There is no sizable left
     pleural effusion and there is a mild right pleural effusion.  There is no
     pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Worsening of the right middle and lower lobe atelectasis; slight increase
     in  adjacent pleural effusion.
     2.  Contrast material within the esophagus; correlation with timing of
     administration of contrast recommended.  Lower esophageal obstruction by known
     paraaortic abscess cannot be excluded.

     HISTORY:  72-year-old male with history of esophageal perforation.
     
     VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW EXAMINATION:  An oral and pharyngeal swallowing
     videofluoroscopy was performed today in collaboration with the speech and
     language pathology division.  Various consistencies of barium including thin
     liquid, nectar thickened liquid, puree, and [**12-7**] cookie coated with thin barium
     were administered.
     
     The oral phase was notable for prolonged mastication and moderate impairment
     of bolus formation, control and AP tongue movement.  Oral transit time was
     prolonged and there was mild oral cavity residue with thin liquids.  The
     pharyngeal phase was notable for moderate delay in swallow initiation.  There
     was normal velar elevation and epiglottic deflection.  Laryngeal elevation was
     normal to slightly reduced.  There was mild vallecular residue with thin
     liquids.  There was slight prominence of the cricopharyngeus but no evidence
     of early closure or back flow.  There was penetration during the swallow with
     both cup sips of thin and nectar-thickened liquids.  A spontaneous cough was
     ineffective at clearing the penetrated material.  There was trace aspiration
     before the swallow with a cup sip of thin liquids despite a chin tuck
     maneuver.  The patient was insensate to this trace aspirate without
     spontaneous cough.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Moderate oral phase impairment.  Mild oral cavity and vallecular
     residue with thin liquids.  Penetration during the swallow with nectar and
     thin liquids and trace aspiration before the swallow with thin liquids despite
     chin tuck maneuver.
     
     For greater detail and for treatment recommendations please see the dedicated
     speech and language pathology division report of the same date.

     PA AND LATERAL CHEST, [**7-2**].
     
     HISTORY:  Drainage of periaortic abscess.  Dyspnea.
     
     IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to [**6-28**] through 27:
     
     There has been no appreciable change in the appearance of the chest since [**6-28**].  Bulging of mediastinal contour in the right chest projecting over the
     right hilus and the extensive right pleural abnormality are unchanged since
     [**6-28**].  There is no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.  Base of the right
     lung is severely atelectatic and rightward mediastinal shift is unchanged.
     Mediastinal contours on the left of the heart and grafted descending thoracic
     aorta are stable as is a small left pleural effusion layering posteriorly.
     Left upper lung is clear.  Extensive asbestos related pleural calcification
     noted.
     
     Tip of the right PIC catheter projects over the upper SVC.
     
     More useful characterization of right pleural and mediastinal abnormalities
     would require CT scanning, when clinically justified.

     HISTORY:  Esophageal rupture, question new pneumonia, question endotracheal
     tube placement.
     
     REFERENCE EXAM:  [**7-2**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There is a new endotracheal tube.  The aortic stent graft is again
     visualized.  There is dense opacification of the right hemithorax with
     mediastinal shift to the right.  It is difficult to tell where the right
     subclavian line tip is given the extent of the mediastinal shift.  Right-sided
     clips are again seen.  Extensive pleural disease on the left is again seen. 
     The new finding of the mediastinal shift with near complete opacification of
     the right hemithorax was called to the treating physician at the time of
     dictating this report on [**7-4**] at 08:30.

     FINDINGS:
     
     This is a portable examination as the patient is intubated.
     
     The right kidney measures 12.5 cm in maximum length.  In relation to the upper
     pole, note is made of an area of low echogenicity measuring less than 2 cm. 
     This demonstrates posterior acoustic enhancement.  The appearance is most
     likely consistent with a simple cyst.  The resistive index was calculated in
     relation to the renal artery of the lower, mid and upper poles and measured
     0.76, 0.74, and 0.68 respectively.  There is good perfusion of the right

      ? kidney perfusion

                                     FINAL REPORT
     EXAMINATION:  Solitary right kidney.  Query acute tubular necrosis from
     hypertension, bradycardia.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     This is a portable examination as the patient is intubated.
     
     The right kidney measures 12.5 cm in maximum length.  In relation to the upper
     pole, note is made of an area of low echogenicity measuring less than 2 cm. 
     This demonstrates posterior acoustic enhancement.  The appearance is most
     likely consistent with a simple cyst.  The resistive index was calculated in
     relation to the renal artery of the lower, mid and upper poles and measured
     0.76, 0.74, and 0.68 respectively.  There is good perfusion of the right
     kidney.  Good flow is identified in relation to the renal vein.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     
     Solitary right kidney which measures 12.5 cm in length with simple cyst in
     upper pole.
     
     Good perfusion identified.  No evidence of any obstruction.  No evidence of
     any extrarenal collection.

     INDICATION:  72-year-old man, status post endovascular stent and esophageal
     rupture, now with new fevers.  Evaluate for sinusitis.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images of the sinuses were obtained with coronal
     reformatted images.
     
     CT SINUS:  There is minimal mucosal thickening within the left maxillary
     sinus, and within several ethmoid air cells.  The frontal sinus and the
     maxillary sinuses are well aerated.  The sphenoid sinus is underdeveloped. G-
     tube positioned and travelling through the left nostril, and extending into
     the esophagus.  Additionally, there is an ET tube within the mouth.  There
     appears to be some edema of the tongue.  The soft tissues are otherwise normal
     in appearance.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Minor paranasal sinus mucosal thickening.
     
     NOTE: There may be soft tissue opacification of the left petrous apex air cell
     complex, as opposed to normal medullary bone. In any case, the appearance is
     unchnaged, compared with the prior head CT scan of [**3379-6-24**].

      Stable appearance of the chest compared to the prior exam.  Residual
      fluid/soft tissue around the distal esopahgus is slightly smaller than before.
       Left pleural effusion and lung parenchymal changes stable.  Small amount of
      perihepatic fluid likely there before.  No large intra-abdominal fluid
      collections.

     INDICATIONS:  Prior endovascular stent placement in aorta and esophageal
     rupture, now with fevers.  Assess for pneumonia or fluid collection.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Volumetric CT imaging of the torso was performed with oral
     contrast only.
     
     COMPARISON:  Chest CT scan from [**3379-6-24**].
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST:  Post-surgical changes in the right
     hemithorax including volume reduction and prior thoracotomy are unchanged.
     Interstitial opacities in both lung bases and extensive bilateral pleural
     calcified pleural plaques are unchanged.  No new focal areas of consolidation
     or ground-glass opacity are present.  No new fluid collection is present
     adjacent to the aorta or in the region of the esophagus.  There is no
     pericardial effusion.  There is a small loculated left pleural effusion which
     is not significantly changed in appearance since the prior study.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Assessment of the solid abdominal
     organs is severely limited without IV contrast.  Allowing for this, no gross
     hepatic or splenic lesions are identified. A tiny amount of ascites is seen
     around the liver.  Multiple surgical clips are present around the spleen and
     in the left renal fossa from prior nephrectomy.  Two low density rounded areas
     are seen adjacent to the right kidney which are most likely cysts.  The right
     adrenal gland is unremarkable.  A small amount of increased density is seen in
     the gallbladder which could reflect stones.  The pancreas is atrophic but
     otherwise unremarkable.
     
     There is diffuse opacification of small and large bowel with oral contrast.
     There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.  Note is made of irregular
     thickening of the splenic flexure with a featureless bowel lumen.  This

     extends into the descending colon, which is largely collapsed and therefore
     unable to be evaluated.  More distended portions in the rectosigmoid also
     appears to have a slightly thickened wall.  There is no ascites or pericolic
     stranding.  The descending aorta is heavily calcified including the ostia of
     the SMA and celiac axis.  There is mild infrarenal aneurysmal dilatation of
     the aorta with maximal axial dimensions of 3.1 x 3.3 cm.  However, this is not
     significantly changed since the torso CT scan from [**4-27**].
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is no pelvic fluid collection.
     There is a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.  The bladder contains a
     Foley catheter and air.  No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are
     identified.
     
     Mild demineralization and diffuse degenerative changes are seen within the
     spine.  No lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.  Post-surgical changes
     are seen in the right ribs.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  No evidence of intra-abdominal or intrathoracic abscess.  No worsening
     collections around esophagus or aortic stent graft.
     
     2)  New asymmetric wall thickening and loss of normal mucosal features in the
     splenic flexure and probably extending into the descending and rectosigmoid
     colon. Findings raise concern for colitis.  Given patient is on antibiotics,
     C. difficile colitis is possible.  Ischemia is also of concern given extensive
     vascular calcifications elsewhere.
     
     3)  No significant change in appearance of lung opacities and loculated left
     pleural effusion.
     
     4)  Unchanged abdominal aortic aneurysm.  The internal details cannot be
     assessed on the study.

     adjacent to the aorta or in the region of the esophagus.  There is no
     pericardial effusion.  There is a small loculated left pleural effusion which
     is not significantly changed in appearance since the prior study.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Assessment of the solid abdominal
     organs is severely limited without IV contrast.  Allowing for this, no gross
     hepatic or splenic lesions are identified. A tiny amount of ascites is seen
     around the liver.  Multiple surgical clips are present around the spleen and
     in the left renal fossa from prior nephrectomy.  Two low density rounded areas
     are seen adjacent to the right kidney which are most likely cysts.  The right
     adrenal gland is unremarkable.  A small amount of increased density is seen in
     the gallbladder which could reflect stones.  The pancreas is atrophic but
     otherwise unremarkable.
     
     There is diffuse opacification of small and large bowel with oral contrast.
     There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.  Note is made of irregular
     thickening of the splenic flexure with a featureless bowel lumen.  This
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     extends into the descending colon, which is largely collapsed and therefore
     unable to be evaluated.  More distended portions in the rectosigmoid also
     appears to have a slightly thickened wall.  There is no ascites or pericolic
     stranding.  The descending aorta is heavily calcified including the ostia of
     the SMA and celiac axis.  There is mild infrarenal aneurysmal dilatation of
     the aorta with maximal axial dimensions of 3.1 x 3.3 cm.  However, this is not
     significantly changed since the torso CT scan from [**4-27**].
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is no pelvic fluid collection.
     There is a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.  The bladder contains a
     Foley catheter and air.  No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are
     identified.
     
     Mild demineralization and diffuse degenerative changes are seen within the
     spine.  No lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.  Post-surgical changes
     are seen in the right ribs.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  No evidence of intra-abdominal or intrathoracic abscess.  No worsening
     collections around esophagus or aortic stent graft.
     
     2)  New asymmetric wall thickening and loss of normal mucosal features in the
     splenic flexure and probably extending into the descending and rectosigmoid
     colon. Findings raise concern for colitis.  Given patient is on antibiotics,
     C. difficile colitis is possible.  Ischemia is also of concern given extensive
     vascular calcifications elsewhere.
     
     3)  No significant change in appearance of lung opacities and loculated left
     pleural effusion.
     
     4)  Unchanged abdominal aortic aneurysm.  The internal details cannot be
     assessed on the study.
     
     Initial findings describing no large intra-abdominal or thoracic collection
     identified was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4754**] at 3:00 a.m. on [**7-7**]. Findings
     detailing the colon were related to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4754**] at 10:45 a.m. on [**3379-7-7**].

     INDICATION:  Esophageal leak complicated by pneumonia.  Needs IV antibiotics
     and access.
     
     PROCEDURE:  This procedure was performed by doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 525**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 42**], with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 42**], the attending radiologist, present and supervising throughout. Scout
     image was taken demonstrating a subclavian central venous line in the
     confluence of the SVC and the left brachiocephalic vein.  Also seen is an
     aortic stent.  The patient's left arm was prepped and draped in the usual
     sterile fashion.  As no suitable veins were seen, ultrasound was used to
     identify the left brachial vein, which was patent and compressible.  After
     administration of 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia, the vein was accessed
     with a 21-gauge needle, then a nitinol wire threaded through the vein.
     Hard copy ultrasound images were obtained before and after venous access
     documenting vessel patency. Then the needle was exchanged for a 4- French
     micropuncture sheath, and the wire advanced under fluoroscopy into the SVC,
     where, based on the markers on the guidewire, the PICC was trimmed to 53 cm.
     The line was threaded over the wire into the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.
     The wire and peel-away sheath were removed, the line capped, flushed, and
     heplocked.  A sterile dressing was applied.
     
     Next, the left central venous line was freed of its sutures, and the line
     pulled under fluoroscopy.  A final fluoroscopic image was taken demonstrating
     the tip of the PICC in the RA/SVC junction.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful removal of central venous line and replacement with
     left double lumen 53 cm PICC via the left brachial vein with tip in distal
     SVC.  The line is ready for use.

     INDICATION:  Esophageal leak complicated by pneumonia.  Needs IV antibiotics
     and access.
     
     PROCEDURE:  This procedure was performed by doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 525**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 42**], with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 42**], the attending radiologist, present and supervising throughout. Scout
     image was taken demonstrating a subclavian central venous line in the
     confluence of the SVC and the left brachiocephalic vein.  Also seen is an
     aortic stent.  The patient's left arm was prepped and draped in the usual
     sterile fashion.  As no suitable veins were seen, ultrasound was used to
     identify the left brachial vein, which was patent and compressible.  After
     administration of 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia, the vein was accessed
     with a 21-gauge needle, then a nitinol wire threaded through the vein.
     Hard copy ultrasound images were obtained before and after venous access
     documenting vessel patency. Then the needle was exchanged for a 4- French
     micropuncture sheath, and the wire advanced under fluoroscopy into the SVC,
     where, based on the markers on the guidewire, the PICC was trimmed to 53 cm.
     The line was threaded over the wire into the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.
     The wire and peel-away sheath were removed, the line capped, flushed, and
     heplocked.  A sterile dressing was applied.
     
     Next, the left central venous line was freed of its sutures, and the line
     pulled under fluoroscopy.  A final fluoroscopic image was taken demonstrating
     the tip of the PICC in the RA/SVC junction.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful removal of central venous line and replacement with
     left double lumen 53 cm PICC via the left brachial vein with tip in distal
     SVC.  The line is ready for use.

     AP CHEST, 8:41 A.M. [**7-19**].
     
     HISTORY:  Esophageal rupture, bronchomalacia and right lung atelectasis.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**7-10**] through 13:
     
     Right lung previously entirely collapsed on [**7-17**] showed some improvement
     in aeration on [**7-18**], but more atelectasis and at least a small right
     pleural effusion today.  Mild interstitial edema in the left lung which
     worsened from [**7-17**] through 13 has stabilized.  Small left pleural
     effusion has decreased.  Cardiac silhouette size is difficult to assess, but
     may be enlarged relative to [**7-10**].  Stents are seen in the descending
     thoracic aorta and right main bronchus.  Feeding tube passes through the mid
     stomach and out of view.
