Admission Date:  [**3079-11-24**]     Discharge Date:  [**3079-11-24**]

Date of Birth:   [**3003-4-15**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CT [**Doctor First Name **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75-year-old white
female with a past medical history significant for coronary
artery disease status post acute inferior wall myocardial
infarction and subsequent post infarct ventricular septal
defect, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, obesity,
hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia who presented to the
Cardiac Catheterization Lab [**3079-11-24**] for an acute inferior
ST elevation MI.

Cardiac catheterization revealed two-vessel coronary artery
disease with moderate systolic ventricular dysfunction as
well as a moderate left-to-right intracardiac shunt at the
ventricular level and an acute inferior myocardial infarction
managed by acute percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty of the right coronary artery vessel.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was emergently brought to the
Operating Room that same day, [**3079-11-24**], for an emergent
ventricular septal defect closure and coronary artery bypass
grafting times one with a saphenous vein graft to the left
anterior descending artery.

In the Operating Room the patient became progressively more
hemodynamically unstable with profound tachycardia and a
falling blood pressure.  She was intubated and emergently
prepped and draped.  She was found to have a very large
ventricular septal defect.  A patch was sewn over the VSD and
the VSD was debrided of the necrotic tissue as much as
possible.  When complete, a second patch was placed over the
right ventricle, after which BioGlue was applied to the whole
area to assure hemostasis, at which point the saphenous vein
graft was placed to the left anterior descending artery.
Upon removal of the cross clamp the patient's heart was
allowed to resuscitate for 40 minutes, and the patient was
subsequently weaned off bypass, and Protamine was begun on
the patient.

Upon removal of the cannula from the patient's heart, the
suture line tore are the inferior aspect of the patch
closure, and the patient's chest filled with blood.  She was
crashed back on bypass with an attempt to repair the suture
line with more BioGlue and sutures, however, with
unsatisfactory results.  She weaned off of her bypass with
the inability to achieve hemostasis at that time, and the
patient expired at 8:45 p.m. [**3079-11-24**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Post infarct ventricular septal defect.
2.  Coronary artery disease.

Because of the emergent nature of this patient's condition,
an adequate medical history was not obtained with no outside
medical records available for consultation.
