     INDICATION:  77 year old post op day number 10 from TAH/BSO.  Now with
     abdominal pain.  Assess for abscess.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast. 150 cc of Optiray
     were used for this examination due to patient history of debility.
     
     No prior studies.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:
     
     Atelectatic changes are seen in both lung bases.  Numerous small gallstones
     are seen within the gallbladder.  There is no gallbladder wall thickening or
     pericholecystic fluid.  The common bile duct is somewhat prominent measuring
     up to 9 mm in the ampullary region.  No intraluminal filling defects are seen.
     There is mild intrahepatic ductal dilation as well.
     
     The liver is otherwise unremarkable in appearance.  A tiny hypodensity is seen
     within the posterior aspect of the spleen which is too small to characterize.
     The spleen is otherwise normal.  Stranding of the mesenteric fat is seen
     around the head and mid portion of the pancreas consistent with pancreatitis.
     No periampullary mass is identified.  The adrenals are normal in appearance.
     Numerous cysts are seen scattered throughout both kidneys, and cortical
     thinning is also seen in both kidneys.  The kidneys enhance and excrete
     contrast symmetrically.  No free air, free fluid, or pathologic
     lymphadenopathy is seen in the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS W/IV CONTRAST:
     
     The rectum, distal ureters, and bladder are unremarkable.  The sigmoid is
     collapsed.  No free fluid or lymphadenopathy is seen in the pelvis.  There is
     no focal fluid collection or abscess identified.  The patient is post
     hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy.
     
     The osseous structures demonstrate mild degenerative changes in the lower
                                                                 (Over)

     the lower anterior abdominal wall, likely post surgical in nature.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Stranding surrounding the pancreas consistent with pancreatitis.  Numerous
     gallstones are seen within the gallbladder, and the common bile duct is
     somewhat prominent. This suggests the possibility of a passed stone with
     resultant pancreatitis.
     
     2)  No evidence of intra-abdominal or pelvic abscess.
     
     3)  Post surgical changes in the soft tissues of the anterior abdominal wall.
     4)  Bibasilar atelectasis.

IMPRESSION: 1) Interval development of stranding about the cecum 
and proximal ascending colon with suggestion of bowel wall 
edema. No free air to suggest perforation. Although there is a 
suggestion of bowel wall edema. No diverticula are visualized, 
however the differential diagnosis of this finding includes 
diverticulitis, infectious or inflammatory colitis,including C. 
difficile colitis, or less likely or ischemia. Appendix is not 
visualized. The mesenteric vessels are well visualized and are 
patent proximally.
2) Stranding about the pancreatic head and probable small fluid 
collection about the pancreatic head and duodenum consistent 
with the patient's diagnosis of pancreatitis.
3) Gallstones and pneumobilia. Slight decrease in intrahepatic 
biliary ductal dilatation. Pneumobilia may relate to the given 
history of ERCP.
4) Bilateral renal cysts and additional hypodense lesions within 
the kidneys, too small to accurately characterize, but likely 
representing cysts.
5) Open surgical wound within the anterior abdominal wall.

pain. Pt was found to be hypotensive (SBP <80) in the ED, a CVL 
was placed and pt transferred to the ICU for acute care. Empiric 
antibiotics started Vanc/Flagyl/Ceftriaxone. Pts SBP normalized 
in the ICU (120-130s) and pt rehydrated with fluid boluses on 
HD2. Diarrhea ceased and pt began constipated. Overnight on HD3, 
pt required continued fluid boluses secondary to low UOP. Pt 
started on clear liquid HD3 Pt improved with increased UOP and 
stabilized SBP. Pt transferred to the floor on HD4 on PO Flagyl 
and on regular diet. A UA/UCx was performed that showed a UTI 
with klebsiella. Pt started on PO Augmentin X5 days. Pt with BM 
X3 on HD5. Pt tolerated regular diet, OOB and ambulating, with 
decreased pain and distention with continued improvement over 
the next few days. Pt d/c'd home with VNA on HD8

     INDICATION:  S/P TAH/BSO 24 days ago with elevated white count and adrenal
     insufficiency evaluate for intra-abdominal collection.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3081-2-28**]
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained from the lung bases to the pubic
     symphysis prior to and following the administration of 150 cc of intravenous
     Optiray.
     
     CONTRAST:  No oral contrast was administered at the request of the referring
     clinician.  IV contrast only was administered.  Non-ionic contrast was used
     due to patient debility.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The lung bases
     appear unremarkable, with bibasilar dependent change.  The visualized portions
     of the heart and pericardium appear unremarkable.  There is again seen mild
     intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.  This appears slightly less prominent
     than at the time of the previous examination.  There is new pneumobilia.  The
     gallbladder is non-distended and contains innumerable calcified stones.  The
     common bile duct is non dilated.  There is stranding about the pancreatic head
     and a small area of fluid density adjacent to the second portion of the
     duodenum and the pancreatic head (series 4 image 34).  This measures 1.9 cm in
     greatest diameter.  The body and tail of the pancreas appear unremarkable. The
     spleen, and adrenal glands appear unremarkable. There are symmetric
     nephrograms bilaterally.  The appearance of the kidneys is unchanged from the
     recent previous CT, with multiple bilateral hypodense rounded lesions, many
     too small to accurately characterize. The largest of these, located within the
     upper pole of the left kidney, measures 2.3 x 2.4 cm (series 4 image 26).  The
     ureters are non-dilated.  The aorta is normal in caliber throughout.  There is
     no pathologic appearing mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  The
     small bowel loops are non-distended. There is fecalization of the contents of

     the small bowel within the terminal ileum.  Evaluation of the bowel wall is
     limited due to the lack of oral contrast in this examination, which was
     performed without contrast at the request of the referring clinician. Allowing
     for this, there is marked stranding and suggestion of bowel wall thickening
     about the cecum and ascending colon.  The remainder of the large bowel is
     decompressed and bowel wall thickness cannot be evaluated.  There is no free
     interperitoneal air.  An open anterior abdominal wound is seen within the
     subcutaneous tissues, with scattered foci of gas layering anterior to the
     abdominal fascia.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  No calcified stones
     are visualized on the initial non-contrast images within the bladder or distal
     ureters.  Post-contrast, the bladder, distal ureters, and vaginal stump appear
     unremarkable.  There is a small amount of fluid within the pelvis, layering
     between the loops of sigmoid mesentery. Possible mild thickening of the rectal
     wall.  No pathologic appearing pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy is
     identified.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Bone windows demonstrate no evidence of suspicious lytic or
     sclerotic osseous lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Interval development of stranding about the cecum and
     proximal ascending colon with suggestion of bowel wall edema.  No free air to
     suggest perforation. Although there is a suggestion of bowel wall edema. No
     diverticula are visualized, however the differential diagnosis of this finding
     includes diverticulitis, infectious or inflammatory colitis,including C.
     difficile colitis, or less likely or ischemia. Appendix is not visualized. The
     mesenteric vessels are well visualized and are patent proximally.
     
     2)  Stranding about the pancreatic head and probable small fluid collection
     about the pancreatic head and duodenum consistent with the patient's diagnosis
     of pancreatitis.
     
     3)  Gallstones and pneumobilia.  Slight decrease in intrahepatic biliary
     ductal dilatation.  Pneumobilia may relate to the given history of ERCP.
     
     4)  Bilateral renal cysts and additional hypodense lesions within the kidneys,
     too small to accurately characterize, but likely representing cysts.
     
     5)  Open surgical wound within the anterior abdominal wall.
     
     These findings were discussed with the E.D. resident caring for the patient at
     the time of interpretation.

     performed without contrast at the request of the referring clinician. Allowing
     for this, there is marked stranding and suggestion of bowel wall thickening
     about the cecum and ascending colon.  The remainder of the large bowel is
     decompressed and bowel wall thickness cannot be evaluated.  There is no free
     interperitoneal air.  An open anterior abdominal wound is seen within the
     subcutaneous tissues, with scattered foci of gas layering anterior to the
     abdominal fascia.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  No calcified stones
     are visualized on the initial non-contrast images within the bladder or distal
     ureters.  Post-contrast, the bladder, distal ureters, and vaginal stump appear
     unremarkable.  There is a small amount of fluid within the pelvis, layering
     between the loops of sigmoid mesentery. Possible mild thickening of the rectal
     wall.  No pathologic appearing pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy is
     identified.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Bone windows demonstrate no evidence of suspicious lytic or
     sclerotic osseous lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Interval development of stranding about the cecum and
     proximal ascending colon with suggestion of bowel wall edema.  No free air to
     suggest perforation. Although there is a suggestion of bowel wall edema. No
     diverticula are visualized, however the differential diagnosis of this finding
     includes diverticulitis, infectious or inflammatory colitis,including C.
     difficile colitis, or less likely or ischemia. Appendix is not visualized. The
     mesenteric vessels are well visualized and are patent proximally.
     
     2)  Stranding about the pancreatic head and probable small fluid collection
     about the pancreatic head and duodenum consistent with the patient's diagnosis
     of pancreatitis.
     
     3)  Gallstones and pneumobilia.  Slight decrease in intrahepatic biliary
     ductal dilatation.  Pneumobilia may relate to the given history of ERCP.
     
     4)  Bilateral renal cysts and additional hypodense lesions within the kidneys,
     too small to accurately characterize, but likely representing cysts.
     
     5)  Open surgical wound within the anterior abdominal wall.
     
     These findings were discussed with the E.D. resident caring for the patient at
     the time of interpretation.
     
                                                                 (Over)
