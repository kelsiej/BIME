Admission Date:  [**3298-9-6**]       Discharge Date:  [**3298-9-9**]

Date of Birth:   [**3215-1-28**]       Sex:  M

Service:  Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is an 83 year old
gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease, type 2
diabetes mellitus and osteomyelitis of his right foot in [**3297**]
with Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
Staphylococcus aureus, who was transferred from [**Hospital3 11659**] on [**3298-9-6**] to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1294**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5**] [**First Name (Titles) 6**]
[**Last Name (Titles) 7**] for an elevated white blood cell count, fever and
hypotension.  Previously that afternoon at [**Hospital3 11659**], Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] was found to be hypotensive with a blood
pressure of 70/40 with a white blood cell count of 31,000 and
right lower extremity cellulitis.

On arrival to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1294**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5**] [**First Name (Titles) 6**] [**Last Name (Titles) 7**], the
patient was afebrile with a temperature of 99.1, blood
pressure 112/49 on Dopamine, a pulse of 80, breathing at 20
and saturating at 97% in room air.  His physical examination
at that time was remarkable for conjunctival exudates, clear
lungs, sinus tachycardia and right lower extremity edema,
erythema and induration.

Admission white blood cell count was 28,100, hematocrit 31,
platelet count 164,000 with 83% polycytes and 10% bands.
Partial thromboplastin time was 42.1 and an INR of 4.2 on
admission.  Sodium was 132, potassium 5.2, chloride 100,
bicarbonate 27, BUN 39 and creatinine 1.9.  In the Emergency
Room, an electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm of 90 beats
per minute, first degree A-V block, T wave inversion in I and
AVL and T wave flattening in III and AVF.

The patient was admitted directly to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1294**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5**] [**First Name (Titles) 6**] [**Last Name (Titles) 7**] for
circulatory support with a Dopamine drip, with intravenous
antibiotics for presumed sepsis.  At that point, he was
treated with cefazolin.  In addition, the patient received a
total of five liters of intravenous fluid for cardiovascular
resuscitation.  His Coumadin was held at that time for an INR
of 4.2.  He was ruled out for a myocardial infarction by
cardiac enzymes.

In addition, the patient had lower extremity noninvasive
ultrasounds which were negative for deep vein thrombosis.  In
the Medical Intensive Care Unit at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1294**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5**]
[**First Name (Titles) 6**] [**Last Name (Titles) 7**], the patient's blood pressure rapidly resolved
and he was successfully weaned from the Dopamine drip within
12 hours.  With a stable blood pressure, he was transferred
to the floor for further management of his infection,
diabetes mellitus and blood pressure.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On arrival to the floor, Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] was
afebrile with a temperature of 98.6, blood pressure 116/60,
heart rate 82, respiratory rate 18 and oxygen saturation 94%
in room air.  General:  Pleasant, elderly appearing male
sitting upright in a chair, speaking with a visitor, in no
acute distress, appearing very comfortable.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat:  Normocephalic, atraumatic, pupils
equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation,
exotropia of both eyelids, left greater than right and
bilateral conjunctivitis, oropharynx moist and clear.  Neck:
No jugular venous distention appreciated, supple without
lymphadenopathy, no bruits.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate
and rhythm, pronounced S1, soft S2 and no mechanical click
appreciated, no murmur, rub or gallop.  Lungs:  Bilateral
bibasilar crackles but no wheezes or rhonchi.  Abdomen:
Soft, obese, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds,
no costovertebral angle tenderness.  Extremities:  3+ pitting
edema, erythema and warmth of right lower extremity
two-thirds of the way up the calf but no crepitus or
discoloration appreciated, no tenderness to palpation; both
feet were cool and there was good capillary refill in both
lower extremities.  Neurologic examination:  Alert and
oriented times three, moving all extremities symmetrically,
sensation grossly intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission to the medicine floor, white
blood cell count was 13.2, hematocrit 28.2, platelet count
131,000, INR 3, sodium 137, potassium 4.4, chloride 104,
bicarbonate 26, BUN 30, creatinine 1.3 and glucose 147.
Calcium, magnesium and phosphorous were normal.  Creatinine
kinase was 604.  Chest x-ray on [**3298-9-6**] showed a
subtle opacity in the right middle lobe without air
bronchograms, mild cardiomegaly but no congestive heart
failure; the right middle lobe opacity was of uncertain
significance.  A repeat PA and lateral film was obtained,
however, was not available for final read at the time of
discharge.

Urine culture on [**3298-9-6**] was negative.  Blood
cultures on the same day grew one out of four bottles of
group B streptococcus, the sensitivities of which were
pending at the time of discharge.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Infectious disease:  The patient was
switched to intravenous vancomycin 1 gram every 12 hours for
a history of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus in
the past of the same right lower extremity.  He received
approximately six doses of vancomycin, with improvement in
the erythema and edema of his right lower extremity.  As
mentioned earlier, the patient's blood cultures grew one out
of four bottles from [**3298-9-6**], group B streptococcus,
sensitivities of which were pending at the time of discharge.
In addition, the patient was continued to be treated with
erythromycin ointment for his conjunctivitis and he had a
follow-up chest x-ray for a questionable right middle lobe
infiltrate, the final read of which was not available by the
time of discharge.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient's blood pressure was stable,
running between 110 and 120/50 to 70 his entire time on the
floor.  He required no Dopamine or pressors.  He was
restarted on his Zestril and Coreg.  In addition, he was
continued on aspirin.

3.  Hematologic:  The patient has a history of a mitral valve
replacement with a mechanical valve, per the patient.  He was
being anticoagulated.  However, on the floor, his last INR
was 1.4 and his target should be 3.  At that point, he was
started on a heparin drip and, to bridge him to therapeutic
anticoagulation, warfarin.  This heparin drip was continued
at the time of transfer to [**Hospital1 **].

The patient, throughout his first day, was continued on a
warfarin dose of 5 mg at bedtime and, on the day of
discharge, was increased to 7.5 mg at bedtime every other day
alternating with 5 mg every other day, the dose that he
originally came in on.  In addition, during the interim, the
patient was treated with subcutaneous heparin for deep vein
thrombosis and pulmonary embolism prophylaxis.

4.  Endocrine:  The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus.  He
was covered with a regular insulin sliding scale on the floor
and restarted on his preadmission insulin dose of NPH 22
units in the morning and 6 units in the evening, and regular
insulin 8 units in the morning.  His blood sugars generally
ran between 150 and 320.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Sepsis and bacteremia with group B streptococcus.
2.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
bypass grafting and mitral valve replacement with mechanical
valve in [**3295**].
3.  Right lower extremity cellulitis, questionable
osteomyelitis.
4.  Diabetes mellitus.
5.  Anemia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Aspirin 325 mg p.o.q.d.
Coreg 12.5 mg p.o.b.i.d.
Colace 100 mg p.o.b.i.d.
Erythromycin 0.5% ophthalmic ointment one application
o.u.q.i.d.
Eucerin cream.
Heparin drip dosed to a partial thromboplastin time of 60 to
80 as bridge to an INR of 3.
Insulin NPH 22 units q.a.m. and 6 units q.p.m.
Regular insulin 8 units q.a.m.
Zestril 5 mg p.o.q.d.
Warfarin 5 mg p.o.q.o.d.
Warfarin 7.5 mg p.o.q.o.d.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.q.d.
Vancomycin 1 gm i.v.q.12h.

FOLLOW-UP PLAN:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is to be transferred back to
[**Hospital3 **].  There, he requires the following
interventions:

1.  Anticoagulation with a heparin drip for a target partial
thromboplastin time of 60 to 80 until INR can be brought up
to the target of 3 with his warfarin.
2.  Echocardiogram given group B streptococcus bacteremia and
history of mitral valve replacement with a mechanical valve
to rule out thrombus.
3.  Plain films and magnetic resonance imaging scan of right
foot in addition to an erythrocyte sedimentation rate to rule
out osteomyelitis of that foot.
4.  Prolonged antibiotics for the group B streptococcus
bacteremia and possible osteomyelitis.

     INDICATION:  83 y/o man with sepsis. Evaluate for infiltrate.
     
     A single AP upright portable chest radiograph was obtained without priors for
     comparison.
     
     The overall heart size is mildly enlarged and the patient is status post
     median sternotomy, CABG, and prosthestic valve replacement.  The pulmonary
     vascularity is within normal limits with no evidence of left heart failure.
     There is a slight density overlying the right middle lobe without evidence of
     air bronchograms.  There is linear atelectasis at the left lower lobe.  No
     pleural effusions are seen.  There is a question of bony deformity of the
     anterior rib cage on the right.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Subtle opacity in the right middle lobe without definite air bronchograms.
     Follow up radiographs are recommended to confirm or exclude developing
     infiltrate in this region.
     2. Cardiomegaly without evidence of left heart failure.

     INDICATION: Pain.
     
     COMPARISON: [**3298-9-6**]
     
     FINDINGS: Bilateral effusions are present especially evident on the lateral
     view, posteriorly. This was not as apparent at the left lateral costophrenic
     focus on the prior exam. In addition, the pulmonary vessels appear slightly
     more distended and this suggests exaccerbation of fluid overload. No definite
     infiltrate is seen. Fluid accumulates in the right major fissure. A congenital
     rib abnormality is incidentally seen on the right.
     
     The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but no different than prior. Prosthetic
     cadiac valve is noted. CABG changes are evident. Upper lungs are clear and
     there is no pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     Fluid overload slightly worse than prior. Subtle increase in density on the
     frontal view in the region of the right lower lobe but not well localized on
     the lateral view. Follow up recommended to see if this is an evolving process
     of manifestation of slight increase in pulmonary vascular markings.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      83 year old man with septicemia requiring prolonged Abx. Single lumen.          
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      PICC placement                                                                  
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Patient requires long-term antibiotics for bacteremia and right leg
     cellulitis.  IV was not possible to advance a PICC line.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed by Dr[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 752**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 89**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 90**], with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 6**], attending radiologist, being present and supervising the entire
     procedure. The left upper arm was prepped in a sterile fashion.  Since no
     suitable superficial veins were visible ultrasound was used for localization
     of a suitable vein. The basilic vein was of small caliber and the brachial
     vein was therefore visualized.  The brachial vein was patent and compressible.
     After local anesthesia with 2 ml of 1% Lidocaine, the brachial vein was
     entered under ultrasonographic guidance with a 21 g. needle.  A .018 guidewire
     was advanced under fluoroscopy into the superior vena cava.  Based on the
     markers on the guidewire it was determined that a length of 41 cm would be
     suitable. The PICC line was trimmed to the length and advanced over a 4 French
     introducer sheath under fluoroscopic guidance into the superior vena cava.
     The sheath was removed.  The catheter was flushed.  A final chest x-ray was
     obtained. The film demonstrates the tip to be in the superior vena cava just
     above the atrium.  The line is ready for use.
     
     A stat-lock was applied and the line was hep-locked.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 41 cm total length 4 French double
     lumen PICC line with tip in the superior vena cava, ready for use.
