Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted [**3430-10-28**] after severeal days of right upper 
and lower extremity weakness ultimately leading to lost of 
balance and head trauma s/p fall in shower. Head Ct in outside 
hospital revealex left frontal mass confirmed by repat CT in 
[**Hospital1 83**]. Dilantin loading dose 1gm to be followed by 100mg TID was 
initiated. Additionally Decadron 4mg Q6 hours along with MRI of 
the Head with and without contrast, Chest/Abdominal/Pelvic CT, 
bone scan, ESR, CRP, CEA ere added for work up.  MRI revealed 
Left frontal lobe mass along the medial aspect of the brain 
suggestive of a primary neoplasm glioblastoma appears more 
likely than oligodendroglioma. Pateint was preop and consented 
for resection of frontal lobe mass. Procedure was peformed 
[**3430-10-26**] without complication and transfered to PACU. Please see 
operative report for details. Postoperative day 2 [**3430-10-28**] @ 
1802 patient expired after suffering an episode of pulseless 
electrical activity (PEA). Family was notified and refused 
option of autopsy for death evaluation.

     INDICATION:  CT torso.
     
     INDICATION:  Left frontal lobe mass for primary cancer.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT of the torso was performed from the thoracic inlet up to the
     pelvis with injection of intravenous and oral contrast.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.  Prominent
     azygous fissure is noted.  Ground glass opacities are noted in the right
     middle lobe with peribronchial thickening.  Tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 3927**] opacities are noted in
     the left lower lobe.  The airways are patent up to the subsegmental bronchi.
     There are no pleural or pericardial effusions.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  There is a 2.8 x 3 cm lesion in the right lobe of
     the liver, which shows increasing peripheral enhancement on delayed scans and
     is consistent with a hemangioma.  Small hypodense lesions are noted within the
     both kidneys which are 6-7 mm, too small to characterize.  The gallbladder,
     pancreas, spleen and adrenals are unremarkable.  There is no intraabdominal
     lymphadenopathy.  There is no ascites or free abdominal air. The bowel is
     unremarkable.
     
     No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are seen in the bones.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Ground-glass opacities in the right middle lobe with peribronchial
     thickening and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 3927**] opacity in the left lower lobe consistent with
     nonspecific inflammation/infection.
     2.  Hemangioma in the right lobe of the liver.

     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with diagnosis of brain mass for further
     evaluation.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR, susceptibility and diffusion
     axial images obtained before gadolinium.  T1 axial and coronal images obtained
     following gadolinium.  There are no prior similar examinations for comparison.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is an area of brain edema in the left frontal lobe.  There is
     an irregular area of enhancement identified in the medial left frontal lobe
     measuring approximately 3 cm in size with several rim-enhancing areas and a
     small nodular component.  The susceptibility images demonstrate blood products
     of chronic and subacute nature.  There is no evidence of slow diffusion
     identified in the cystic component of the mass.  There is mass effect on the
     left lateral ventricle.  There is no hydrocephalus.  There are no other
     enhancing lesions identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Left frontal lobe mass along the medial aspect of the brain
     demonstrating blood products of various ages.  The mass is suggestive of a
     primary neoplasm.  Given the deep location, glioblastoma appears more likely
     than oligodendroglioma.

     left lateral ventricle.  There is no hydrocephalus.  There are no other
     enhancing lesions identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Left frontal lobe mass along the medial aspect of the brain
     demonstrating blood products of various ages.  The mass is suggestive of a
     primary neoplasm.  Given the deep location, glioblastoma appears more likely
     than oligodendroglioma.

     COMPARISON:  CT of the torso from [**3430-10-23**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     thoracic inlet to the lung bases with multiplanar reconstructions.
     
     CONTRAST:  100 cc of IV Optiray contrast were administered due to the rapid
     rate of bolus injection required for this study.
     
     CTA OF THE CHEST:  No filling defects or pulmonary emboli identified within
     the pulmonary arterial system to the level of the segmental branches.  The
     aorta demonstrates normal caliber and contour, without any filling defects.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The lung window images demonstrate
     scattered emphysematous changes.  There is an azygos lobe.  The previously
     noted tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 3927**] opacities within the right middle lobe are less prominent,
     likely representing interval improvement in the nonspecific
     inflammation/infection.  Soft tissue window images demonstrate secretions
     within the bronchi bilaterally.  Additionally, the ET tube is seen with the
     tip positioned at the carina.  No pathologically enlarged mediastinal or hilar
     lymphadenopathy is seen.  There is a miniscule amount of air adjacent to the
     anterior aspect of the right fourth rib, in association with a rib fracture.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Right rib fracture.  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions
     identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No pulmonary embolism.
     2.  Right fourth rib fracture, likely from resuscitative efforts.

     FINDINGS:  There is evidence of a left frontal craniotomy.  The somewhat
     high-density lesion in the mid portion of the left frontal lobe is no longer
     demonstrated.  Some of the higher density material representing hemorrhage is
     still seen.  There is some gas seen within the operative bed.  There is
     obliteration of the basal cisterns and indistinctness of the sulci especially
     on the right side.  The right lateral ventricle is not obliterated nor is the
     right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 234**].  Nonetheless, the appearance suggests rather generalized
     cerebral edema, which has increased compared to the previous examination.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage.  Findings consistent
     with increased intracranial pressure compared to the previous study.
