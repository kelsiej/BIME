     Reason: CAROTID BRUITS
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     REASON:  Bruits.
     
     FINDINGS:  Duplex evaluation is performed of both carotid arteries.
     Significant plaque was identified on the right internal carotid artery.  On
     the left minimal plaque was noted.
     
     On the right the peak systolic over diastolis velocity in the internal carotid
     artery is 416/137.  In the remainder of the vessel the peak systolic
     velocities are 57, 397 in the CCA, ECA respectively.  The ICA:CCA ratio is
     7.3.  This is consistent with an 80-99% stenosis.
     
     On the left peak systolic velocities are 70, 67, 56 in the ICA, CCA, ECA
     respectively.  The ICA:CCA ratio is 1.  This is consistent with less than 40%
     stenosis.
     
     There is antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Significant right-sided plaque with an 80-99% carotid stenosis.
     On the left there is a less than 40% carotid stenosis.

7.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on chest x-ray.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  1.  Right lower extremity squamous
cell carcinoma, excision in [**2691**]; 2.  Bilateral cataract
surgery; 3.  Appendectomy at the age of 18; 4.  Right total
hip replacement at age [**Age over 90 **].

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to Celebrex/rash and
adhesive tape.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Multivitamin
2.  Metamucil
3.  Eyedrops, Betagan .5%
4.  Fosamax 70 mg per week
5.  Prozac 10 mg suspension q.d.
6.  Atenolol 25 mg q.d.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 19 year old
lady with diverticuli, osteoporosis who was found to have 80
to 99% right carotid stenosis and right-sided visual
symptoms.  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 2460**] on [**7-20**] and underwent right carotid
endarterectomy the same day.  The operation went without
complications.  The patient was brought to the Vascular
Intensive Care Unit.  The next day, the patient's Foley
catheter was removed.  Her central line was replaced with
peripheral intravenous.  The patient was allowed to ambulate.
On postoperative day #1 the patient was febrile, vital signs
were stable.  The patient was not taking good p.o. and in
general felt weak and it was decided to keep her in the
hospital an extra day.  On postoperative day #2 the patient
still felt kind of weak and had a couple episodes of nausea,
a small amount of emesis.  The emesis had no bright red blood
and no coffee grounds.  The patient also had an episode of
urinary retention and on straight catch was found to have 400
cc of clear urine her bladder which was sent for urinalysis
which was negative.  Electrocardiogram was performed during
one episode of nausea which showed no ischemic changes and no
changes from her baseline, however, due to patient condition
it was decided to keep her in the hospital.  The complete
blood count and electrolytes were performed in the evening of
postoperative day #2.  The patient was found to have swelling
under her incision, right side of neck.  The patient had no
changes and her neurological examination was alert and
oriented times three.  The patient had an ultrasound
performed and was found to have no signs of pseudoaneurysm.
Her laboratory data from that evening included white blood
cells of 6.4, hematocrit 25.1, platelets 333, sodium 126,
potassium 3.6, chloride 90, bicarbonate 27, BUN 10,
creatinine .5 and blood sugar of 100.  The patient was
transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.  The patient
was put on a monitor and started on intravenous fluids and
normal saline with 20 mEq of potassium at 60 mEq/hr plus salt
pills.  The patient was also transfused 20 units of red blood
cells.  On postoperative day #4, the patient's creatinine
went up to 29.9.  Her sodium was 133, potassium 3.4 which was
repleted with oral potassium.  The patient remained in
Intensive Care Unit, however, was switched to floor status.
The patient was allowed to ambulate bed-to-chair around the
room with assistance.  The patient still has no neurological
symptoms and is alert and oriented times three and reported
feeling much better.  Improved appetite.  [**Last Name **] problem
urinating.  The patient was found in satisfactory condition
and was discharged [**2691-7-25**].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Metamucil
2.  Betagan .5% q.h.s.
3.  Fosamax 70 mg q. week
4.  Prozac 10 mg suspension q. day
5.  Atenolol 25 mg q.d.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is to be discharged home with
Visiting Nurse Association services for wound care.  The
patient is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 93**] in seven to ten
days.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Right carotid stenosis, status post right carotid
endarterectomy
2.  Hyponatremia
3.  Hypokalemia

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  [**Age over 90 **] year old female status post carotid endarterectomy, now with a
     new hematoma at the surgical site.  Assess for pseudoaneurysm.
     
     FINDINGS:  Note this is a portable examination, limited to the area of
     interest on the patient's right neck.  In the region corresponding to the
     patient's palpable abnormality, there is increased subcutaneous soft tissue
     echogenicity, which likely represents a subcutaneous hematoma.  The
     posteriorly positioned external/internal and common carotid arteries
     demonstrate no communication with this collection.  No abnormal blood flow is
     visualized.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Neck hematoma.  Limited portable exam demonstrates no evidence of
     a pseudoaneurysm corresponding to the patient's palpable abnormality.

     study there has been an interval right sided end arterectomy. Currently, no
     plaque or wall thickening is seen involving the right carotid system, the peak
     systolic velocities on the right are within normal limits as are the ICA to

     On the left there is minimal heterogenous calcified ICA plaque. The peak
     systolic velocities  on the left are 59, 50 and 56 cm per second in the ICA,
     CCA and ECA respectively.  The ICA to CCA ratio is 1.2.  Findings indicate no
     significant left ICA stenosis.

     FINDINGS: By previous report, this patient has undergone endarterectomy,
     presumed to be on the right.  Currently, there is no wall thickening or plaque
     involving the right ICA or CCA.  Peak systolic velocities on the right 60, 57,
     and 135 cm/s for the ICA, CCA, and ECA respectively.  There is moderate
     calcific right ECA plaque which may account for a bruit on physical exam.
     
     Minimal heterogeneous calcified plaque at the origin of the ICA.  The peak
     systolic velocity on the left is 71, 62, and 44 cm/s for the ICA, CCA, and ECA
     respectively.  The findings indicate no significant left ICA stenosis.  There
     is antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.
