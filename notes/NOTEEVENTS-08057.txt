Admission Date:  [**3198-7-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**3198-7-30**]

Date of Birth:   [**3149-5-23**]     Sex:  M

Service:  .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known patient firstname **] [**Known patient lastname **] is a 49 year
old gentleman with a 22 year history of diabetes mellitus.
He has a history of peripheral neuropathy, kidney
transplantation in [**3191**] secondary to diabetic nephropathy, as
well as throat cancer in [**3192**] treated with local resection
and radical neck dissection on the left as well as
postoperative radiation.  Mr.  [**Known patient lastname **] also had signs and
symptoms consistent with cervical myelopathy; a cervical MRI
scan showed very impressive disc herniations at C5-C6, less
so at C4-C5, with clear cut cord compression, particularly on
the right side C5-C6.  Therefore, he was admitted for C4-C5
and C5-C6 anterior diskectomy with autologous bone graft and
instrumented fusion.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Postoperative physical examination
demonstrated that he was afebrile at 97 degrees; blood
pressure 145/80; pulse 60; respiratory rate 10; 100% on a
non-rebreather.  He was awake, alert, uncomfortable secondary
to incisional tenderness at neck site as well as right iliac
graft site.  The wounds were clean, dry and intact, and flat.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  While in the PACU, Anesthesia was called
because the patient became dyspneic and tachypneic and his
SAO2 dropped to 89%.  His respiratory rate was 30 on face
mask.  Interoperatively, he was positive two liters with a
stable blood pressure and heart rate, although requiring some
neo-synephrine interoperatively.  He responded to intravenous
Lasix with 3.2 liters of urine output as well as marked
clinical improvement.

The etiology for his congestive heart failure was determined
likely to be diastolic dysfunction from increased heart rate
as well as excess volume.  No definite evidence for
significant myocardial ischemia, although cardiac enzymes
were sent and he ruled out for myocardial infarction.

He was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit where his
respiratory and cardiac status was monitored carefully.  He
was given Lasix to continue to diurese the excess volume.  He
was also put on Lopressor 150 mg twice a day.  Also in the
Intensive Care Unit, O2 saturation was closely monitored.
The patient became agitated with both tent and [**Hospital1 381**]
machine, although continued to saturate well.

He was transferred to Medicine the morning of [**3198-7-27**], for
continued medical management post surgery.  On the day of
transfer, the patient was noted to be confused with waxing
and [**Doctor Last Name 36**] sensorium; thus, a delirium work-up was initiated
looking for precipitants.
1.  When his O2 saturation was monitored, his pulse oximetry
remained in the 90s during his stay.
2.  His non-essential medications that may have been
contributing to his change in mental status were
discontinued; those included Temocillin, Nortriptyline,
Haldol, Lorazepam, Venlafaxine, Bupropion, and Gabapentin.
In addition, his cyclosporin levels were checked.
3.  Hypo or hyperglycemia:  [**Last Name (un) **] had been following with
their appreciated recommendations on glucose control.  Finger
sticks were in the 150s when acutely agitated, therefore, it
was not determined that glucose levels were contributory.
4.  Infectious causes were evaluated.  He was febrile in the
Intensive Care Unit to 101.0 F.; yet, chest x-ray, blood
cultures, urinalysis and urine cultures were all negative for
sources.  A lumbar puncture was considered, although not
performed due to the fact that the cerebrospinal fluid was
not breached during the procedure.
5.  Mass effect was considered, although no focal deficits
were ever noted on examination and due to the fluctuating
sensorium, it was determined that there was no severe
underlying structural abnormality.  A head and neck CT scan,
non-contrast, were ordered though to evaluate for such
processes.  No acute intracranial hemorrhages or midline
shifts were noted, although a soft tissue mass was noted at
the level of C2.  This was determined to be within the normal
expected changes post surgery.
6.  Trauma was also considered.  The patient was found out of
bed but no signs of head trauma, no loss of consciousness.
Throughout his stay, Chem-10 was monitored.  There were no
electrolytes or mineral abnormalities that could explain his
delirium.  Liver function tests were checked, only total
bilirubin was slightly elevated at 1.6.  TSH was within
normal limits as was B12 and folate.  RPR evaluating for
possible neurologic syphilis was also checked.  The assay was
nonreactive.  An EEG was also considered to rule out
non-convulsive status epilepticus, although again this did
not seem to be a likely cause.

On the evening of the 22nd, the patient became acutely
agitated, threatening to leave, and also threatening to harm
those nurses and physicians that were attempting to prevent
him from leaving.  Security was notified who then arrived to
the room and helped to place the patient in four-point
restraints, for the safety of both the patient and the staff
of the hospital.  The restraints were weaned off overnight
although he became acutely agitated and they were replaced
early on [**7-28**].

Later in the morning on [**7-28**], the patient was more oriented
and alert, and asked to have the restraints removed.  They
were taken off two at a time.  The patient continued to do
well and did not require restraints after that event.

Intramuscular as well as intravenous Haldol were ordered
p.r.n. for emergency use should he become acutely agitated.
haldol as well as the restraints were not required after the
morning of the 23rd.

Each progressive day, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 11108**] delirium abated with
return to baseline mental status early on [**7-29**].  The
likely cause of the delirium was a combination of surgery and
Intensive Care Unit stay in addition to poly-pharmacy.

Other concerns during his stay was his kidney function, due
to his renal transplant in [**3191**].  His immunosuppressive
therapy was continued throughout his stay; his creatinine
remained approximately 2.3 to 2.4; he has a baseline renal
insufficiency.  With this in mind, when obtaining a CT scan
it was determined that contrast would not be the best option.
While the patient was in restraints, gentle hydration was
initiated since p.o. intake was not adequate.

As for his diabetes mellitus, the [**Last Name (un) **] Team provided
updated recommendations each day, adjusting for the changing
p.o. intake.

The only other complaints from Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] during his stay
were:  Soreness at his operative sites, for which he was
given p.r.n. Tylenol once his delirium had resolved.  In
addition, he also complained of difficulty with swallowing,
necessitating only soft and liquid diet.  This was attributed
to postoperative swelling and changes from his diskectomy
performed [**3198-7-24**].

     CT OF THE C SPINE [**3198-8-11**].
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  49 year old man with spinal fusion.  Status post fall
     with loss of consciousness.  History of C5-6 fusion.  Evaluate for fracture.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     skull base through the lung apices without the administration of IV contrast.
     In addition, sagittal and coronal reconstructions were performed.
     
     FINDINGS:  The patient is status post anterior fusion of C4, C5 and C6.  The
     hardware appears well positioned and there is no evidence of hardware failure.
     The overall alignment of the cervical spine is normal.  There is preservation
     of the vertebral body heights and no acute fractures or dislocations are
     identified.  There are degenerative changes noted with diffuse disc space
     narrowing.  The prevertebral soft tissues are normal.  There are vascular
     calcifications involving the vertebral and carotid arteries.  The lung bases
     are clear.  There is a small amount of fluid attenuation in the mastoid air
     cells on the right.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No CT evidence of acute fracture or dislocation in this patient
     status post C3-C5 fusion.

     MR SCAN OF THE BRAIN:
     
     HISTORY:  Evaluate for stroke.  Syncope.  Known throat cancer and C6-7 fusion.
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2 weighted brain imaging was obtained
     including the use of diffusion weighted images.
     
     FINDINGS:  The diffusion weighted scans are within normal limits.  There is a
     punctate focus of water signal intensity within the posterior aspect of the
     right lentiform nucleus which, even in retrospect is not visible on recent
     head CT scan of [**3198-7-29**].  The finding probably represents a chronic lacunar
     infarction.  There is no other sign of brain ischemic change, either acute or
     chronic, identified.  There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline
     structures.  There is no area of abnormal susceptibility within the brain. The
     area of questionable soft tissue thickening anterior to the C2 body, as noted
     on the prior CT scan scout film was likely an artifact.
     
     CONCLUSION:  No sign of acute ischemia of the brain.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  History of TB and atypical microbacterial infection of left
     olecranon bursa, evaluate for bone involvement.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar imaging was performed through the left elbow, with
     axial and sagittal T1 fat sat images obtained before and after administration
     of gadolinium IV contrast.  Comparison is made to the prior radiograph dated
     [**3198-10-21**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There is extensive infiltration of the subcutaneous fat surrounding
     the olecranon bursa with abnormal low T1 and high T2 signal.  There is only a
     small amount of high T2 signal fluid within the olecranon bursa.  Abnormal
     signal does not extend deep to the superficial fascia in this region.  The
     underlying triceps tendon, olecranon, ulnar nerve, and muscles are all of
     normal signal and without evidence of destruction.
     
     There is trace high T2 signal edema within the fat between the radial head and
     proximal ulna, adjacent to the insertion of the biceps tendon on the radial
     tubercle.  This is not contiguous with the abnormality in the subcutaneous fat
     over the olecranon, howeever.
     
     After the administration of gadolinium, there is extensive enhancement in the
     same region of subcutaneous fat that shows the abnormal signal over the
     olecranon.  The bursa shows uniform rim enhancement.  There is no abnormal
     enhancement deep to the superficial fascia to suggest involvement of bone,
     muscle, tendon, or joint space.
     
     Elbow joint fluid is within normal limits.  Ulnar and radial collateral
     ligaments are intact.  Biceps, triceps, common extensor, and common flexor
     tendons are all normal.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Inflammatory change surrounding olecranon bursa is limited to the
     subcutaneous fat.  There is no evidence of osteomyelitis or other deep
     infection.  Olecranon bursa contains only a small amount of fluid.
     
     2)  Trace edema adjacent to insertion of biceps tendon on radial tubercle is
     not contiguous with the inflammation around the olecranon bursa and is
     unlikely of clinical significance.
     
     
                                                                 (Over)

      49 year old man with renal transplant and osteoarticular tuberculosis evaluate
      for intrathoracic disease
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      49 year old osteoarticular tuberculosis and pleural rub evaluate for
      intrathoracic disease
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Osteoarticular tuberculosis and pleural rub.  Evaluate for
     intrathoracic evidence of TB.
     
     The heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits and
     stable compared to previous studies dating back to [**3196-10-30**].
     
     There is an ill-defined somewhat rounded opacity in the left lower lung zone
     overlying the 5th anterior left rib at the intersection with the 9th posterior
     left rib.  This is not clearly seen on the lateral view.  It is uncertain
     whether this is related to the rib or adjacent pleura.
     
     The lungs reveal minimal linear opacity at the right lung base and are
     otherwise clear.  Note is made of slight thickening of the right anterior
     major fissure, new from earlier study of [**3196-10-30**].  There is an
     apparent coronary artery stent present.
     
     Skeletal structures reveal numerous healed left rib fractures and post-
     surgical changes in the lower cervical spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
      Ill-defined opacity in left lower lung zone measuring approximately 2.8 cm in
     diameter, overlying the junction of the 5th anterior and 9th posterior rib.
     There are several healed rib fractures present, in this region, and is
     uncertain whether this is related to a skeletal abnormality or an abnormality
     of the underlying pleura. Considering evidence of osteoarticular tuberculosis
     elsewhere, consider chest CT for more complete characterization of this
     region, as discussed with the referring physician.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Chronic erythema of the left ring finger.
     
     COMPARISON: MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**3198-5-14**].
     
     TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1, T2 weighted images of the left hand were obtained
     without and with IV contrast.
     
     CONTRAST:  20 cc of Gadolinium administered intravenously.
     
     MR LEFT HAND WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: The 4th flexor digitorum profundus
     and superficialis tendons are surrounded by extensive abnormal soft tissue
     signal starting at the DIP joint and extending proximally to mid metacarpal.
     It is well defined and somewhat lobulated in contour.  It is somewhat
     heterogeneous on both T1 and T2 weighted signal intensities with a somewhat
     granular lace-like appearance.  Upon contrast administration it demonstrates
     heterogeneous enhancement which is somewhat more prominent in the periphery.
     There is no associated bone marrow abnormal signal. The adjacent soft tissue
     also appears unremarkable.
     
     When comparison is made to the prior study, there is no significant interval
     change.
     
     IMPRESSION: Abnormal enhancing soft tissue surrounding the 4th finger flexor
     digitorum tendons most consistent with chronic inflammatory process.  No
     significant interval change since the prior study.

      49 year old man with renal transplantation hx with shell-fishing-related
      trauma to finger and subsequent 2 joint mycobacterial infection and pleural
      based opacity on recent cxr
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      osteoarticular mycobacterial disease, possible pleural based opacity by recent
      CXR please evaluate for mass, infection, scarring, rib fx
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  History of renal transplant. Microbacterial disease involving the
     joints. Evaluate opacity seen on chest X-ray.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired axial images were obtained from the thoracic
     inlet through the lung bases without contrast using 5 mm collimation.
     
     CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST:  A few tiny subcentimeter lymph nodes are seen in a
     right paratracheal, prevascular, and AP window location. The heart size is
     normal. There are coronary artery calcifications. There are no pleural or
     pericardial effusions.
     
     Reviews of lung windows demonstrate small focal area of air space opacity in
     the right middle lobe containing air bronchogram.
     
     There are healing fractures involving the left 7th and 8th posterior ribs.
     This accounts for the nodular opacity seen at the left base on recent chest X-
     ray.
     
     In the imaged portions of the upper abdomen, the unenhanced liver,
     gallbladder, adrenal glands, spleen, and pancreatic tail are unremarkable. The
     patient's native kidneys are atrophic.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Left lower lobe opacity seen on recent chest X-ray is related to healed
     posterior rib fractures on the left.
     2) Focal opacity with air bronchograms in the right middle lobe. In the proper
     clinical setting, this could represent an area of pneumonia. Alternatively, it
     could reflect a more chronic inflammatory process. No endobronchial lesions
     are seen.

     PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Comparison is made with the prior plain film
     of the chest performed [**3198-11-23**] and CT of the chest performed
     [**3198-11-27**].  The heart size is within normal limits with a left
     ventricular configuration.  Pulmonary vasculature and mediastinal contour are
     within normal limits.  Two rounded opacities are again noted overlying the
     left mid and lower lung zone consistent with previously described posterior
     rib fractures.  There has been interval resolution in the right middle lobe
     opacity.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Interval resolution of right middle lobe infiltrate.  No evidence
     of failure or area of consolidation.
