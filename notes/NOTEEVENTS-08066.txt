CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever and abdominal pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72-year-old
white male with a history of hypertension, Type 2 diabetes
mellitus who in the last two weeks has undergone two
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for biliary
obstruction secondary to choledocholithiasis. Approximately
two weeks earlier the patient had experienced nausea and
vomiting, was seen at [**Hospital 1922**] Hospital. He underwent
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with biliary
stone extraction and sphincterotomy on [**3443-3-23**]. He was
discharged home after the endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography however, he returned to the hospital
with nausea and vomiting and jaundice with new onset ascites.
His T Bili was elevated. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 74**] for endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography which he underwent on [**3443-3-31**], this
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography noted
diffusely edematous duodenal wall and major papilla with
tapering of the distal CVD and intrahepatic ductal
dilatation. Findings raised concern for a small bowel
microperforation. The patient was transferred back to [**Hospital 934**]
Hospital where he was treated with antibiotics and discharged
home on Levaquin. However, the patient continued to
experience recurrent fever with nausea and abdominal pain and
presented to [**Hospital1 75**] on [**3443-4-7**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. Type 2 Diabetes mellitus.
3. Biliary obstruction, status post sphincterotomy, stone
   removal on [**3443-3-23**], status post endoscopic retrograde
   cholangiopancreatography with CVD stent placement on
   [**3443-3-31**].


ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Paxil.
2. Lasix.
3. Glyburide.
4. Spironolactone.
5. Flomax.
6. Lisinopril.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone, wife was recently
deceased a few weeks before presentation. The patient reports
a 30 pack year smoking history, he quit tobacco in [**3408**]. He
denies alcohol or other elicit drug use.

REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  On presentation the patient reports
fever, chills, nausea, with some vomiting and abdominal pain.
He denies recent chest pain, shortness of breath or
lightheadedness.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general the patient is elderly, he
appears ill. Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat: Pupils equal,
round and reactive to light and accommodation. No scleral
icterus, jugular venous distension, no lymphadenopathy noted.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm without murmur noted.
Lungs: Mild crackles at the bases bilaterally. Abdomen:
Moderately distended, soft, diffuse mild tenderness without
rebound or guarding. Vital signs: Temperature 103.0, pulse
87, blood pressure 94/55, respiratory rate 18, O2 sat 100% on
three liters nasal cannula.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  As above the patient presented to
[**Hospital1 75**] with complaints of fever
with chills, nausea and abdominal pain. The vital signs
obtained revealed the patient to be extremely febrile with
hypotension and with a distended diffusely tender abdomen.
The patient was admitted to the medical service with the
diagnosis of sepsis secondary to recent endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography instrumentation. He was started on
broad spectrum antibiotics, fluid resuscitation was initiated
and he was admitted to the medical intensive care unit
service. The patient was started on intravenous antibiotics
and fluid resuscitation. The patient remained stable in
intensive care unit. The surgical team was consulted on [**3443-4-7**] and a paracentesis of the patient's ascitic
peritoneal fluid was obtained, cultures were sent for
specimen. A CT of the patient's abdomen and pelvis revealed
diffuse pancreatitis with ascites. The patient continued to
remainclinically stable. His fever defervesced, his blood pressue
normalized with systolic pressures consistently in the 120's.
He was transferred out of the unit on [**4-8**] to the floor. He
did well overnight of [**4-8**] on the floor with the
nasogastric tube still in place to wall suction. On the
morning of [**4-9**] with the patient afebrile, in no pain,
mentating well and requesting to have his nasogastric tube
removed. The nasogastric tube was removed, the patient seemed
to tolerate this well. However, in the afternoon of [**3443-4-9**]
the patient after consuming some liquids the patient
complained of increasing abdominal pain with nausea and
vomiting. It was noted that he became hypotensive with
systolic pressures into the 70's, fluid resuscitation was
initiated by the medical service and the patient's pressure
only responded transiently. He was transferred to the Unit to
initiate more aggressive resuscitative efforts and a repeat CT
scan of the abdomen and pelvis.  Ongoing surgical consultation
service saw the patient in the Intensive careunit it was felt
that the patient on examination showed signs of altered mental
status, he complained of severe abdominal pain. On examination he
was noted to have rebound with involuntary guarding and
peritonitis. The CT scan revealed air throughout the pancreas
raising the suspicion for necrosis of the patient's pancreas. He
was quickly taken to the operating room after consent was
obtained, the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy and
necrotic infected pancreatitis was found and debridement was
initiated.  During this exploration of the patient's abdomen it
was noted that he had widespread necrosis of his pancreas and he
became markedly unstable during the latter portions of the
procedure.  After resuscitative efforts were initiated, in
combination with the surgical and anesthesia team a ACLS protocol
was initiated, resuscitative efforts continued for for 3-4 hours
before the patient's condition became unsalvageable and he died.

The patient's family was notified, the medical examiner as
well was notified and appropriate steps were taken following
the patient's death.


FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Necrotizing infected pancreatitis
2. Septic shock
3. Mulitorgan system failure
4. Diabetes
5. Coronary artery disease

     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector phase array images were obtained from the thoracic
     inlet through the pubic symphysis.  No intravenous contrast was administered.
     
     CT CHEST WITHOUT ORAL, WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Soft tissue imaging is
     limited secondary to the lack of intravenous contrast. The heart, pericardium,
     and great vessels are normal in caliber and contour. There is no bulky
     mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy.  There is no pleural or
     pericardial effusion.  Both lungs show dependent changes at the bases without
     nodules or masses.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT ORAL, WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is decreased
     attenuation of the pancreatic body, tail, and head with a significant amount
     of peripancreatic soft tissue stranding, and free fluid.  Air within the
     pancreatic duct is consistent with previous ERCP.  Additionally, biliary stent
     extends from the right intrahepatic duct to the level of the duodenum.  Focal
     air within the central intrahepatic biliary tree is consistent with prior
     instrumentation.  Imaging of intraabdominal organs is severely limited
     secondary to the lack of intravenous contrast.  The liver is homogeneous
     without focal nodules or masses.  Bilateral adrenals, bilateral kidneys, and
     intra-abdominal loops of large and small bowel are grossly unremarkable. There
     is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  There is no free air.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT ORAL, WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Low-density free
     fluid extends from the abdomen down into the pelvis.  Foley catheter is seen
     within collapsed bladder.  Contrast from a presumed prior CT study is seen in
     multiple diverticuli within the sigmoid, and ascending colon.  There are small
     bilateral fat containing inguinal hernias.  There is no inguinal or pelvic
     lymphadenopathy.  There is no free air.

                                     FINAL REPORT *ABNORMAL!
     INDICATION:  72-year-old man with hypotension and abdominal pain status post
     ERCP.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector phase array images were obtained from the thoracic
     inlet through the pubic symphysis.  No intravenous contrast was administered.
     
     CT CHEST WITHOUT ORAL, WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Soft tissue imaging is
     limited secondary to the lack of intravenous contrast. The heart, pericardium,
     and great vessels are normal in caliber and contour. There is no bulky
     mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy.  There is no pleural or
     pericardial effusion.  Both lungs show dependent changes at the bases without
     nodules or masses.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT ORAL, WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is decreased
     attenuation of the pancreatic body, tail, and head with a significant amount
     of peripancreatic soft tissue stranding, and free fluid.  Air within the
     pancreatic duct is consistent with previous ERCP.  Additionally, biliary stent
     extends from the right intrahepatic duct to the level of the duodenum.  Focal
     air within the central intrahepatic biliary tree is consistent with prior
     instrumentation.  Imaging of intraabdominal organs is severely limited
     secondary to the lack of intravenous contrast.  The liver is homogeneous
     without focal nodules or masses.  Bilateral adrenals, bilateral kidneys, and
     intra-abdominal loops of large and small bowel are grossly unremarkable. There
     is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  There is no free air.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT ORAL, WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Low-density free
     fluid extends from the abdomen down into the pelvis.  Foley catheter is seen
     within collapsed bladder.  Contrast from a presumed prior CT study is seen in
     multiple diverticuli within the sigmoid, and ascending colon.  There are small
     bilateral fat containing inguinal hernias.  There is no inguinal or pelvic
     lymphadenopathy.  There is no free air.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Diffuse degenerative changes are seen along the thoracic and
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:  72-year-old man with recent ERCP, with ascites.  Please do
     Doppler of the portal flow.
     
     COMPARISONS:  None. Prior ultrasound guided biopsy only.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Right upper quadrant ultrasound.
     
     FINDINGS:  The examination is somewhat limited by body habitus.  There is
     equivocal intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, as well as definite
     dilatation of the extrahepatic common bile duct up to 11 mm in diameter.  The
     echotexture of the liver is difficult to evaluate on this study but is perhaps
     slightly coarse.  No focal lesions are identified.  There is ascites
     surrounding the liver.
     
     There are multiple small shadowing stones in the gallbladder.  The gallbladder
     is partly contracted, not distended.  There is slight wall thickening with
     edema, which can be seen in intrinsic liver disease, such as hepatitis,
     hypoproteinemia, CHF, or other edematous states.  Cholecystitis is less likely
     because of the lack of distention.  There is no pericholecystic fluid
     collection, although slight wall edema is seen.  The main, right, left portal
     veins demonstrate appropriate hepatopetal flow.
     
     Of note, image 34 shows a color Doppler image apparently without flow in the
     left portal vein, but the subsequent image shows normal flow, confirming that
     this represents an artifact.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Probably slight coarse hepatic echotexture.
     
     2)  Extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, with likely intrahepatic biliary
     ductal dilatation as well.
     
     3)  Ascites.
     
     4)  Minimal gallbladder wall thickening, but no distention.
     
     5)  Cholelithiasis.

     collection, although slight wall edema is seen.  The main, right, left portal
     veins demonstrate appropriate hepatopetal flow.
     
     Of note, image 34 shows a color Doppler image apparently without flow in the
     left portal vein, but the subsequent image shows normal flow, confirming that
     this represents an artifact.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Probably slight coarse hepatic echotexture.
     
     2)  Extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, with likely intrahepatic biliary
     ductal dilatation as well.
     
     3)  Ascites.
     
     4)  Minimal gallbladder wall thickening, but no distention.
     
     5)  Cholelithiasis.
     
     6)  Appropriate hepatopetal flow of the main portal vein and its primary
     branches.
                                                                 (Over)

     NG tube is in stomach.  There are low lung volumes.  Allowing for this, heart
     size is borderlined.  There are bibasilar opacities consistent with
     atelectases and possible associated small pleural effusions, essentially
     unchanged since the prior film of April of the same date if allowance is made
     for technical differences.  No pneumothorax, and no evidence for CHF.

     There are low lung volumes.  Allowing for this, heart size is normal.  Again
     demonstrated are bibasilar atelectases, slightly increased since the prior
     film of [**3443-4-8**] and there is now partial obscuration of the left

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     HISTORY:  Hypotension, abdominal pain, and rigid abdomen.  History of ERCP
     with duodenal microperforation.
     
     COMPARISON:  Torso CT of [**3443-4-6**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial multidetector CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were
     obtained with oral gastrografin.  Intravenous contrast was withheld secondary
     to the patient's poor renal function.
     
     ABDOMEN CT WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There are small bilateral pleural effusions and
     associated bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right.  No pericardial
     effusion is identified.  There is a moderate-sized hiatal hernia.
     
     Oral contrast opacifies the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and proximal small
     bowel.  However, the duodenum is not well distended.  In the presence of
     ascites and absence of intravenous contrast, it is difficult to precisely
     define the bowel wall.  However, there are several extralumenal small gas
     bubbles adjacent to the second portion of the duodenum, consistent with
     microperforation.
     
     There is a moderate amount of ascites, increased since the previous study,
     including increased amount of fluid in the lesser sac. There is also increased
     amount of air in the lesser sac, some of which appears tubular and may be
     located in the pancreatic ductal branches, and some of which is nondependent
     free air. These findings may be related to air leak from duodenal perforation.
     However, the pancreatic head and neck cannot be distinguished from the
     surrounding fluid, and necrotizing pancreatitis with superimposed infection
     cannot be excluded on the current limited noncontrast exam.
     
     There are stones in the gallbladder. There is a stent extending from the right
     hepatic bile duct through the common duct into the duodenum. There is no
     intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The liver parenchyma, spleen, adrenal
     glands, and the left kidney appear unremarkable on limited noncontrast
     evaluation. There is a 2 mm nonobstructing stone in the mid/lower right
     kidney.
     
     PELVIS CT WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There is an increased amount of ascites compared
     to the previous study.  There is a Foley catheter in the bladder.  Small
     bowel, colon, and rectum appear unremarkable on limited evaluation without
                                                                 (Over)

     There are stones in the gallbladder. There is a stent extending from the right
     hepatic bile duct through the common duct into the duodenum. There is no
     intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The liver parenchyma, spleen, adrenal
     glands, and the left kidney appear unremarkable on limited noncontrast
     evaluation. There is a 2 mm nonobstructing stone in the mid/lower right
     kidney.
     
     PELVIS CT WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There is an increased amount of ascites compared
     to the previous study.  There is a Foley catheter in the bladder.  Small
     bowel, colon, and rectum appear unremarkable on limited evaluation without
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     (Cont)
     intravenous contrast.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Degenerative changes are present in the lower lumbar spine and
     sacroiliac joints.
     
     Preliminary report of duodenal microperforation was discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 258**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at 11:45 p.m. on [**3443-4-9**]. Inability to excluded necrotizing
     pancreatitis with superimposed infection was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4459**] at
     8:55 am on [**3443-4-10**].
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Findings suspicious for microperforation in the second portion of the
     duodenum.
     
     2)  Moderate ascites, increased since the previous study, with increased fluid
     and air in the lesser sac.  While these findings may be related to duodenal
     perforation, necrotizing pancreatitis with superimposed infection cannot be
     excluded.
     
     3)  Cholelithiasis.
     4)  Non-obstructing right renal stone.
     4)  Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than
     right.
     
                                                                           DFDkq

     Chest, single AP film.
     
     History of pancreatitis with bacteremia, sepsis, and hypertension.
     
     NG tube is in stomach.  There are low lung volumes.  Allowing for this, heart
     size is borderlined.  There are bibasilar opacities consistent with
     atelectases and possible associated small pleural effusions, essentially
     unchanged since the prior film of April of the same date if allowance is made
     for technical differences.  No pneumothorax, and no evidence for CHF.
