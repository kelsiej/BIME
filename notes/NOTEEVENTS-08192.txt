Admission Date:  [**3166-8-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**3166-8-25**]

Date of Birth:   [**3086-8-28**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Acove

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 80-year-old woman was
recently discharged from the Acove service on [**3166-8-26**] after an admission for respiratory difficulties and a
pancreatitis layer.  The patient has a long history of severe
emphysema, chronic pancreatitis with pancreatic
insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, and mitral valve
replacement.  At the time of discharge, the patient was
breathing at her baseline level, requiring 2 liters of oxygen
at night, but no oxygen requirement during the day.  She was
tolerating a low fat diet after having experienced nausea
with food the whole week prior.  She had been treated with a
fentanyl patch for back and epigastric pain, as well as
Compazine for nausea.  These medications had been
discontinued two days prior to discharge.  A physical therapy
consult had recommended that the patient have a [**Hospital 1058**]
rehabilitation stay to improve her functional status prior to
discharge home, but the patient desired to go home and
declined a rehabilitation facility admission.

One day after being discharged home, the patient's daughter
noted her to be confused.  Per the daughter, the patient was
speaking incoherently and not capable of doing tasks that she
normally could, such as turning on the television with a
remote.  The patient's daughter brought her back to the [**Hospital6 293**] where she was admitted for
evaluation of her confusion.

ALLERGIES:  CODEINE AND PENICILLIN

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Significant for substantial tobacco history
of 60 plus pack years; patient quit five years ago.  Also
significant for former alcohol use.  Patient quit 50 years
ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97.9��, heart rate 82, blood
pressure 153/70, respirations 18, oxygen saturation 98% on
room air.
GENERAL:  The patient was alert in no acute distress and
pleasant.
NECK:  No lymphadenopathy.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Pupils equal, round and
reactive to light, extraocular muscles are intact.
CHEST:  Significant for decreased breath sounds bilaterally,
no wheezes or rales.
HEART:  Irregularly irregular rhythm with a regular rate,
grade 1 out of 6 apical murmur.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel
sounds.
BACK:  No costovertebral angle tenderness.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema.
SKIN:  Good turgor, no rash.
NEUROLOGIC:  Alert and oriented x3, cranial nerves II through
XII intact.  Motor and sensory not formally tested.

ADMISSION LABS:  Sodium 133, potassium 3.5, chloride 95,
total CO2 28, BUN 11, creatinine 0.8, glucose 111, white
blood cell count 14, hematocrit 41, platelets 286.
Urinalysis dip stick negative, INR 1.7.  CT head negative for
hemorrhage.  Electrocardiogram - atrial fibrillation with old
ST depressions in V3 and V4.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Please refer to prior discharge dictation
for hospital course prior to this admission.  The patient was
admitted to the floor for further work up of her confusion at
home.  Throughout her hospital stay, the patient was
oriented, with good attention and clear thought process.  Her
confusion at home was attributed to delirium, possibly
secondary to medications she had received in the hospital
prior to discharge, including Compazine and fentanyl.

A geriatrics consult was obtained.  Their impression is that
the patient has evidence of mild cortical dementia and would
benefit from further work up as an outpatient.  The patient's
labs during admission included a vitamin B12 level of 1533, a
folate level of 14.2 and a TSH level of 3.6.

The patient was switched from digoxin to diltiazem for rate
control of her atrial fibrillation.  Her Coumadin was
increased to 7 mg po qd until a therapeutic INR of 2.4 was
obtained.  She was otherwise maintained on her current
cardiac and pulmonary medications.

The patient complained of mild nausea which was improved
after the patient was placed on a no fat diet.  She also
complained of mild lower back and hip pain which she
attributed to feeling tense.  The patient developed a
blanchable erythematous rash on her back, possibly secondary
to a hypersensitivity reaction to the sheets on her bed.  She
was started on Sarna lotion for pruritus.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post delirium

     CLINICAL INDICATION:  79 year old woman with history of chronic pancreatitis.
     Now with recurrent right upper quadrant pain.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically-acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung bases through the pubic symphysis prior to and following the
     administration of 150 cc of Optiray contrast IV.  Optiray contrast was
     administered in light of debility.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Comparison is made with the patient's next-prior study dated
     [**3166-8-19**].
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There are small bilateral
     pleural effusions, new since the prior study.  There is subsegmental
     atelectasis at the lung bases.  No pulmonary nodules are identified.  The
     patient is status post cholecystectomy and there is stable pneumobilia.  The
     overall appearance of the liver is unchanged since the prior exam.  Multiple
     surgical clips are present in the region of the GE junction.  There is a trace
     amount of fluid anterior to the left lobe of the liver, stable since the prior
     study.  The adrenal glands and spleen are unremarkable.  The pancreas is
     atrophic.  There is no evidence of inflammatory stranding about the pancreas
     to suggest acute pancreatitis and no pseudocysts are identified.  The right
     kidney contains several small cysts, as before.  New since the prior study is
     a wedge-shaped region of decreased attenuation at the mid pole of the right
     kidney with associated stranding in the pararenal fat.  There is no
     hydronephrosis nor evidence of renal masses.  The left kidney is unremarkable.
      The ureters and normal in caliber throughout their course to the urinary
     bladder.  Oral contrast has passed freely through the bowel to the level of
     the transverse colon.  The visualized loops of large and small bowel in the
     abdomen are within normal limits.  There is no free air identified in the
     abdomen and no abnormally enlarged lymph nodes are seen in the mesentery or
     retroperitoneum.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The urinary bladder is distended.  The
     uterus is atrophic but otherwise unremarkable.  The rectum and sigmoid colon
     are also normal and no free fluid is seen in the deep pelvis.
     
     There are degenerative changes of the osseous structures and the patient is
                                                                 (Over)

     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Interval development of a wedge-shaped perfusion defect at the mid pole of
     the right kidney.  Along with pararenal fat stranding, the overall appearance
     is most suggestive of pyelonephritis.  Less likely, especially given the
     patient's elevated INR, would be a focal infarction.  If clinically indicated,
     a follow-up CT scan could be obtained in ten days to two weeks time.
     
     2) Stable pneumobilia.
     
     3) Small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis, new since the
     prior exam.

     Now with recurrent right upper quadrant pain.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically-acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung bases through the pubic symphysis prior to and following the
     administration of 150 cc of Optiray contrast IV.  Optiray contrast was
     administered in light of debility.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Comparison is made with the patient's next-prior study dated
     [**3166-8-19**].
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There are small bilateral
     pleural effusions, new since the prior study.  There is subsegmental
     atelectasis at the lung bases.  No pulmonary nodules are identified.  The
     patient is status post cholecystectomy and there is stable pneumobilia.  The
     overall appearance of the liver is unchanged since the prior exam.  Multiple
     surgical clips are present in the region of the GE junction.  There is a trace
     amount of fluid anterior to the left lobe of the liver, stable since the prior
     study.  The adrenal glands and spleen are unremarkable.  The pancreas is
     atrophic.  There is no evidence of inflammatory stranding about the pancreas
     to suggest acute pancreatitis and no pseudocysts are identified.  The right
     kidney contains several small cysts, as before.  New since the prior study is
     a wedge-shaped region of decreased attenuation at the mid pole of the right
     kidney with associated stranding in the pararenal fat.  There is no
     hydronephrosis nor evidence of renal masses.  The left kidney is unremarkable.
      The ureters and normal in caliber throughout their course to the urinary
     bladder.  Oral contrast has passed freely through the bowel to the level of
     the transverse colon.  The visualized loops of large and small bowel in the
     abdomen are within normal limits.  There is no free air identified in the
     abdomen and no abnormally enlarged lymph nodes are seen in the mesentery or
     retroperitoneum.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The urinary bladder is distended.  The
     uterus is atrophic but otherwise unremarkable.  The rectum and sigmoid colon
     are also normal and no free fluid is seen in the deep pelvis.
     
     There are degenerative changes of the osseous structures and the patient is
                                                                 (Over)

     status post placement of a right hip prosthesis.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Interval development of a wedge-shaped perfusion defect at the mid pole of
     the right kidney.  Along with pararenal fat stranding, the overall appearance
     is most suggestive of pyelonephritis.  Less likely, especially given the
     patient's elevated INR, would be a focal infarction.  If clinically indicated,
     a follow-up CT scan could be obtained in ten days to two weeks time.
     
     2) Stable pneumobilia.
     
     3) Small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis, new since the
     prior exam.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      f/u of RUL nodule
     No contraindications for IV contrast

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Right upper lobe lung nodule seen on CT of [**3166-8-18**]. Former smoker
     please follow up.
     
     COMPARISON STUDY: [**3166-8-19**].
     
     TECHNIQUE: Contiguous helical imaging was obtained from the thoracic inlet to
     the upper abdomen after IV contrast administration.
     
     CT SCAN OF THE CHEST W/CONTRAST: There is no significant axillary, mediastinal
     or hilar lymphadenopathy. The heart is enlarged. Coronary artery calcification
     is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Small bilateral pleural effusions
     are seen. The lung windows demonstrate scattered foci of atelectasis. There is
     also some smooth prominence of the interlobar septa and scattered foci which
     could be related to resolving pulmonary edema and atelectasis. The previously
     identified triangular pulmonary nodule in the inferior aspect of the right
     upper lobe is again seen. It measures approximately 7 mm and is not
     significantly changed since the previous exam. No new pulmonary nodules are
     detected.
     
     Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, again pneumobilia is
     identified. Focal decreased perfusion within the right kidney is also again
     seen of uncertain etiology but could represent an area of focal
     pyelonephritis. This was identified on the previous CT scan. Multiple
     bilateral renal cysts are seen. The remainder of the imaged portion of the
     upper abdomen is normal. Skeletal structures demonstrate no suspicious lytic
     or sclerotic foci. Incidentally noted is a Schmorl's node.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Stable triangular shaped 7 mm pulmonary nodule in the inferior aspect of
     the right upper lobe. 3 month follow up may be performed to ensure 6 month
     stability.
     
     2) Small bilateral pleural effusions with some scattered foci of associated
     atelectasis and interlobular septal thickening which could be related to some
     mild failure.
     
     3) Stable pneumobilia.
     
     4) Again seen is a focal perfusion defect within the mid pole of the right
                                                                 (Over)
