     CONTRAST: 100 cc of Optiray was administered intravenously for patient's
     general debilitation.
     
     CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  Soft tissue windows reveal small mediastinal and
     borderline right hilar lymph nodes, presumably reactive in nature.  A small
     right pleural effusion is noted.  There is a trace pericardial effusion and
     pericardial thickening.  The heart size is normal.  There is no left pleural
     effusion.
     
     Lung windows reveal diffuse emphysema.  Air space opacification with air
     bronchograms is demonstrated in the right lower lobe.  Part of the
     opacification in the right lower lobe has a somewhat honeycombing appearance,
     probably due to the combined appearance of air space consolidation and
     background emphysema.  There is no evidence of cavitary lesions or multiple
     nodular opacities indicative of septic emboli.  Small areas of patchy
     opacities are demonstrated in the right middle lobe anteriorly which appears
     to be associated with minor fissure and may represent atelectasis or scarring.
      Less likely, this could also represent patchy areas of infection.
     
     Bone windows reveal degenerative changes.
     
     In the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, a few high density foci is noted
     in the gallbladder, which may represent small gallstones.  Otherwise no
     significant abnormalities are seen.

Admission Date:  [**3133-2-2**]       Discharge Date:  [**3133-2-17**]

Date of Birth:   [**3061-9-21**]       Sex:  M

Service:  MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71-year-old male who
had transferred from [**Hospital3 976**] with prolonged
pneumonia.  The patient was originally admitted to [**Hospital3 975**] on [**3133-1-8**] for community acquired pneumonia after
patient developed new onset pleuritic chest pain and
shortness of breath while shoveling snow on [**Holiday 3516**].  He
was found to have [**5-12**] blood cultures identified as staph
hominis.  A TE was performed and preliminarily identified a
vegetation on the RV outflow tract.

He was transferred to [**Hospital1 75**] on
[**3133-1-12**].  Events from his previous admission here including
CTA which showed right lower lobe pneumonia and emphysema,
but no evidence of PE.  The TE was reread by Cardiology here
who felt that the vegetation was actually an artifact.  A
repeat TTE here confirmed no vegetations and an ejection
fraction of greater than 55%.  He was found to have one out
of six blood cultures positive for coag negative staph.  He
was also found to have urinary retention and has been with a
Foley catheter since.

He was discharged to [**Hospital6 **] on [**3133-1-18**] on a 21
day course of Vancomycin and Levaquin.  The patient's
pulmonary functions subjectively improved until [**3133-1-26**] when
he became short of breath and had spiking fevers to 103.0 F.
He was readmitted to [**Hospital3 976**] on [**3133-1-28**].  His
hospital course there was significant for new right middle
and left lower lobe pneumonia in addition to previous right
lower lobe.  His Levaquin was stopped and he was started on
Tobramycin and Vancomycin.  He was given Solu-Medrol times
one dose for wheezing.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 74**] for further evaluation.

On admission, the patient denies any cough or sputum
production.  He states that he has shortness of breath only
when off oxygen and it is exacerbated when walking.  He
denies, but has had night sweats and shaking chills.  Over
the last month, he has never had blood sputum and has gained
weight.  No calf pain.  No diarrhea, nausea or vomiting.  No
new rash, focal numbness or weakness.  No recent sick
contacts or recent travel.  No history of blood transfusions.
No history of TB.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Osteoporosis, hereditary diagnosis by bone scan in [**3120**].
2.  Inguinal hernia repair on the right in [**3122**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature 96.0 F, blood
pressure 148/65, heart rate 113, respiratory rate 30, O2 sat
93% on four liters plus 40% facemask.  In general the patient
had no labored breathing, although appears to be breathing
comfortably.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Oropharynx
with thrush.  Mucous membranes dry.  Jugular venous pressure
not elevated.  Neck supple.  Anicteric sclerae.  Pupils
equal, round and reactive to light.  Chest:  Decreased breath
sounds bilaterally at the bases, right more than left.
Egophony on the right lower lobe.  Decreased tactile fremitus
on the right.  Bronchial breath sounds in right.  Dullness to
percussion right more than left.  Occasional expiratory
wheezes.  Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no
murmur, gallop or rub appreciated.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds, no
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities:  Left PICC in place, clean,
dry and intact.  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  There is 2+
DP and PTs bilaterally.  Neuro:  Alert and oriented times
three, no gross motor or sensory defects.

LABORATORY DATA:  Most recent include white count of 8.7,
hemoglobin 11.2, hematocrit 32.6.  The patient did have a
white count of 17.7, however had subsequently decreased.
Platelets 438.  [**2-4**] urinalysis negative.  Bum 15,
creatinine 0.6, sodium 136, potassium 4.6, chloride 97,
bicarbonate 30, ALT 46, AST 33, alkaline phosphatase 109, t
bilirubin 0.3.  Patient also ruled out with CKs of 23, 23 and
21.  Troponin less than 0.3, less than 0.3 and less than 0.3.
The patient's peak liver enzymes were ALT of 110, AST 81, LD
287, alkaline phosphatase 202 that was on admission.  The
enzymes have subsequently decreased.

The patient's hepatitis B antigen and antibody negative,
hepatitis C negative, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] negative, RS
negative, HIV negative.

VAT biopsy, the tissue had no microorganisms on gram stain
and was no growth for aerobic, anaerobic, acid-fast or fungal
cultures.  Legionella also negative.

Sputum contaminated.  Urine culture with no growth.  Blood
cultures on [**2-3**] with no growth.  Fungal cultures on [**2-2**]
with no growth.  Pleural fluid gram stain no microorganisms.
Fluid culture no growth.  Anaerobic culture no growth.
Acid-fast, none seen.

Last chest x-ray on [**2-15**] shows slight increase in right
lower lobe lung opacity.  This may be due to a pneumonia or
atelectasis and small right pleural effusion.

A pathology of the VAT biopsy on [**2-10**] revealed pleural
biopsy adhesions, chronic inflammation and mesothelial
hyperplasia, no evidence of malignancy.

Right lower lobe wedge biopsy with patchy organizing
pneumonitis with focal prominent scarring, focal interstitial
fibrosis and focal interstitial chronic inflammation.

Pleural fluid taken on [**3133-2-7**], cytology negative for
malignant cells.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  PULMONARY:  The patient was initially admitted to the
MICU for observation.  The patient was never intubated in the
MICU.  The patient, however had thoracentesis which revealed
the transudate and negative cytology for malignancy.  A high
resolution CT Scan showed emphysema and evidence of
congestive heart failure and right lower lobe consolidation.
Rheumatological work up was negative.

The patient had been diuresed with Lasix p.r.n.  The patient
in the MICU was started on only Ceftazidime.  Other
antibiotics were discontinued.  The patient did not complain
of dyspnea, cough or chest pain.  On [**3133-2-9**], the patient
was taken for a VAT per CT Surgery with results as stated
above.  Pulmonary consulted continued to follow and felt that
the patient had no need for steroids.

A right chest tube was placed on the day of the VAT.  There
was never a pneumothorax and the chest tube was pulled per CT
Surgery on [**3133-2-13**].  The patient did develop some chest pain
a day or two following the surgery and described it as a band
around his chest.  For thoroughness, the patient was ruled
out for a MI.  The chest pain resolved on its on.

From a pulmonary standpoint, the patient continued to improve
throughout the hospitalization.  He was given nebulizer
treatments, Flovent MDI, chest PT, incentive spirometry and
eventually began ambulating.  The patient's O2 requirement on
discharge was four liters nasal cannula.  The patient
Ceftazidime was discontinued on [**3133-2-16**].  The patient will
need follow up with Pulmonology as an outpatient.

2.  URINARY RETENTION:  The patient had a Foley for the
entire MICU stay and once transferred to the floor, the
patient was given a trial without the Foley.  The patient did
not urinate without the Foley and had to be straight cathed.
The Foley was replaced.  A second trial was given on
[**3133-2-15**].  The patient, again, failed the trial without the
Foley and the Foley was replaced.

Urology was consulted.  Urology stated that the patient
should remain with the Foley in him for the next two weeks
and then follow up in Urology Clinic as an outpatient.  The
patient was also started on empiric Flomax for benign
prostatic hypertrophy.

3.  ELEVATED LIVER FUNCTION TESTS:  The patient was noted to
have elevated LFTs on admission, however they subsequently
decreased to normal.  Unclear etiology as to why the LFTs
were elevated.

4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient's blood, sputum, pleural
fluid and tissue biopsy were all no growth.  The patient had
a 12 day course of IV Ceftazidime while here in the hospital.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient was discharged in good
condition on [**3133-2-17**] to [**Hospital6 **].  The patient is
to follow up with his PCP.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Flomax 0.4 mg q.h.s.
2.  Protonix 40 mg q. AM.
3.  Albuterol nebs q. six hours p.r.n.
4.  Atrovent nebs q. six hours p.r.n.
5.  TUMs 500 mg t.i.d.
6.  Vitamin D 400 IU q.d.
7.  Miconazole powder 2% one application topically t.i.d.
p.r.n.
8.  Colace 100 mg b.i.d.
9.  Flovent MDI 110 mcg two puffs b.i.d.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient was instructed to follow up in the
Urology Clinic at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2315**] in two weeks.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Right sided pneumonia. Evaluate for IPF.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helical and thin section HRCT images of the chest were obtained
     without contrast.
     
     COMPARISONS: [**3133-1-16**]
     
     CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST:  There has been interval development of small bilateral
     pleural effusions. Several subcentimeter mediastinal lymph nodes are seen,
     likely reactive in nature.  There is a small amount of pericardial fluid as
     well. There is evidence of coronary artery calcifications. The overall heart
     size is within normal limits.
     
     Again seen is moderate, diffuse centrilobular emphysema, most prominent at the
     lung apices. There is continued evidence of right lower lobe consolidation,
     but slightly improved since the previous exam consistent with patient's
     history of pneumonia. Since the prior study there is now evidence of
     intralobular septal thickening consistent with pulmonary edema. There is no
     evidence of honeycombing to suggest interstitial lung disease.
     
     In the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, the unehanced liver, spleen,
     adrenal glands and upper poles of the kidneys are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Slight improvement in right lower lobe pneumonia.
     2) Pulmonary edema superimposed on background emphysema. Small pericardial
     effusion and small bilateral pleural effusions.
     3) No evidence of honeycombing to suggest interstitial lung disease.

     Compared to 2 days earlier.
     
     INDICATION: Increasing oxygen requirement in patient with history of pneumonia
     and congestive heart failure.
     
     A left PICC line has an unusual course, projecting over the head of the left
     clavicle and coursing to the midline; the PICC line subsequently courses
     superiorly in the left paraspinal region. This is not the expected course of
     the left subclavian or brachiocephalic vein or the jugular vein. Correlation
     with recent CT of several days earlier shows that the catheter is apparently
     extravascular and courses anterior to the left subclavian and brachiocephalic
     vein and subsequently courses into the presternal soft tissues and then into
     the soft tissues of the neck.
     
     The heart size and mediastinal contours are stable in appearance. There
     remains some slight volume loss on the right with rightward shift of the
     mediastinum. There is improving opacity within the right lower lobe. There are
     minor atelectatic changes of the left lung base. There remains small bilateral
     pleural effusions.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) Malpositioned left PICC line, which appears to be extravascular
     in location as discussed with the clinical service caring for the patient.
     
     2) Improving right lower lobe pneumonia.
     
     3) Small bilateral pleural effusions.
     
     4) Emphysema.

     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Pneumothorax.
     
     Two chest tubes remain in place in the right hemithorax.  No pneumothorax is
     identified.  There is persistent mild volume loss in the right hemithorax with
     slight rightward shift of the mediastinal structures.  There has been interval
     improved aeration at the left lung base.  There remains increased opacity in
     the right lower lobe predominantly in the retrocardiac region as well as some
     increased patchy opacity in the right mid lung zone.  There are probable small
     bilateral pleural effusions.
     
     Attenuation of pulmonary vasculature in the upper lobes is consistent with the

     INDICATION: Recurrent pneumonia not improving on antibiotics.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Multiple axial images of the chest were obtained without
     intravenous contrast.
     
     COMPARISON: CT of the chest [**3133-2-3**].
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Small bilateral pleural
     effusions are decreased in size from the prior study. No loculated collection
     is identified. There is also a small pericardial effusion. Several sub cm
     mediastinal lymph nodes are unchanged from the prior study. The coronary
     arteries are calcified, as is the thoracic aorta. The heart size is unchanged
     and within normal limits.
     
     Moderate diffuse centrilobular emphysema is again noted, most severe at the
     lung apices. Consolidation of the right lower lobe has improved, with some
     residual consolidation and air bronchograms present. In the lingula, basal
     right middle lobe and bilateral lower lobes are areas of ground glass opacity,
     significantly more extensive and confluent in comparison to the prior study.
     The superior portions of the liver, spleen, adrenal glands and upper poles of

     segmental bronchi bilaterally.
     
     Bone windows are without evidence of destructive osseous lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION: Improving right lower lobe consolidation on a background of
     moderate emphysema. Small bilateral pleural effusions have decreased in size
     and are without evidence of loculation. A diffuse pattern of ground glass
     opacity within the lower lobes, right middle lobe and lingula is present and
     may reflect drug toxicity, hypersensitivity or atypical pneumonia.

     CT THORAX, [**3133-6-5**] compared to [**3133-2-26**]:
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Probable BOOP.  Evaluate response of lung abnormalities
     to interval steroid therapy.
     
     Helical CT of the chest was performed without IV or oral contrast
     administration.  Images were acquired at 5 mm collimation and reconstructed at
     5 mm intervals throughout the thorax.
     
     Assessment of the lungs reveals diffuse severe emphysema.  This is most marked
     in the upper lobes.  Since the previous study, there has been marked interval
     improvement in diffuse pulmonary opacities.  Areas of previously present
     consolidation have resolved with residual areas of ground-glass attenuation in
     most of these regions.  Previously present areas of ground-glass attenuation
     have either resolved or are improved.  The residual remaining opacities are
     most pronounced within the lower lobes, right greater than left.  Lesser
     degree of involvement is seen within the right middle and right upper lobes.
     No new or worsening areas of opacification are identified.  The central
     airways appear patent with no obstructing central endobronchial lesions
     observed.
     
     The skeletal structures of the thorax demonstrate degenerative changes within
     the spine.
     
     The soft tissue structures of the thorax demonstrate no significantly enlarged
     noncalcified mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes.  Calcified lymph nodes are seen
     at the AP window regions.  The heart size is normal.  Coronary artery
     calcifications are observed.  No significant pleural effusions are evident.  A
     small amount of pericardial fluid is seen and appears decreased in the
     interval.
     
     Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, the adrenal glands are normal
     in appearance.  Vascular calcifications are noted in the abdominal aorta
     extending into the proximal right renal artery.  Calcified stones are seen
     dependently within the gallbladder.  Note is made of hyperdensities of the
     liver compared to the spleen on this unenhanced exam.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Marked interval improvement in previously noted diffuse lung opacities.
     Areas of previously present consolidation have decreased, with residual areas
     of ground-glass attenuation, and previously present areas of ground-glass

     attenuation have either resolved or are significantly decreased in extent. The
     observed findings may be due to response of BOOP to interval therapy.
     
     2)  Extensive emphysema.
     
     3)  Calcified gallstones within the gallbladder.
     
     4)  Hyperdensity of the liver on this unenhanced study.  Is the patient
     receiving Amiodarone therapy? Amiodarone lung toxicity can present as BOOP.

     CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST; CT RECONSTRUCTION                        Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 7145**]
     Reason: assess interval change in pulm infiltrates/BOOP
     Field of view: 36
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      72 year old man with BOOP, now completed Rx with prednisone, clinically
      improved.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      assess interval change in pulm infiltrates/BOOP
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  BOOP, status post steroid therapy.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3133-6-5**] and [**3133-2-26**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the chest were obtained with inspiration and
     expiration in supine and prone positions.  Sagittal and coronal reconstruction
     images were also obtained.
     
     CHEST HRCT WITHOUT CONTRAST:  Soft tissue windows show nonenlarged axillary
     and mediastinal lymph nodes.  The heart has a normal size and shows coronary
     calcifications.  Intrathoracic aorta has a normal caliber and shows mural
     calcifications.  There are no pericardial or pleural effusions.
     
     Lung windows show multifocal new areas of subpleural consolidation involving
     primarily the upper lobes but also the left base.  Areas of ground glass
     opacity, subpleural lines, traction bronchiectasis and septal thickening are
     also seen in the upper lung zones.  In addition, there is diffuse emphysema.
     Air-trapping is seen on expiratory images.  The airways appear patent to the
     level of the segmental bronchi bilaterally.
     
     The visualized upper abdomen shows gallstones in the gallbladder and renal
     vascular calcifications.  The imaged regions of the liver, pancreas, spleen,
     stomach, small and large bowel, kidneys and adrenals are unremarkable.  The
     osseous structures show degenerative change of the spine and an old
     compression deformity of a lower thoracic vertebra.
     
     IMPRESSION:   1. Interval development of new foci of subpleural consolidation
     and interstitial abnormalities, with an upper zone predominance. Findings are
     consistent with history of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.
     
     2. Diffuse emphysema.
     
     3. Gallstones with no cholecystitis.
