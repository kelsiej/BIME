History of Present Illness:
(History based on accounts of patient's daughter, 
daughter-in-law, home caregiver, EMS and OSH records)
Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] is an 85 year old woman with a history of atrial 
fibrillation (not on coumadin), hypertension, DVT's, and colon 
CA 7 years ago, who was found unresponsive lying on her right 
side on the day of presentation by a neighbor.  She lives alone 
and has a neighbor who is her nurse-caregiver several mornings a 
week.  Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] was last seen normal about 12 hours before 
she was found.  Her daughter-in-law reportedly called her the 
evening prior and there was no answer, and called her again in 
the morning, became concerned, and notified her neighbor, who 
called EMS.  Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] was found lying on her right side next 
to her recliner with her right arm and leg entangled in the 
chair.  She had some edema overlying her right scalp and her 
right arm and leg were also edematous.  She was not responsive, 
not talking or following commands, and not moving her right side 
as well as the left.  She was brought to the [**Hospital 2164**] Hospital 
ED, where she arrived at 1:17 p.m.  There her initial blood 
pressure was recorded as 67/45, HR 130, RR 24, T 100.8 axillary. 
 Blood glucose was 317.  Due to her somnolence she was 
intubated, for which she received lidocaine, rocuronium, 
etomidate, succinylcholine, ativan 4 mg and fentanyl 100 mcg at 
about 2 p.m.  She was also given NS IV with improvement in her 
blood pressure. On exam there prior to intubation she was noted 
to have left gaze deviation and ""withdrawal with all four 
extremities.""  Labs were significant for a wbc of 18.5, INR of 
1.32, and UA with 37 wbc. CK was elevated at 863, MB fraction 
was pending. She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 83**]. 

Upon arrival at 5 p.m. she was afebrile, with BP 220/110, HR 
109, RR 20.  She had received no sedation since 2 p.m., but was 
not responsive to voice, and did not move her right side as well 
as the left. Neurosurgery was consulted and she received 1 gram 
Dilantin, 50g Mannitol, 10 mg Decadron, and ultimately required 
a labetalol drip to control her blood pressures.  She had a 
CT/CTA of the head which revealed acute subarachnoid and 
intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left frontal, parietal, and 
temporal lobes.  There was evidence of edema with sulcal 
effacement on the left and 2 mm of midline shift.  CTA was not 
suspicious for a mass lesion.  She received propofol 10 mg at 6 
p.m. for the CT but has had no sedating medications since then, 
without any improvement in her mental status.  When it was 
determined that Neurosurgery would not be admitting her, the 
Neurology service was consulted, 3 hours after the patient's 
arrival to the ED.

Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] has not been feeling well for several weeks, 
sometimes not getting out of bed in the morning.  Her family are 
not aware of any specific recent illnesses, although her 
daughter thinks she may have had a mild heart attack two weeks 
ago.  Her daughter reports that she has been falling a lot 
lately, and hitting her head.  It sounds like she loses 
consciousness with the falls, as she once said she woke up after 
falling down the stairs and didn't recall that she had fallen.

Review of systems:  Not definitively known per nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7610**]r.
 
Past Medical History:
Receives her primary care through [**Hospital3 294**], Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] 
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
- Hypertension, not taking her HCTZ recently due to side 
effects, baseline blood pressure 160-180
- Diabetes
- Atrial fibrillation, not on coumadin 
- DVT's in both legs - per daughter was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 **] in 
past, was on heparin but they had to stop it (she doesn't know 
why)
- Colon cancer 7 years ago, s/p surgical resection; has not had 
follow-up colonoscopies
- Does not go for mammograms
- Cataracts
- Daughter says she was told she could never have any surgery 
because of a pinched nerve or blood vessel in her head
 
Social History:
Lives alone, daughter-in-law and daughter closely involved.  
Neighbors include a nurse who is her caregiver, and her partner 
who is Ms. [**Known patient lastname 11631**] lawyer.  No
history of tobacco, alcohol, drug use.

paratonia with  rigidity in left arm.  Rarely spontaneously 
moves left arm but not purposefully.  Able to wiggle fingers 
with left arm, withdraws to noxious stimuli.  No movement of 
right arm, grimaces but does not move with noxious.  Weakly 
withdraws both legs to noxious, left a bit more vigorously than 
right. No spontaneous movement of legs.

###IMAGING###
EKG: Afib, Twave flattening, NSST changes

CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECO [**3039-12-20**]:
FINDINGS:  There is a large hypodense area in the territory of 
the left MCA involving the temporal as well as frontoparietal 
regions.  There is associated intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  The 
findings are most consistent with hemorrhagic conversion of an 
infarct.  There is no herniation present. 
The CTA demonstrates that the left vertebral artery is dominant. 
 The internal carotid arteries appear normal.  Their origins are 
not visualized.  There are areas of atherosclerosis within the 
cavernous portions of both internal carotid arteries.  The 
basilar artery is small.  There is a fetal origin to both 
posterior cerebral arteries.  There is a suggestion of an area 
of stenosis in the P2 segment of the right posterior cerebral 
artery.  Both posterior inferior cerebellar arteries are 
present. 
Both middle and anterior cerebral arteries appear normal.  There 
are no 
aneurysms. 
The volume rendered images of the circle of [**Location (un) 345**] demonstrate 
inferior 
displacement of the distal and middle cerebral artery branches 
on the left due to the mass effect from the intraparenchymal 
hemorrhage infarct.
No filling defects are noted. 
IMPRESSION:  Hypodensity in the territory of the left middle 
cerebral artery with areas of intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  The 
CTA does not demonstrate any evidence of an aneurysm or filling 
defects. 

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST [**3039-12-20**]:
FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of acute fracture.  Evaluation 
of the 
prevertebral soft tissues is limited by endotracheal tube.  
There is 
exaggerated lordosis of the cervical spine with relative 
widening of the 
anterior disc spaces seen at C3-4 and C4-5 levels.  CT does not 
provide 
intrathecal detail comparable to MRI, however, the thecal sac 
appears grossly intact.  Degenerative changes noted within the 
cervical spine. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  No evidence of acute fracture.  Exaggerated cervical 
lordosis with 
relative widening of the anterior disc spaces at the C3-4 and 
C4-5 levels. 
Ligamentous injury cannot be excluded and if clinically 
indicated, MR could be helpful for further evaluation. 
2.  Degenerative changes noted within the cervical spine. 
  

EEG [**3039-12-21**]: This is an abnormal EEG due to the suppressed 
background 
and intermittent low voltage frontal alpha activity. The 
anteriorly 
predominant intermittent alpha activity may represent an alpha 
coma, 
although this is usually more persistent. The low voltage 
suppressed 
background suggests a severe encephalopathy, which may be seen 
with 
infections, toxic metabolic abnormalities, medication effect or 
ischemia. No epileptiform features were noted. A repeat study 
would be 
beneficial to better assess the posterior background rhythm and 
to 
assess for interval change. 

CT T-spine: No fracture or malignment within the thoracic spine.
CT L-spine: 1.  No fracture or malalignment within the lumbar 
spine. 
2.  1.5 cm nonobstructing left proximal ureteral stone. 3.  
Atherosclerosis. 

Head CT [**12-21**]: 1.  No significant mass effect or evidence of 
herniation. 
2.  Stable or slight interval increase in left frontoparietal 
temporal acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage with acute adjacent 
subarachnoid blood. 
3.  Slight interval worsening in surrounding edema.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] [**3039-12-21**]: There is no abnormal bone marrow edema.  
There is no disc edema.  There is minimal prevertebral soft 
tissue edema along the entire cervical spine.  This could be due 
to ligamentous sprain.  In addition, mild edema is also noted 
within interspinous ligament posteriorly to C3-4 and 5.  Again, 
this could indicate ligamentous strain.  The craniocervical 
junction is normal.  The cervical spine alignment is also 
preserved.   
At C4-5, there is a tiny central disc protrusion indenting the 
ventral thecal sac causing no significant spinal canal 
narrowing. 
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of disc or bone marrow edema.  
Prevertebral interspinous ligament edema could indicate 
ligamentous strain.  No abnormal signal within the cord or 
spinal canal stenosis. 

MR brain with contrast [**3039-12-21**]: FINDINGS:  The MRV does not 
demonstrate any evidence of venous sinus thrombosis. 
There is a large area of slow diffusion associated with the 
large left 
frontoparietal hematoma.  These findings are most consistent 
with hemorrhagic infarct.  An additional acute infarct is noted 
within the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery territory.  
There is no associated hemorrhage within this infarct. 
There are moderate amounts of confluent periventricular white 
matter T2 
hyperintensity consistent with moderate amounts of chronic 
microvascular 
ischemic change.  No enhancing masses are identified.  Areas of 
increased 
signal on the post-gadolinium images were present on the 
pre-gadolinium axial T1 imaging. 
There is no midline shift or herniation.  There is fluid within 
the paranasal sinuses as well as both mastoid air sinuses due to 
intubation. 
IMPRESSION:  Hemorrhagic left middle cerebral artery territory 
infarct. 
Additional acute infarct within the posterior inferior cerebral 
artery 
territory on the left. 

LENIs bilateral [**3039-12-23**]: No evidence of any DVT in either lower 
extremity

CXR [**12-30**]: Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are in standard 
positions.  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, and there is 
new slight engorgement of the pulmonary vascularity accompanied 
by perihilar haziness.  Moderate left and small right pleural 
effusions have developed.  Left retrocardiac opacity may reflect 
a combination of atelectasis and effusion, but underlying 
infectious process is not excluded in the appropriate setting. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
85 year old woman with history of afib not on coumadin, 
hypertension, dvt's, colon cancer, multiple recent falls with 
possible LOC, now found unresponsive with left intraparenchymal 
and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Exam revealed right sided weakness, 
left gaze preference and decreased blink to threat from the 
right.  Possible etiology for bleed included hypertension, 
amyloid angiopathy, contusion/fall, underlying mass or 
hemorrhagic emoblic infarct.  Also, given the history of recent 
falls, question was raised of possible seizure activity.

Hospital course is listed below by system. Notably, on [**1-7**], by 
the family's decision, the goals of care were changed to comfort 
measures only. All antibiotics and antihypertensives were 
discontinued, all IVs removed, and no further labs or vital 
signs were taken. Her cervical collar was removed but kept at 
bedside to replace for any movements that might cause neck pain 
without a collar in place. She was started on sublingual ativan 
and morphine as needed, scopolamine and levsin for secretions, 
and a suppository for constipation as needed. 

Hospital course:

Neuro:  Left intracranial hemorrhage was most likely secondary 
to hemorrhagic conversion of emoblic stroke.  Patient was 
evaluated by neurosurgery, and received mannitol, decadron and 
dilnantin.  Head CTA was negative for aneurysm or vascular 
malformation.  An MRI brain showed again left MCA hemorrhagic 
infarct and an additional acute infarct with in the left PICA 
territory further supporting the etiology of emoblic phenomenon. 
 EEG initally showed slowing with alpha bursts concerning for 
alpha coma but no epileptiform activity; repeat showed findings 
consistent with encephalopathy, still no epileptiform activity.  
CT spine was negative for fracture and MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] showed 
prevertebral interspinous ligament edema that could indicate 
ligamentous strain.  As a result, she was placed in a hard 
collar.  

CV: Acute myocardial infarction was ruled out.  HbAIC and 
fasting lipid panel were sent, and aspirin held.  Her heart rate 
and BP were controlled with a beta blocker and PRN hydralazine.

Pulm: Patient was extubated without difficulty.

ID: She had leukocytosis and gram stain of sputum positive for 
coag positive staph aureus and E. coli.  She was started on 
empiric antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime).

     INDICATION:  85-year-old woman transferred from outside hospital for an
     intracranial hemorrhage.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  A non-contrast head CT was first performed.  Then a CTA of the
     head was performed.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is a large hypodense area in the territory of the left MCA
     involving the temporal as well as frontoparietal regions.  There is associated
     intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  The findings are most consistent with
     hemorrhagic conversion of an infarct.  There is no herniation present.
     
     The CTA demonstrates that the left vertebral artery is dominant.  The internal
     carotid arteries appear normal.  Their origins are not visualized.  There are
     areas of atherosclerosis within the cavernous portions of both internal
     carotid arteries.  The basilar artery is small.  There is a fetal origin to
     both posterior cerebral arteries.  There is a suggestion of an area of
     stenosis in the P2 segment of the right posterior cerebral artery.  Both
     posterior inferior cerebellar arteries are present.

     INDICATION:  85-year-old female status post fall.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT imaging of the lumbar spine was performed without intravenous
     contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of acute fracture or malalignment within the
     lumbar spine.  The vertebral body, and intervertebral disc space heights are
     preserved.  Mild degenerative changes throughout the lumbar spine as follows:
     At L2/3, right facet  sclerosis and small osteophytes slightly indent the
     thecal sac.  At L3/4, right-sided facet sclerosis and small osteophytes
     encroach upon but do not indent the thecal sac.  Facet sclerosis and posterior
     osteophytes are seen at multiple levels, including L3 through S1, right
     slightly greater than left.
     
     CT is not as sensitive as MR define any intrathecal detail.  The visualized
     outline of the thecal sac is unremarkable.
     
     A large 1.5 cm nonobstructing stone is seen within the proximal left ureter.
     Since atherosclerosis lines the abdominal aorta.  A low-density lesion within
     partially imaged within the right liver lobe measures fluid density,
     consistent with a simple cyst.
     
     Contrast within the expiratory phase of excretions is likely related to prior
     injection.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  No fracture or malalignment within the lumbar spine.
     
     2.  1.5 cm nonobstructing left proximal ureteral stone.
     
     3.  Atherosclerosis.

     with prior disc abnormality of CT at C4-5 and C3-4.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted sequences were obtained through
     the cervical spine.
     
     There is no abnormal bone marrow edema.  There is no disc edema.  There is
     minimal prevertebral soft tissue edema along the entire cervical spine.  This
     could be due to ligamentous sprain.  In addition, mild edema is also noted
     within interspinous ligament posteriorly to C3-4 and 5.  Again, this could
     indicate ligamentous strain.  The craniocervical junction is normal.  The
     cervical spine alignment is also preserved.
     
     At C4-5, there is a tiny central disc protrusion indenting the ventral thecal
     sac causing no significant spinal canal narrowing.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of disc or bone marrow edema.
     
     Prevertebral interspinous ligament edema could indicate ligamentous strain.
     
     No abnormal signal within the cord or spinal canal stenosis.

     COMPARISON:  CT angiogram of head dated [**3039-12-20**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Routine non-contrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:  A large left frontal parietotemporal acute intraparenchymal
     hemorrhage with a moderate amount of associated acute subarachnoid blood is
     stable or slightly increased in size since the prior exam.  Low attenuation in
     the adjacent white matter is slightly more prominent.  Mass effect on the
     adjacent sulci is stable.  There is no mass effect on the left lateral
     ventricle, and no evidence of herniation.
     
     Low attenuation in the periventricular white matter bilaterally suggests
     chronic microvascular infarction.  There is a right basal ganglia chronic
     lacunar infarct.  No blood is seen within the ventricles.  Cortical atrophy
     and ventricular prominence are age appropriate. 
     
     No fractures are seen within the imaged bones.  There is a small amount of
     fluid within the right posterior maxillary sinus and bilateral posterior
     sphenoid air cells.  Minimal mucosal thickening lines the left frontal sinus,
     bilateral ethmoid air cells, and the left maxillary sinus.  The mastoid air

Neuro: 
Some spontaneous purposful movement and eye opening noted but exam poor otherwise.  Does not open eyes to voice.  Does not regard examiner or blink to threat.  Corneal reflexes present.  Pupils 2mm reactive bilat.  Gag impaired.  Strong cough to suction.  Rt arm and leg have minimal nonpurposful movement to tactile stimuli.  Lt arm moves spontaneously and is purposful.  Pt localizes with Lt hand to ETT and plays with bed linens.  Lt leg lifts and falls, bends at knee, etc spontaneously.  GCS= E2V1tM5.  Of note, pt has hemodynamic changes when voices are in room- heart rate and BP increase to auditory stimuli.
Oxycodone given x1 dose for premedication for interventions.  Otherwise, had one eposide of grimacing and tachycardia with hypertension above baseline (when daughter left for the day) but pt returned to baseline before intervention required.

RESP:
Remains orally intubated with 7.5 ETT @ 21cm lip line, repositioned and resecured.  Chest intermittantly coarse.  Suctioned for thick tan secretions in small amounts.  Weaned vent support to PSV 5 over 5cmH20 PEEP.  Pt tolerating well, with no decrease in tidal volumes or increased work of breathing.  Sp02 99% on Fi02 .4.  
Regular oral hygiene attended and head of bed maintained >= 30degrees.

CV:
Remains in Afib with rates to 155/min requiring prn metoprolol.  Also having intermittant hypertension for which she has received prn hydralazine.  Otherwise, peripherally tepid, pink, with gross bilateral arm edema and oozing of serous fluid.  1+ pulses.  Peripheral IV x1 patent.  

ENDO:
Remains on q4 hr regular insulin sliding scale and scheduled lantus.  Remains hyperglycemic requiring coverage- today the scale was increased in frequency to q4hr.

GI:
Abd soft, non distended.  Well healed surgical scars present.  Tolerating tube feeds per order with minimal residuals.  Small soft stool x1.

GU:
Foley patent and draining well.

SKIN:
Areas of impairment to Rt arm with open redenned pink blisters which are exuding serous fluid.  DSD intact and wrapped for hygiene.  Otherwise, frail but intact.

SOCIAL:
Daughter visited with friend for support.  Asking appropriate questions.  Very calm but understandably sad due to poor prognosis.  Reassurance offered.  Daughter also had several specific questions about nursing care of a patient who is extubated as a DNR and the distinction between this and care of a patient who is CMO.  Education attended and reassurance offered.  
Pt's son also called requesting updates.  Updates attended.  Son was very angry and decided not to come to visit today in order to avoid interactions with other visitors, although he did express an interest in returning to visit another day.

PLAN:
Pt remains DNR per order in POE.
Continue to monitor neuro exam.
Analgesia prn.
Monitor tolerance of PSV.
Reassess blood sugars.

Resp care
Pt did well with PS/CPAP 5/5 I did not notice any periods of apnia or resp. pauses.  And she did not desaturate during the shift.  Her BS seem generaly clear with only light ocasonal rhonchi which improves post sx.  She had a good RSBI this morning and just might tolerate a SBT very well.  But I would hesitate to extubate her only due to possible poor airway protection.  Her lungs and resp. system seem able to perform well.  if she is able to keep her airway open & clear.

      Place PICC

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Stroke with need for long-term intravenous access.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1458**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1159**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6**], the
     attending radiologist, was present and supervising for the duration of the
     procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  The patient was placed supine on the angiographic
     table.  A pre-procedure timeout confirming the patient, two patient
     identifiers, and the procedure to be performed was performed.  The left arm
     was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.  Ultrasound was used
     to identify the left basilic vein which was patent and compressible.  After
     injection of 1 cc of 1% lidocaine, a 21-gauge needle was advanced under
     ultrasound guidance into the left basilic vein.  Hard-copy ultrasound images
     were obtained before and after venous access documenting patency.  A 0.018
     guidewire was then advanced through the needle to the mid SVC.  The needle was
     then exchanged for a 4.5 French micropuncture sheath.  A 4 French double-lumen
     PICC catheter was then advanced through the sheath under fluoroscopic guidance
     into the distal SVC.  The peel-away sheath and wire were removed.  A final
     fluoroscopic spot image of the chest demonstrates the tip of the catheter to
     be located in the mid SVC.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There
     were no immediate post-procedure complications.  The catheter was flushed,
     heplocked, StatLocked in appropriate position, and covered with sterile
     dressing and Tegaderm.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 4 French double-lumen PICC catheter
     measuring 38 cm.  The tip is located in the mid SVC and the line is ready for
     use.
