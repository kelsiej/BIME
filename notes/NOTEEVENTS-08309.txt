     INDICATION:  55 y/o woman with endstage renal disease on hemodialysis.
     Presents non-febrile with severe abdominal pain.  Rule out pancreatitis.  Rule
     out AAA.
     
     COMPARISONS:  [**2959-12-26**]
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images of the abdomen and pelvis are obtained
     without and with intravenous contrast.
     
     CONTRAST:  150 cc of non-ionic intravenous contrast were administered.  Non-
     ionic contrast was used due to underlying renal disease.
     
     ABDOMEN CT WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  The lung bases show interval
     resolution of small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is minimal bibasilar
     atelectasis. There is a large amount of free fluid throughout the abdomen and
     pelvis. The pancreas has a homogeneous enhancement pattern, with no
     peripancreatic fat stranding.  There are extensive vascular calcifications
     throughout the abdomen and pelvis. Intrathoracic aorta has a normal caliber,
     with no evidence of dissection or aneurysmal dilatation.
     
     The liver, gallbladder, spleen, stomach, small and large bowel are
     unremarkable.  No bowel dilatation, wall edema/thickening or pneumatosis are
     seen to suggest the presence of bowel ischemia.  Bilateral kidneys are
     atrophied, consistent with history of endstage renal disease. Low attenuation
     lesion in the right kidney is unchanged and likely represents a cyst.
     Bilateral adrenal glands are normal. There is no free intraperitoneal gas.
     
     PELVIS CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Uterus and ovaries are not visualized. Rectum,
     pelvic loops of bowel and urinary bladder are unremarkable.  New metal clips
     in the right pelvis have uncertain significance.  There is extensive of
     intraabdominal ascites into the pelvis.
     
     Osseous structures are unremarkable. Superficial soft tissues show extensive
     anasarca.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Entire aorta with normal caliber and no evidence of
     dissection.  2)  Extensive vasculopathy.  3)  Extensive ascites in the abdomen
     and pelvis are increased in size since prior study.  No evidence of abscess
     formation. 4) Pancreas with homogeneous enhancement.  The presence of
     peripancreatic inflammation cannot be fully assessed due to extensive ascites.

Admission Date:  [**2960-4-13**]     Discharge Date:  [**2960-4-22**]

Date of Birth:   [**2905-2-13**]     Sex:  F


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 55-year-old
female with a past medical history of end-stage renal
disease, diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension,
high cholesterol, peripheral vascular disease (status post
gastrointestinal bleed with chronic guaiac-positive stools
who presented with increased abdominal pain since [**2960-4-10**].  The patient states that she had an abdominal
paracentesis on [**4-10**] where 2 liters of fluid was removed.
She states the tap was done because the patient had an
increased abdominal girth.

patient states she had increased abdominal pain which had
been increasing until she presented to the hospital.  The
pain is diffuse throughout her abdomen and increased when she
sits up.  She had a positive bowel movement yesterday which
was within normal limits.  No diarrhea.  She has had nausea
and vomiting yesterday.

Of note, the patient has had multiple medical admissions in
the recent past.  In [**2959-12-15**] she was admitted with
the diagnosis of mesenteric ischemia versus gastritis.
Flexible sigmoidoscopy was complicated by bleeding, and
ascites was noted but not tapped.  Hepatitis serologies were
negative.  She was readmitted several days after discharge
with a headache and lightheadedness.  Her hematocrit was
14.7.  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy led to gastritis.  A
colonoscopy revealed polyps and diverticula.  A small-bowel
follow-through was negative.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarction.
 2.  Diabetes.
 3.  Hypertension.
 4.  End-stage renal disease.
 5.  Cryptogenic cirrhosis.
 6.  Bilateral below-knee amputation.
 7.  High cholesterol.
 8.  Asthma.
 9.  Gastritis.
10.  Lower gastrointestinal bleed with chronic
guaiac-positive stools.
11.  Peripheral vascular disease versus calciphylaxis.
12.  Bilateral frequent gangrene.
13.  Status post appendectomy.
14.  Left arteriovenous fistula.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications on admission included
Lopressor 75 mg p.o. b.i.d., clonidine 0.2 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
hydralazine 100 mg p.o. t.i.d., nitroglycerin patch as
needed, carafate 1 g p.o. q.d., Phos-Lo 3 tablets p.o.
t.i.d., nifedipine-CR 120 mg p.o. q.d., Zestril 60 mg p.o.
q.d., Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d., enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg
p.o. q.d., Xanax 0.25 mg p.o. b.i.d., Dilaudid 4 mg to 5 mg
p.o. q.2-4h. as needed, Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d., Senna two
tablets p.o. q.p.m. as needed for constipation.

ALLERGIES:  Allergies include VANCOMYCIN, PENICILLIN, SULFA
DRUGS, KEFLEX, and CIPROFLOXACIN.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed the patient was afebrile, heart rate
was 80, blood pressure was 161/91, respiratory rate was 20.
In general, she was a frail African-American female, lying in
bed, appeared uncomfortable.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and
throat was unremarkable.  Cardiovascular examination revealed
a regular rate and rhythm.  Normal first heart sound and
second heart sound.  Lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  The abdomen was tense, distended, diffusely
tender; especially in the lower quadrant in the right lower
quadrant around the paracentesis site.  Extremities revealed
bilateral below-knee amputations, and fingers were wrapped in
ACE.  The patient requested not to unwrap.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories on
admission were significant for a creatinine of 4.3, a white
blood cell count of 8.2, and a hematocrit of 18.7 (down
from 26).  An ascites tap revealed 1175 white blood cells
with 73% polymorphonuclear leukocytes.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A chest x-ray revealed no pneumothorax.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was initially admitted to the
floor for management of her hematocrit drop.

1.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  A CT scan was performed which revealed
blood present in the peritoneal cavity.  There was an active
source of extravasation seen.  Because of these results, the
patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

There, she was given fresh frozen plasma, vitamin K,
desmopressin acetate, and packed red blood cells.  Surgery
was consulted but did not think the patient emergently needed
surgery.   They recommended that she go to Interventional
Radiology.

On approximately the third hospital day, the patient was
taken to Interventional Radiology where she underwent an
embolization procedure.  Substantially following that, the
patient's hematocrit stabilized.

She was followed in the Intensive Care Unit.  She
subsequently was able to maintain her hematocrit; although,
she required a few blood transfusions.  No further treatment
was needed for her bleeding.  The patient also
had large volume paracenteses several times in house, and she
seemed to tolerate this reasonably well.  She was called out
to the floor on [**4-18**].

2.  RENAL:  The patient underwent hemodialysis while she was
in house.  She continued to do well with this.

3.  DIABETES:  The patient had several low blood sugars and
was treated with D-50; but, otherwise, she seemed to do
reasonably well.  There were some issues with patient
compliance.  She was refusing some of her medications, but
these were ultimately resolved.

4.  HEMATOLOGY:  Twice per day hematocrit checks were done
following discharge from the unit, but she remained
hemodynamically stable.  She ultimately required a total of
four units during her hospital stay.

5.  PAIN:  The patient had significant abdominal pain.  This
was her main issue on the floor.  We were attempting to get
this under control so that she would be safe for discharge.

A Pain Management consultation was obtained.  She was started
on a Fentanyl patch and given p.o. Dilaudid.  She had no
evidence of over sedation, and this regimen seemed to work
reasonably well for her.

The patient ultimately had her pain controlled with a
Fentanyl patch and Dilaudid.   She was deemed safe to go
home.   She was to follow up with her primary care physician
(Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]) and was to follow up with the Gastroenterology
Clinic as necessary.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:   Anemia secondary to
bleeding into peritoneum.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:   She was to follow up with her primary
care physician (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]).

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Lopressor 75 mg p.o. b.i.d.
 2.  Clonidine 0.2 mg p.o. b.i.d.
 3.  Hydralazine 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.
 4.  Nitroglycerin patch as needed.
 5.  Carafate 1 g p.o. q.d.
 6.  Phos-Lo 3 tablets p.o. t.i.d.
 7.  Nifedipine-CR 120 mg p.o. q.d.
 8.  Zestril 60 mg p.o. q.d.
 9.  Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
10.  Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
11.  Xanax 0.25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
12.  Dilaudid 4 mg to 5 mg p.o. q.2-4h. as needed.
13.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
14.  Senna two tablets p.o. q.p.m. as needed for
constipation.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  55 year old woman with severe abdominal pain.  Status post
     paracentesis 4 days ago.  Nausea and vomiting.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:
     
     COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with prior study performed [**2960-3-27**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous serial axial images were obtained from the lung bases
     to the pubic symphysis after the administration of 150 cc of nonionic Optiray
     contrast.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The visualized lung bases demonstrates
     linear opacities representing scarring or atelectasis at both lung bases
     (right greater than left).  There are no pleural effusions or pulmonary
     nodules.  The liver, pancreas, spleen, and adrenals are grossly unremarkable.
     The kidneys are atrophic.  The right renal cyst is unchanged in appearance
     measuring approximately 12 x 26 mm.  There are extensive vascular
     calcifications.
     
     There is extensive ascites increased from prior study.  Heterogeneous high
     attenuation fluid is noted within the right upper quadrant tracking along the
     inferior liver margin and anteriorly along the abdominal wall.  A small oblong
     approximately 7 x 4 mm high attenuation focus is present just deep to the
     intercostal musculature at the level of the L2 vertebral body.  Delayed images
     through this region demonstrate local dispersion of this high attenuation
     focus.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Extensive ascites is again noted. Intrapelvic
     loops of bowel are grossly unremarkable.  Surgical clips are again noted in
     the right lower quadrant.  The uterus and ovaries are not visualized.
     Extensive vascular calcifications are present.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  The osseous structures are grossly unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Interval increase in abdominal ascites with high attenuation fluid in the
     right upper quadrant consistent with hemorrhage.  Active extravasation is
     present just deep to the lateral intercostal musculature at the level of T2.
     The findings discussed with house staff at time of study.

      CT showing active bleeding who had a dropping hematocrit 
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY AND INDICATION:  55 year old lady with ESRD, hematocrit drop and CT
     showing active extravasation into the right flank, likely from recent
     paracentesis causing vascular injury.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Attending Radiologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 79**] [**Name (STitle) 43**] d'Othee,
     Interventional Radiology Fellow Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 340**] [**Name (STitle) 341**].
     
     TECHNIQUE: Informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to the
     procedure. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 43**] [**Name (STitle) 44**] was present for the entirety of the procedure.
     The patient was placed supine on the angiography table. The right groin was
     sterilely prepped and draped and after local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine, a
     19-gauge needle was used to access the right common femoral artery. Under
     fluoroscopic observation, a 0.035 [**Location (un) 2580**] J guide wire was passed into the
     abdominal aorta, and over this a 5-French sheath was placed, and connected to
     irrigation from a pressure bag. Through the sheath and over a wire, a 4-French
     SOS Omni Flush catheter was advanced into the upper abdominal aorta, and an AP
     aortic angiogram was performed.
     The catheter was removed and through the sheath a 5-French Cobra was used to
     select the right intercostal arteries. A selective angiogram of the right
     ninth intercostal artery demonstrated no extravasation.
     The catheter was replaced with a 5-French Mikaelsson catheter, and selective
     angiography of the right lower intercostals was attempted. An angiogram of the
     rigth eleventh intercostal artery did not show any active bleeding. An
     angiogram of the right twelfth intercostal artery via the Mikaelsson catheter
     demonstrated area of active extravasation from a small branch in the right
     flank.
     Through this catheter, a 3-French microcatheter was placed into the
     intercostal artery approximately 6 cm from the origin. Selective angiogram
     demonstrated continued extravasation from the site and no reflux. Through the
     microcatheter, approximately 4 cc of a Gelfoam slurry was slowly administered
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     under fluoroscopic observation until stasis was achieved, with no proximal
     reflux observed.
     Post-procedure selective angiogram through the microcatheter demonstrated
     stasis in the main 12th intercostal artery. Control selective angiogram of the
     same artery via the Mikaelsson catheter demonstrated no flow in the entirety
     of the intercostal artery, and stasis of flow within the intercostal when the
     Mikaelsson catheter was disengaged from the orifice during the contrast
     injection.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  No complications were evident.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  Under continuous hemodynamic monitoring, small divided doses of
     Versed totaling 1.5 mg and Fentanyl totaling 75 mcg were administered
     intravenously for conscious sedation. Local lidocaine consisted of 1%
     lidocaine without epinephrine. A total of 108 ml of non-ionic contrast was
     administered intraarterially.
     
     FINDINGS:  Angiogram of the aorta did not demonstrate clear extravasation. No
     significant atherosclerotic disease was seen in the aorta. Angiogram of the
     right ninth amd eleventh intercostal arteries demonstrated patent arteries
     with no evidence of extravasation. Angiogram of the right twelfth intercostal
     artery demonstrated extravasation consistent with vascular injury in the
     portion alongside the flank arising from a small branch from the main trunk of
     the intercostal artery. Subselective angiogram confirmed these findings.
     Post-procedure angiogram through the microcatheter demonstrates stasis within
     the vessel. Post-procedure angiogram through the Mikaelsson catheter
     demonstrated stasis of flow within the right twelfth intercostal artery.
     
     IMPRESSION:

      CT showing active bleeding who had a dropping hematocrit 
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY AND INDICATION:  55 year old lady with ESRD, hematocrit drop and CT
     showing active extravasation into the right flank, likely from recent
     paracentesis causing vascular injury.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Attending Radiologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 79**] [**Name (STitle) 43**] d'Othee,
     Interventional Radiology Fellow Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 340**] [**Name (STitle) 341**].
     
     TECHNIQUE: Informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to the
     procedure. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 43**] [**Name (STitle) 44**] was present for the entirety of the procedure.
     The patient was placed supine on the angiography table. The right groin was
     sterilely prepped and draped and after local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine, a
     19-gauge needle was used to access the right common femoral artery. Under
     fluoroscopic observation, a 0.035 [**Location (un) 2580**] J guide wire was passed into the
     abdominal aorta, and over this a 5-French sheath was placed, and connected to
     irrigation from a pressure bag. Through the sheath and over a wire, a 4-French
     SOS Omni Flush catheter was advanced into the upper abdominal aorta, and an AP
     aortic angiogram was performed.
     The catheter was removed and through the sheath a 5-French Cobra was used to
     select the right intercostal arteries. A selective angiogram of the right
     ninth intercostal artery demonstrated no extravasation.
     The catheter was replaced with a 5-French Mikaelsson catheter, and selective
     angiography of the right lower intercostals was attempted. An angiogram of the
     rigth eleventh intercostal artery did not show any active bleeding. An
     angiogram of the right twelfth intercostal artery via the Mikaelsson catheter
     demonstrated area of active extravasation from a small branch in the right
     flank.
     Through this catheter, a 3-French microcatheter was placed into the
     intercostal artery approximately 6 cm from the origin. Selective angiogram
     demonstrated continued extravasation from the site and no reflux. Through the
     microcatheter, approximately 4 cc of a Gelfoam slurry was slowly administered
                                                                 (Over)

     under fluoroscopic observation until stasis was achieved, with no proximal
     reflux observed.
     Post-procedure selective angiogram through the microcatheter demonstrated
     stasis in the main 12th intercostal artery. Control selective angiogram of the
     same artery via the Mikaelsson catheter demonstrated no flow in the entirety
     of the intercostal artery, and stasis of flow within the intercostal when the
     Mikaelsson catheter was disengaged from the orifice during the contrast
     injection.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  No complications were evident.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  Under continuous hemodynamic monitoring, small divided doses of
     Versed totaling 1.5 mg and Fentanyl totaling 75 mcg were administered
     intravenously for conscious sedation. Local lidocaine consisted of 1%
     lidocaine without epinephrine. A total of 108 ml of non-ionic contrast was
     administered intraarterially.
     
     FINDINGS:  Angiogram of the aorta did not demonstrate clear extravasation. No
     significant atherosclerotic disease was seen in the aorta. Angiogram of the
     right ninth amd eleventh intercostal arteries demonstrated patent arteries
     with no evidence of extravasation. Angiogram of the right twelfth intercostal
     artery demonstrated extravasation consistent with vascular injury in the
     portion alongside the flank arising from a small branch from the main trunk of
     the intercostal artery. Subselective angiogram confirmed these findings.
     Post-procedure angiogram through the microcatheter demonstrates stasis within
     the vessel. Post-procedure angiogram through the Mikaelsson catheter
     demonstrated stasis of flow within the right twelfth intercostal artery.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Selective angiogram of the right twelfth intercostal artery demonstrates
     active extravasation, likely from vascular injury from prior paracentesis.
     
     2) Right twelfth intercostal artery successfully embolized with Gelfoam
     slurry, and no further bleeding seen on angiograms after embolization.

     The catheter was removed and through the sheath a 5-French Cobra was used to
     select the right intercostal arteries. A selective angiogram of the right
     ninth intercostal artery demonstrated no extravasation.
     The catheter was replaced with a 5-French Mikaelsson catheter, and selective
     angiography of the right lower intercostals was attempted. An angiogram of the
     rigth eleventh intercostal artery did not show any active bleeding. An
     angiogram of the right twelfth intercostal artery via the Mikaelsson catheter
     demonstrated area of active extravasation from a small branch in the right
     flank.
     Through this catheter, a 3-French microcatheter was placed into the
     intercostal artery approximately 6 cm from the origin. Selective angiogram
     demonstrated continued extravasation from the site and no reflux. Through the
     microcatheter, approximately 4 cc of a Gelfoam slurry was slowly administered

     under fluoroscopic observation until stasis was achieved, with no proximal
     reflux observed.
     Post-procedure selective angiogram through the microcatheter demonstrated
     stasis in the main 12th intercostal artery. Control selective angiogram of the
     same artery via the Mikaelsson catheter demonstrated no flow in the entirety
     of the intercostal artery, and stasis of flow within the intercostal when the
     Mikaelsson catheter was disengaged from the orifice during the contrast
     injection.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  No complications were evident.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  Under continuous hemodynamic monitoring, small divided doses of
     Versed totaling 1.5 mg and Fentanyl totaling 75 mcg were administered
     intravenously for conscious sedation. Local lidocaine consisted of 1%
     lidocaine without epinephrine. A total of 108 ml of non-ionic contrast was
     administered intraarterially.
     
     FINDINGS:  Angiogram of the aorta did not demonstrate clear extravasation. No
     significant atherosclerotic disease was seen in the aorta. Angiogram of the
     right ninth amd eleventh intercostal arteries demonstrated patent arteries
     with no evidence of extravasation. Angiogram of the right twelfth intercostal
     artery demonstrated extravasation consistent with vascular injury in the
     portion alongside the flank arising from a small branch from the main trunk of
     the intercostal artery. Subselective angiogram confirmed these findings.
     Post-procedure angiogram through the microcatheter demonstrates stasis within
     the vessel. Post-procedure angiogram through the Mikaelsson catheter
     demonstrated stasis of flow within the right twelfth intercostal artery.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Selective angiogram of the right twelfth intercostal artery demonstrates
     active extravasation, likely from vascular injury from prior paracentesis.
     
     2) Right twelfth intercostal artery successfully embolized with Gelfoam
     slurry, and no further bleeding seen on angiograms after embolization.

     The patient was placed supine on the angiography table. The right groin was
     sterilely prepped and draped and after local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine, a
     19-gauge needle was used to access the right common femoral artery. Under
     fluoroscopic observation, a 0.035 [**Location (un) 2580**] J guide wire was passed into the
     abdominal aorta, and over this a 5-French sheath was placed, and connected to
     irrigation from a pressure bag. Through the sheath and over a wire, a 4-French

      pt who has falling hematocrit and bloody abdominal paracenetesis with abdominal
      CT showing active bleeding who had a dropping hematocrit 
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY AND INDICATION:  55 year old lady with ESRD, hematocrit drop and CT
     showing active extravasation into the right flank, likely from recent
     paracentesis causing vascular injury.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Attending Radiologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 79**] [**Name (STitle) 43**] d'Othee,
     Interventional Radiology Fellow Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 340**] [**Name (STitle) 341**].
     
     TECHNIQUE: Informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to the
     procedure. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 43**] [**Name (STitle) 44**] was present for the entirety of the procedure.
     The patient was placed supine on the angiography table. The right groin was
     sterilely prepped and draped and after local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine, a
     19-gauge needle was used to access the right common femoral artery. Under
     fluoroscopic observation, a 0.035 [**Location (un) 2580**] J guide wire was passed into the
     abdominal aorta, and over this a 5-French sheath was placed, and connected to
     irrigation from a pressure bag. Through the sheath and over a wire, a 4-French
     SOS Omni Flush catheter was advanced into the upper abdominal aorta, and an AP
     aortic angiogram was performed.
     The catheter was removed and through the sheath a 5-French Cobra was used to
     select the right intercostal arteries. A selective angiogram of the right
     ninth intercostal artery demonstrated no extravasation.
     The catheter was replaced with a 5-French Mikaelsson catheter, and selective
     angiography of the right lower intercostals was attempted. An angiogram of the
     rigth eleventh intercostal artery did not show any active bleeding. An
     angiogram of the right twelfth intercostal artery via the Mikaelsson catheter
     demonstrated area of active extravasation from a small branch in the right
     flank.
     Through this catheter, a 3-French microcatheter was placed into the
     intercostal artery approximately 6 cm from the origin. Selective angiogram
     demonstrated continued extravasation from the site and no reflux. Through the
     microcatheter, approximately 4 cc of a Gelfoam slurry was slowly administered
                                                                 (Over)

     under fluoroscopic observation until stasis was achieved, with no proximal
     reflux observed.
     Post-procedure selective angiogram through the microcatheter demonstrated
     stasis in the main 12th intercostal artery. Control selective angiogram of the
     same artery via the Mikaelsson catheter demonstrated no flow in the entirety
     of the intercostal artery, and stasis of flow within the intercostal when the
     Mikaelsson catheter was disengaged from the orifice during the contrast
     injection.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  No complications were evident.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  Under continuous hemodynamic monitoring, small divided doses of
     Versed totaling 1.5 mg and Fentanyl totaling 75 mcg were administered
     intravenously for conscious sedation. Local lidocaine consisted of 1%
     lidocaine without epinephrine. A total of 108 ml of non-ionic contrast was
     administered intraarterially.
     
     FINDINGS:  Angiogram of the aorta did not demonstrate clear extravasation. No
     significant atherosclerotic disease was seen in the aorta. Angiogram of the
     right ninth amd eleventh intercostal arteries demonstrated patent arteries
     with no evidence of extravasation. Angiogram of the right twelfth intercostal
     artery demonstrated extravasation consistent with vascular injury in the
     portion alongside the flank arising from a small branch from the main trunk of
     the intercostal artery. Subselective angiogram confirmed these findings.
     Post-procedure angiogram through the microcatheter demonstrates stasis within
     the vessel. Post-procedure angiogram through the Mikaelsson catheter
     demonstrated stasis of flow within the right twelfth intercostal artery.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Selective angiogram of the right twelfth intercostal artery demonstrates
     active extravasation, likely from vascular injury from prior paracentesis.
     
     2) Right twelfth intercostal artery successfully embolized with Gelfoam
     slurry, and no further bleeding seen on angiograms after embolization.

     rigth eleventh intercostal artery did not show any active bleeding. An
     angiogram of the right twelfth intercostal artery via the Mikaelsson catheter
     demonstrated area of active extravasation from a small branch in the right
     flank.
     Through this catheter, a 3-French microcatheter was placed into the
     intercostal artery approximately 6 cm from the origin. Selective angiogram
     demonstrated continued extravasation from the site and no reflux. Through the
     microcatheter, approximately 4 cc of a Gelfoam slurry was slowly administered

     under fluoroscopic observation until stasis was achieved, with no proximal
     reflux observed.
     Post-procedure selective angiogram through the microcatheter demonstrated
     stasis in the main 12th intercostal artery. Control selective angiogram of the
     same artery via the Mikaelsson catheter demonstrated no flow in the entirety
     of the intercostal artery, and stasis of flow within the intercostal when the
     Mikaelsson catheter was disengaged from the orifice during the contrast
     injection.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  No complications were evident.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  Under continuous hemodynamic monitoring, small divided doses of
     Versed totaling 1.5 mg and Fentanyl totaling 75 mcg were administered
     intravenously for conscious sedation. Local lidocaine consisted of 1%
     lidocaine without epinephrine. A total of 108 ml of non-ionic contrast was
     administered intraarterially.
     
     FINDINGS:  Angiogram of the aorta did not demonstrate clear extravasation. No
     significant atherosclerotic disease was seen in the aorta. Angiogram of the
     right ninth amd eleventh intercostal arteries demonstrated patent arteries
     with no evidence of extravasation. Angiogram of the right twelfth intercostal
     artery demonstrated extravasation consistent with vascular injury in the
     portion alongside the flank arising from a small branch from the main trunk of
     the intercostal artery. Subselective angiogram confirmed these findings.
     Post-procedure angiogram through the microcatheter demonstrates stasis within
     the vessel. Post-procedure angiogram through the Mikaelsson catheter
     demonstrated stasis of flow within the right twelfth intercostal artery.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Selective angiogram of the right twelfth intercostal artery demonstrates
     active extravasation, likely from vascular injury from prior paracentesis.
     
     2) Right twelfth intercostal artery successfully embolized with Gelfoam
     slurry, and no further bleeding seen on angiograms after embolization.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY AND INDICATION:  55 year old lady with ESRD, hematocrit drop and CT
     showing active extravasation into the right flank, likely from recent
     paracentesis causing vascular injury.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Attending Radiologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 79**] [**Name (STitle) 43**] d'Othee,
     Interventional Radiology Fellow Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 340**] [**Name (STitle) 341**].
     
     TECHNIQUE: Informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to the
     procedure. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 43**] [**Name (STitle) 44**] was present for the entirety of the procedure.
     The patient was placed supine on the angiography table. The right groin was
     sterilely prepped and draped and after local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine, a
     19-gauge needle was used to access the right common femoral artery. Under
     fluoroscopic observation, a 0.035 [**Location (un) 2580**] J guide wire was passed into the
     abdominal aorta, and over this a 5-French sheath was placed, and connected to
     irrigation from a pressure bag. Through the sheath and over a wire, a 4-French
     SOS Omni Flush catheter was advanced into the upper abdominal aorta, and an AP
     aortic angiogram was performed.
     The catheter was removed and through the sheath a 5-French Cobra was used to
     select the right intercostal arteries. A selective angiogram of the right
     ninth intercostal artery demonstrated no extravasation.
     The catheter was replaced with a 5-French Mikaelsson catheter, and selective
     angiography of the right lower intercostals was attempted. An angiogram of the
     rigth eleventh intercostal artery did not show any active bleeding. An
     angiogram of the right twelfth intercostal artery via the Mikaelsson catheter
     demonstrated area of active extravasation from a small branch in the right
     flank.

     intercostal artery approximately 6 cm from the origin. Selective angiogram
     demonstrated continued extravasation from the site and no reflux. Through the
     microcatheter, approximately 4 cc of a Gelfoam slurry was slowly administered

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Fifty-five year old with vascular disease experiences chest pressure 
     and associated shortness of breath.  No significant change in the EKG as
     measured at outpatient office today.  Upon reporting to our department, the
     patient no longer is experiencing chest pressure.  After consultation with the
     ordering physician, [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] sestamibi injection was performed. 
      
     INTERPRETATION:  Following the injection of sestamibi while patient was not 
     experiencing chest pain, static and gated SPECT images were obtained and
     analyzed.   
     Imaging Protocol:  gated SPECT.
      
     Images show soft tissue attenuation producing focal deficit of activity at the
     cardiac apex.
      
     Gated images show no identifiable perfusion defects and there is normal wall
     thickening throughout the left ventricular myocardium.  Left ventricular
     ejection fraction was calculated to be approximately 45%.
      
     The above findings suggest no identifiable perfusion defects.
      
     Compared with the prior exam of [**2960-1-24**], there is no significant interval
     change.
      
     IMPRESSION:  Soft tissue attenuation at the apex.  No identifiable perfusion
     defects.  No significant change from the prior study. /nkg

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     INDICATION:  History of end stage renal disease on dialysis. Diabetes, PVD,
     CAD. Presents with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and epigastric discomfort. Rule
     out colitis or ischemic bowel.
     
     COMPARISONS: [**2960-4-14**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained
     with IV contrast. Coronal reconstruction images were also obtained.
     
     CONTRAST:  Oral contrast and 100 cc of nonionic IV contrast was administered.
     Nonionic IV contrast was used due to chronic renal failure.  Patient should be
     dialysed within 24 hours from the time of this study.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The lung bases are clear. There are extensive
     coronary calcifications.  NG tube has distal tip in the stomach. The liver,
     spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, stomach, and adrenal glands are unremarkable.
     There is extensive intra abdominal vasculopathy with mural calcifications
     involving the large and small arteries.  The kidneys are small consistent with
     end stage renal disease.  Small bowel contains oral contrast and is not
     significantly dilated to suggest the presence of bowel obstruction.  Entire
     colon contains no contrast and exhibits severe wall edema but no pneumatosis.
     There is a large amount of ascites in the abdomen, not significantly changed
     from the prior study.  There is no free intraperitoneal gas.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is edema involving the wall of the sigmoid
     colon and rectum, without  pneumatosis.  The uterus and ovaries are not seen.
     The urinary bladder is not distended.  There is extension of ascites into the
     pelvis.  Extensive small and large vessel vasculopathy is also seen in the
     pelvis.
     
     The osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     Coronal reconstruction images confirm the above findings.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Extensive ascites in the abdomen and pelvis, unchanged from the prior
     study.
     2. Extensive vasculopathy of small and large vessels.
     3. No evidence of small bowel obstruction.

     changed from prior study. There is extensive ascites, unchanged from prior
     study. Intraabdominal loops of bowel are grossly unremarkable.  The spleen is
     prominent.
     
     CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is extensive pelvic ascites.  Marked
     diffuse vascular calcifications.  Intrapelvic loops of bowel unremarkable.
     There has been interval resolution of the previously noted bowel wall edema.
     There are small bilateral inguinal lymph nodes, the largest of which is on the
     left and measures approximately 9 mm in greatest short axis dimension.  These
     are slightly larger compared to the prior study.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Osseous structures demonstrate mild degenerative changes but
     are otherwise unremarkable.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Diabetes with cirrhosis and fevers, rule out sinusitis.
     
     Multiple thin axial images were obtained through the paranasal sinuses.
     Coronal reconstructions were performed.
     
     The visualized paranasal sinuses are well aerated and clear.  No air fluid
     levels or bony destruction is seen.  The nasal septum is mostly in the midline
     and the ostiomeatal complexes are patent.  There are benign dural
     calcifications along the falx as noted on a prior head CT from [**2959-7-19**].
     Small areas of enostosis are noted involving the inner table of the skull in
     the frontal region.  There is opacification of the mastoid sinuses due to
     inflammatory disease.  This was not present on the prior head CT from July
     2001.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence for acute sinusitis.  Partially opacified left
     mastoid sinus most likely due to inflammatory disease.  It should be noted
     that the mastoids were partially out of the field of view and were not fully
     evaluated.  If the patient has middle ear symptoms, correlation with thin cuts
     through the temporal bones would be helpful.

     SUMMARY OF EXERCISE DATA FROM THE REPORT OF THE EXERCISE LAB:
     Persantine was infused intravenously for approximately 4 minutes at a  dose of 
     approximately 0.142 mg/kg/min.  No chest, arm, neck or back pain. There were no
     EKG changes.
      
     HISTORY:  Fifty-five year old woman here for evaluation of coronary artery 
     disease.
      
     INTERPRETATION:  One to three minutes after the cessation of infusion, 
     MIBI was administered IV.
      
     Image Protocol: Gated SPECT.
      
     Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium.
     Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.
      
     Stress and resting perfusion images show a small mild, fixed apical defect.  A
     moderate, fixed defect is also appreciated in the inferior wall, involving the
     base and extending into the lateral wall.  The lateral wall component shows
     reversibility.   In comparison to prior exam of [**2960-1-24**], there is no significant
     change. 
      
     Ejection fraction visually estimated from gated wall motion images obtained
     after Persantine administration is approximately 50-55%.  There is normal wall
     motion.
      
     IMPRESSION:  Mild, fixed apical defect.  Moderate fixed defect at the base of
     the inferior wall.   Moderate lateral wall reversible defect.  No significant
     change compared to the previous study.  /nkg

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Fifty-five year old woman with multiple medical problems including  
     CAD, DM, ESRD, and severe PVD, who complains of intermittent episodes of
     epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting. 
      
     INTERPRETATION:  Following the oral ingestion of a meal of radiolabeled
     egg-whites, the patient was placed supine beneath the gamma camera.  Multiple
     anterior and posterior images of the tracer activity in the stomach and bowel
     were recorded initially for 60 minutes.  After the first 60 minutes of imaging,
     there is virtually no emptying of stomach contents from the stomach. 
     (Calculated emptying was -3%.) 
      
     The patient was imaged for another 16 minutes after which time she could not
     tolerate image any longer and had to get up to a sitting position and off the
     gamma camera for relief.  There appears to be a small amount of emptying at
     approximately minute 75, at the end of the these 16 minutes of imaging.  The
     patient was then brought back to the imaging table at approximately 90 minutes
     post-ingestion for further imaging.  However, at this time it appeared that the
     stomach contents had largely emptied by the time imaging was re-started. 
      
     IMPRESSION:  Delayed gastric emptying.  Very little emptying for the first 75
     minutes, followed by prompt emptying after sitting upright. /nkg

     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 513**] who supervised and was present for the entire procedure.
     
     INDICATIONS:  This patient is a 55 year old woman with a history of multiple
     finger gangrene involving both hands who presents for upper-extremity
     arteriogram for vascular evaluation.
     
     MEDICATIONS ADMINISTERED:  1 mg of IV Versed and 50 mcg of IV fentanyl both
     given in divided doses under continuous hemodynamic monitoring.  8 cc of 1%
     lidocaine local was used and 150 cc of 15% Optiray contrast was administered
     throughout the procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  After the patient consented to the procedure she was placed in the
     supine position on the fluoroscopy table.  Each arm was extended when
     necessary to obtain arm angiograms.  The right groin was shaved, prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile manner.  The right common femoral artery was
     identified with fluoroscopic guidance based upon bony landmarks.  The area was
     infiltrated with 8 cc of 1% lidocaine.  A small skin [**Doctor Last Name 1197**] was made with an 11
     blade and a 19-gauge single wall puncture needle was inserted into the common
     femoral artery.  A .035 [**Last Name (un) 223**] guide wire was inserted into the abdominal
     aorta and the needle was exchanged for a 5-French sheath.  The side arm was
     attached to heparinized saline which infused throughout the case. Over the
     guide wire, a 5-French, 100-cm-in-length pigtail catheter was inserted and
     under fluoroscopic guidance was placed in the ascending aorta. An arch
     aortogram was performed including a view of the subclavian and carotid
     arteries bilaterally.  This arch aortogram was performed in a left anterior
     oblique projection.  The pigtail catheter was exchanged for a 5-French [**Location (un) 4608**]
     catheter which was inserted into the upper descending aorta.  The [**Last Name (un) 223**]
     guide wire was exchanged for a .035-inch angled Glidewire and under
     fluoroscopic guidance the catheter was advanced into the right subclavian
     artery.  Right arm arteriogram was performed.  Runoff films were performed
     with the catheter tip advanced into the right brachial artery.  The catheter

     was then pulled back into the proximal descending aorta and redirected under
     fluoroscopic guidance with the use of the angled Glidewire into the left
     subclavian artery.  A left upper extremity runoff angiogram was performed with
     distal films performed as the catheter tip was placed in the brachial artery.
     Poor runoff was noted, therefore, a blood-pressure cuff was placed over the
     upper arm and inflated to 120 mm Hg to occlude the upper arm arteriovenous
     fistula for better perfusion of the hand.  Runoff was performed including the
     hand.  The catheter was then removed.  The sheath was removed and adequate
     hemostasis was achieved with 15 minutes of manual pressure at the puncture
     site on the right common femoral artery.  The patient tolerated the procedure
     well.  No immediate complications were noted.
     
     FINDINGS: Incidentally noted bovine arch, which is normal in appearance. Great
     vessels are also normal.  There is an early takeoff of the right radial
     artery, at the level of the mid humerus.  The right arm runoff was significant
     for extensive below- elbow disease. The radial artery on the right is the
     dominant artery and form the palmar arch. Both interosseous and ulnar arteries
     are occluded proximally.  The ulnar artery reconstitutes but fills late. The
     deep arch fills via the radial artery.   The superficial arch does not
     opacify.
      The left upper extremity runoff included a patent radial artery with runoff
     into the hand. The ulnar artery is occluded at its origin. Patent interosseous
     artery is noted proximally but occludes thereafter.    The widely patent
     brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistula is noted. There is no significant flow
     change to the left hand following inflation of a blood pressure cuff, and
     therefore no evidence of steal syndrome is present.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No inflow disease to the bilateral upper extremities. Significant
     bilateral below-elbow vessel disease, left greater than right with bilateral
     radial arteries feeding the deep palmar arches.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      patient with end stage renal disease, arterial disease with poor perfusion to
      both hands resulting in multi-digit ischemia.  s/p brachiocephalic av fistula
      left arm.  Need to assess digital perfusion to all digits, to determine whether
      amputations will heal.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     PROCEDURE:  Bilateral upper-extremity arteriogram.  Arch aortogram.
     PHYSICIANS PERFORMING THE PROCEDURE:  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6093**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6094**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 513**] who supervised and was present for the entire procedure.
     
     INDICATIONS:  This patient is a 55 year old woman with a history of multiple
     finger gangrene involving both hands who presents for upper-extremity
     arteriogram for vascular evaluation.
     
     MEDICATIONS ADMINISTERED:  1 mg of IV Versed and 50 mcg of IV fentanyl both
     given in divided doses under continuous hemodynamic monitoring.  8 cc of 1%
     lidocaine local was used and 150 cc of 15% Optiray contrast was administered
     throughout the procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  After the patient consented to the procedure she was placed in the
     supine position on the fluoroscopy table.  Each arm was extended when
     necessary to obtain arm angiograms.  The right groin was shaved, prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile manner.  The right common femoral artery was
     identified with fluoroscopic guidance based upon bony landmarks.  The area was
     infiltrated with 8 cc of 1% lidocaine.  A small skin [**Doctor Last Name 1197**] was made with an 11
     blade and a 19-gauge single wall puncture needle was inserted into the common
     femoral artery.  A .035 [**Last Name (un) 223**] guide wire was inserted into the abdominal
     aorta and the needle was exchanged for a 5-French sheath.  The side arm was
     attached to heparinized saline which infused throughout the case. Over the
     guide wire, a 5-French, 100-cm-in-length pigtail catheter was inserted and
     under fluoroscopic guidance was placed in the ascending aorta. An arch
     aortogram was performed including a view of the subclavian and carotid
     arteries bilaterally.  This arch aortogram was performed in a left anterior
     oblique projection.  The pigtail catheter was exchanged for a 5-French [**Location (un) 4608**]
     catheter which was inserted into the upper descending aorta.  The [**Last Name (un) 223**]
     guide wire was exchanged for a .035-inch angled Glidewire and under
     fluoroscopic guidance the catheter was advanced into the right subclavian
     artery.  Right arm arteriogram was performed.  Runoff films were performed
     with the catheter tip advanced into the right brachial artery.  The catheter

     PHYSICIANS PERFORMING THE PROCEDURE:  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6093**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6094**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 513**] who supervised and was present for the entire procedure.
     
     INDICATIONS:  This patient is a 55 year old woman with a history of multiple
     finger gangrene involving both hands who presents for upper-extremity
     arteriogram for vascular evaluation.
     
     MEDICATIONS ADMINISTERED:  1 mg of IV Versed and 50 mcg of IV fentanyl both
     given in divided doses under continuous hemodynamic monitoring.  8 cc of 1%
     lidocaine local was used and 150 cc of 15% Optiray contrast was administered
     throughout the procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  After the patient consented to the procedure she was placed in the
     supine position on the fluoroscopy table.  Each arm was extended when
     necessary to obtain arm angiograms.  The right groin was shaved, prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile manner.  The right common femoral artery was
     identified with fluoroscopic guidance based upon bony landmarks.  The area was
     infiltrated with 8 cc of 1% lidocaine.  A small skin [**Doctor Last Name 1197**] was made with an 11
     blade and a 19-gauge single wall puncture needle was inserted into the common
     femoral artery.  A .035 [**Last Name (un) 223**] guide wire was inserted into the abdominal
     aorta and the needle was exchanged for a 5-French sheath.  The side arm was
     attached to heparinized saline which infused throughout the case. Over the
     guide wire, a 5-French, 100-cm-in-length pigtail catheter was inserted and
     under fluoroscopic guidance was placed in the ascending aorta. An arch
     aortogram was performed including a view of the subclavian and carotid
     arteries bilaterally.  This arch aortogram was performed in a left anterior
     oblique projection.  The pigtail catheter was exchanged for a 5-French [**Location (un) 4608**]
     catheter which was inserted into the upper descending aorta.  The [**Last Name (un) 223**]
     guide wire was exchanged for a .035-inch angled Glidewire and under
     fluoroscopic guidance the catheter was advanced into the right subclavian
     artery.  Right arm arteriogram was performed.  Runoff films were performed
     with the catheter tip advanced into the right brachial artery.  The catheter
                                                                 (Over)

     was then pulled back into the proximal descending aorta and redirected under
     fluoroscopic guidance with the use of the angled Glidewire into the left
     subclavian artery.  A left upper extremity runoff angiogram was performed with
     distal films performed as the catheter tip was placed in the brachial artery.
     Poor runoff was noted, therefore, a blood-pressure cuff was placed over the
     upper arm and inflated to 120 mm Hg to occlude the upper arm arteriovenous
     fistula for better perfusion of the hand.  Runoff was performed including the
     hand.  The catheter was then removed.  The sheath was removed and adequate
     hemostasis was achieved with 15 minutes of manual pressure at the puncture
     site on the right common femoral artery.  The patient tolerated the procedure
     well.  No immediate complications were noted.
     
     FINDINGS: Incidentally noted bovine arch, which is normal in appearance. Great
     vessels are also normal.  There is an early takeoff of the right radial
     artery, at the level of the mid humerus.  The right arm runoff was significant
     for extensive below- elbow disease. The radial artery on the right is the
     dominant artery and form the palmar arch. Both interosseous and ulnar arteries
     are occluded proximally.  The ulnar artery reconstitutes but fills late. The
     deep arch fills via the radial artery.   The superficial arch does not
     opacify.
      The left upper extremity runoff included a patent radial artery with runoff
     into the hand. The ulnar artery is occluded at its origin. Patent interosseous
     artery is noted proximally but occludes thereafter.    The widely patent
     brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistula is noted. There is no significant flow
     change to the left hand following inflation of a blood pressure cuff, and
     therefore no evidence of steal syndrome is present.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No inflow disease to the bilateral upper extremities. Significant
     bilateral below-elbow vessel disease, left greater than right with bilateral
     radial arteries feeding the deep palmar arches.

     INDICATION: End stage renal disease. Chest pain now with upper GI bleeding.
     Complains of abdominal pain. R/O free air beneath the diaphragm.
     
     FINDINGS: Single AP upright view. Comparison study dated [**2961-2-13**]. There is
     again evidence of fairly large bilateral pleural effusions, not significantly
     changed from the prior study. However, the pulmonary vessels show a slightly
     lesser degree of upper zone redistribution. The cardiac silhouette is partly
     obscured by the effusions but shows fairly marked left ventricular
     enlargement. No independent pulmonary infiltrates are identified. Some
     compression atelectasis of the basal segments is noted in association with the
     effusions.
     
     IMPRESSION: Findings are consistent with left ventricular decompensation with
     fairly large bilateral pleural effusions. There appears to be slight
     improvement in the appearances of the pulmonary vessels suggesting recovering
     left heart failure.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Fifty-six year old woman with h/o coronary artery disease, PVD, ESRD,
     on dialysis, diabetes, cirrhosis, now with melena and decreasing hematocrit.
      
     DECISION:
      
     INTERPRETATION:  Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells 
     labeled with Tc-99m, blood flow and delayed images of the abdomen for 85 minutes
     were obtained.
      
     Blood flow images were unremarkable.
      
     Delayed blood pool images show expected activity in the heart, spleen and
     vessels.  There is no evidence of increasing tracer activity in bowel loops to
     suggest active bleed.
      
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of active GI bleed. /nkg

ID: PT temp came up to 98PO/R today. Bear hugger off. Sputum sent.
GI: Pt had 200cc coffee grounds in stomach at 10a. She was lavaged but did not clear completely. She has had only minimal amts of coffe grounds in stomach since then. By the afternoon she started to have increasingly larger amts of maroon stool. When seen by GI it was decided to scope her emergently. They are scoping now.
HEME: Crit at noon was 36 but was down to 31.8 at 4pm. She is ordered for 2 u PRBCs. Platelets 149. HIT sample sent.
CV: Pt was hemodynamically stable most of day off pressures. HR was in 60-70s NSR with rare PVCs and BP 130-160/90s. However during dialysis when attempts were made to remove fluid bp dropped transiently as low as 70 systolic. She received 300cc NS and BP stabilized. A-line seccessfully inserted in R radial.
RENAL: Dialysis started ~3pm but stopped early for scoping. She had no fluid removed.
RESP: Pt remains intubated. Her last gas was 7.48/ 31/ 211/ 24 on AC 14 X 500 5 peep and 50%. Vent settings were changed to AC 50 X 12 and 40% 5 PEEP and gas will be drawn post scoping. Her lungs are clear. Unable to obtain sat. Suctioned for scant yellow sputum.
SKIN: Dsgs changed on fingers. Minimal drainage. Skin on buttocks in tact. 
MS/SEDATION: Pt remains on sedation of Fentanyl 75 mic and versed 1mg, with occasional boluses given. She will open eyes, but did not seem to make eye contact or respond. She would turn her head when her name was called. Twice she opened her mouth when asked, but followed no other commands. She does not appear uncomfortable. Lidocaine and fentanyl patches held while she is on drip. 
A: Increasing maroon stool with crit drop

        56 year old woman with CAD, PVD, ESRD on HD, s/p NSTEMI now with GI bleed     
                
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      R subclavian placement

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CHEST:
     
     INDICATION:  Coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, endstage
     renal disease.  On hemodialysis.  Status post myocardial infarction with GI
     bleed.  Right subclavian line placed.
     
     FINDINGS:  A single AP supine view.  Comparison study dated [**2961-2-17**].  There is
     again evidence of a moderate sized right pleural effusion associated with some
     patchy infiltrate in the right lower zone and mid zone.  On the left side
     there is evidence of collapse and consolidation of the left lower lobe with
     little evidence of effusion.  The heart again shows fairly marked left
     ventricular enlargement.  The pulmonary vessels are difficult to evaluate with
     the patient supine but do suggest some left heart failure.  The endotracheal
     tube is in good position.  There appears to be a right subclavian line with
     its distal end extending upward into the right jugular venous system. Clinical
     correlation would be helpful.  This should be repositioned.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Findings are consistent with left heart failure with moderate
     sized right pleural effusion.  A right subclavian line appears to extend well
     up into the right jugular system.  It should be repositioned.  There is left
     lower lobe collapse and consolidation.

      56 year old woman with vasculopathy here for NSTEMI and GI bleed, intubated, 
      s/p prolonged code, now less responsive.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      irregularity found near sylvian fissure on MRI today, r/o acute bleed or other 
      acute process.
     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Cardiac arrest, now unresponsive.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT from [**2959-7-19**] and MR from today.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the brain were obtained without intravenous
     contrast.
     
     CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is no intra- or extraaxial hemorrhage.
     There is no shift of normal midline structures or mass effect.  The CSF spaces
     have increased since the examination in [**2959**] but are stable from earlier
     today.  There are no major vascular territorial infarcts.  There is a small
     focus of high attenuation in the middle cerebral artery in the region of
     abnormality seen on MRI from today.  This may reflect a small focus of calcium
     or be artifactual.
     
     The paranasal sinuses are clear.  Soft-tissue and osseous structures are
     unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.  ?Tiny focus of calcium
     in area of reported MRI abnormality.  However, this may be artifactual.  MRA
     is recommended for further evaluation.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Altered mental status after CODE.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2 weighted images and diffusion weighted
     images of the brain were performed.
     
     COMPARISONS: CT head exam [**2959-7-19**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
     The cerebral spinal fluid spaces are normal in size and symmetrical. The major
     vascular flow voids are preserved.
     
     A punctate focus of increased T2 signal within the deep white matter of the
     right cerebral hemisphere and increased signal adjacent to the right frontal
     temporal [**Doctor Last Name 234**] likely represent chronic small vessel disease. Calcifications
     are noted at the falx.  A suspicious area of hypointensity on T2 and
     susceptibility images within the left anterior sylvian fissure is identified,
     and is suspicious for blood and/or calcium.  Note is made of an air fluid
     level in the sphenoid sinuses.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Abnormal small focus of hypointensity on T2 and susceptibility images
     within the left anterior sylvian fissure suspicious for a focus of blood or
     calcium.  A CT of the head is recommended to rule out possible hemorrhage. If
     the CT of the head is negative, an MRA is recommended to rule out the
     possibility of a vascular abnormality, i.e., an aneurysm.
     2. Few nonspecific foci of increased T2 signal in the deep white matter
     consistent with chronic small vessel disease.

     segment elevation myocardial infarction.  Started on heparin and developed GI
     bleed.  Now found to be HIT antibody-positive.  Difficult access in neck.
     Assess for subclavian clot.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MR chest venogram.  Axial dark-blood HASTE; axial T1 turbo FLASH;
     axial 2D time-of-flight; coronal HASTE; multiple coronal VIBE sequences with
     and without gadolinium; subtraction images were performed.  Multiplanar
     reconstructed images were generated and evaluated on the workstation.  This
     patient was intubated.  For this study, the patient was paralyzed, and a
     respiratory technologist was present to suspend respirations when necessary.
     
     MR CHEST ANGIOGRAM WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST:
     
     There are large bilateral pleural effusions with severe compressive
     atelectasis of both lungs.  Note is made of subcutaneous edema in the chest
     wall.  There is an area of marked decreased perfusion relative to adjacent
     myocardium within the subendocardial inferior and posterior wall of the left
     ventricle on the delayed contrast- enhanced images, which is consistent with
     known myocardial infarction.
     
     The left cephalic vein is prominent and has early contrast enhancement, likely
     due to left arm AV fistula.  An approximately 2.4-cm segment of the cephalic
     vein has high-grade stenosis as it drains into left subclavian vein.  Only a
     short segment of cephalic vein is seen on the right side, and may be occluded.
     
     Both subclavian veins and internal jugular veins are patent.  The
     brachiocephalic veins and SVC are patent.
     
     There is no significant stenosis of the thoracic aorta or the great vessels.
     The left common carotid artery arises from the brachiocephalic trunk.
     
     There are small axillary lymph nodes bilaterally.
     
     Multiplanar reconstructions were essential in delineating the anatomy and
     pathology and confirm the above stated findings.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Large subendocardial inferior and posterior wall myocardial infarct in the

Events of shift: Ultrasound of abd. done, showed mod. amt. ascites; paracentesis planned, but cancelled for today. Pt. extubated @ 1600; required frequent NT suctioning post-extubation, placed on 100% NRB with O2 sats low-90's. Abg drawn; see carevue for results. Placed on BIPap @ ~ 1840 for worsening resp. status. Continue to monitor.

Review of systems

Neuro: Fentanyl gtt D/C'd @ 1030 today; no change in pt.'s responsiveness noted since this event. Still arousable to sound, tracks with eyes, does not attempt to communicate or follow commands. MAE.

Resp: Lungs coarse/rhonchorous T/O. Sxn'd multiple times for thick yellow sputum. Current RR mid-20's, O2 sats mid-90's on BiPap.

CV: HR SR with PVCs in the 70's, SBP 90-130's. 

GI: Pt. continues to have loose stools, now mucusy and brown with some frank blood (appears to be from hemmorhoids). Rectal bag applied as skin is now starting to break down. C-diff cx ordered, still needs to be sent. Pt. currently NPO, but prior to extubation was getting Criticare @ goal rate with minimal residuals.

GU: Anuric. Last HD yesterday.

Skin: Pt.'s inner thighs and labia starting to break down. Rectal bag applied to contain stool, Nystatin powder applied to thighs, barrier cream to rest. 

Social: Pt's daughter [**Name (NI) **] in to see her briefly today. Dtr. [**Doctor First Name **] called x 2 and was updated by this RN.

Am assessment: pt would open eyes, but not follow commands. PERLA but sluggish. Withdrawal from pain noted. Hr nsr in the 90-100's with occ pvc. Bp unable to read via Aline/dampened. Bp's instead were cycled Q [**5-28**] via non invasive. Pt's lungs at start of shift had coarse rhonchi t/o. resp sx'd for thick copious tan/brown secretions. team aware in rounds and cx of sputum just prior to arrest was being obtained. Respirations were high 20's to 30's and had been since on CPAP.  O2 sats dificult to obtain d/t poor peripheral vascular disease. AM ABG reflected 7.37/33/97.
   At approx. 1035 pt's Hr was found to be bradying down to 40-50's. Atropine obtained, cardiologist present. HR briefly went up to 50's then went into Complete heart block. Simultaneously Atropine 1mg was given IV while a cardiac arrest code was called. Pt went asystolic, was intubated by anesthesia and compressions were started. See code cart flow sheet for code sequence. After ~35 min of interventions pt was pronounced @ 11:19am by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 1691**]. Family in hospital at time of incident. Attending spoke with family, and grief counsel sat with family. Family refused autopsy.
