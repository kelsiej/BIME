Admission Date:  [**2592-10-3**]       Discharge Date:  [**2592-10-12**]

Date of Birth:   [**2508-5-14**]       Sex:  M

Service:  THORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 85-year-old male
with a history of coronary artery disease and mitral
regurgitation requiring a coronary artery bypass graft and
mitral valve replacement in [**2589**] who had a complicated
recovery since the surgery with pneumonia and a history of
intubation and tracheostomy.  The patient was complaining of
progressive dyspnea since his recovery from the cardiac
surgery and was evaluated with a CAT scan in [**2591-6-20**] and
was found to have high tracheal stenosis at the level of the
thoracic inlet with the lumen approximately 7 mm in diameter.
However, the patient was hesitant in seeking help and finally
consulted Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 1596**] of Interventional Pulmonology and
presents for a flexible bronchoscopy on the day of admission.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post CABG and MVR in
[**2589**].
2.  History of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.
3.  History of left atrial clot for which the patient has
been taking Coumadin.
4.  History of posterior circulation CVA.
5.  Obstructive [**Doctor Last Name 314**] apnea requiring CPAP.
6.  History of hip fracture, status post surgical repair.
7.  History of fall with recent subdural hemorrhage which is
stable.
8.  History of seizure disorder.
9.  Benign prostatic hyperplasia.
10. Hyperthyroidism.
11. Irritable bowel syndrome.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Celexa 40 mg q.d.
2.  Provigil 200 mg q.a.m.
3.  Cozaar 25 mg q.d.
4.  Coumadin, alternating doses of 5 mg and 7.5 mg.
5.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.

8.  Flomax 0.4 mg q.h.s.
9.  Guaifenesin 600 mg b.i.d.
10. Celebrex 200 mg q.d.
11. Albuterol/Atrovent nebulizer treatments.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to phenothiazine,
Demerol, and iodine-based IV contrast.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Significant for tobacco smoking.  He quit at
the age of 30.  Social alcohol consumption.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On admission, white count 5.4,
hematocrit 37.8, platelets 166,000.  PT/PTT 15.8/29.3, INR
1.7.  Chemistries revealed a sodium of 141, potassium 4.3,
chloride 105, C02 26, BUN 24, creatinine 0.9 with a glucose
of 115, calcium 9.3, magnesium 1.9, phosphate 3.3.

Pulmonary function testing done on [**2592-7-13**] with
moderate to restrictive impairment with decreased FVC and
FEV1 and normal FEV1/FVC.

Transthoracic echocardiogram done on [**2592-9-14**]
showed left atrium mildly dilated with an abnormal shadowing
echodensity in the posterior portion consistent with a clot,
moderate to severely reduced global left ventricular systolic
function with an ejection fraction of 20-25% consistent with
his history of MI, coronary artery disease, status post CABG.

Chest CT done on [**2592-9-12**] showed a small subdural hemorrhage
along the right tentorium, cerebellum, without mass affect,
small right frontal and parietal infarcted areas were noted.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  The patient
was afebrile with a temperature of 96.7, heart rate 78, blood
pressure 120/64, respiratory rate 20, saturating at 96% on
room air.  General:  The patient was alert and oriented times
three, in no apparent distress.  The patient stridorous but
speaking.  HEENT:  Pupils were equally round and reactive to
light and accommodation with extraocular movements intact.
The oropharynx was clear without any lesions.  Neck:  Supple,
nontender, no bruits noted.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally with transmitted upper airway noise.
Cardiovascular:  Irregularly/irregular heart rate, no audible
murmurs.  Abdomen:  Bowel sounds soft, nontender,
nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly appreciated.
Extremities:  No edema with good palpable dorsalis pedis
pulses.  Neurologic:  Cranial nerves II through XII grossly
intact with intact motor and sensory systems in the
extremities grossly.  The rectal examination was Guaiac
negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent a flexible
bronchoscopy with Interventional Pulmonology and was found to
have severe obstruction at the proximal trachea and was
admitted for further observation and management.  Because of
his subtherapeutic anticoagulation, the patient was started
on a heparin drip with a goal to titrate up to PTT of 60-80.

Neurology consult was obtained.  A review of the head CT was
done.  There were no absolute contraindications to
anticoagulation from their point of view.  Cardiology consult
was also called for preoperative evaluation and it was felt
that there was no evidence of ongoing ischemia or severe
decompensation of heart failure at this time.  The patient
still has moderate to high risk of perioperative cardiac
event.  The patient was started on a beta blocker
preoperatively.

Because of the severe tracheal stenosis and danger of airway
obstruction, the patient was admitted to the MICU for
observation prior to surgery.  The patient was evaluated by
the Thoracic Surgery Service and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 682**] as consulted by
Interventional Pulmonology and for possible surgical
intervention.  At the time, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 12383**] and his family said
that they did not want a tracheostomy nor did they want a T
tube and stated that he would prefer to die than to have
those procedures.  Therefore, the patient was recommended a
tracheal resection and reconstruction or a bronchoscopic
procedure.

After the risks of the surgery was fully explained and all
questions were answered and informed consent was obtained,
the patient was taken to the OR on [**2592-10-8**] for a
possible tracheal resection and reconstruction.  However,
this procedure was aborted due to the inability to establish
with any degree of certainty that the anastomosis would be
due without any undue tension.  The patient went ahead with
the alternative plan for a bronchoscopic approach and
underwent a rigid bronchoscopy with dilatation and stent of
the proximal tracheal stenosis on [**2592-10-8**] by
Interventional Pulmonology.

Postoperatively, the patient did relatively well.  On
postoperative day number one, the patient was complaining of
difficulty swallowing.  Given his prior history of CVA and
dysphagia, Speech and Swallow consult was called.  The
initial evaluation was that the patient did not demonstrate
any overt signs or symptoms of aspiration.  The patient went
ahead with a video swallow study.  On video swallow study,
the patient demonstrated aspiration with nectar-thick liquids
and thin liquids and the patient was initially placed on
n.p.o. status.

However, after an extensive discussion with the
Interventional Pulmonology Team and with the patient, it was
clear that this was not an acute process given his history of
CVA and his history of dysphagia and given the fact that the
patient was only a few days out from surgery that these
findings may be transiently related to postoperative
recovery.

With the patient's insistence on starting on a pureed diet
which he had been taking prior to admission and with full
understanding of risks of aspiration and pneumonia as
explained by the staff to the patient, the patient was
cautiously started on a pureed diet.  The patient tolerated a
pureed diet without signs or symptoms of aspiration.  The
patient was also started on Coumadin per his schedule and
continued on IV heparin and because his INR was not
therapeutic the patient was converted over to Lovenox
anticoagulation therapy at 70 mg subcutaneously q. 12 hours
for full anticoagulant effect while he continued his
anticoagulation with p.o. Coumadin at rehabilitation.  At
discharge, the patient's INR was 1.9.

     Re-review of the study is performed including thin section reconstructed
     1.2 mm axial images. The apparent area of focal stenosis at the
     cervicothoracic junction region on the multiplanar images is confirmed on the
     thin section axial images. This has a somewhat web-like configuration on the
     multiplanar images. These findings correspond to the site of the known
     stenosis documented by recent bronchoscopy.

      84 year old man with airway obstruction
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      airway obstruction
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:  Evaluate for possible airway obstruction. 
     
     CT TRACHEA:  Helical CT of the central airways was performed without IV or
     oral contrast administration, according to the CT trachea protocol. Protocol
     does not include imaging of the entire chest and only extends to approximately
     2-3 cm below the carina.  No IV or oral contrast was administered.
     Images were initially acquired using a standard dose at end inspiration.
     Subsequently, using a low dose technique, images were acquired during dynamic
     expiration. The patient had difficulty following instructions for this phase
     of the study.  The axial data will be used to create multiplanar and 3D
     images which will be reviewed when available.
     
     No prior studies are available for comparison.
     
     Evaluation of the larynx and subglottic regions are limited due to marked
     kyphotic positioning of the patient, with regard to the intrathoracic trachea,
     it is normal in caliber.  The mainstem bronchi are also patent and the
     visualized lobar bronchi are also patent without evidence of endobronchial or
     obstructing lesions. Note is made of some thickening of the posterior wall of
     the right upper lobe bronchus.
     
     As mentioned, the patient had difficulty cooperating with dynamic expiratory
     phase of respiration, with this limitation in mind, no malacia is identified.
     
     Soft tissue structures demonstrate axillary and mediastinal lymph nodes which
     do not meet strict criteria for enlargment with the exception of a slightly
     enlarged precarinal node which has a fatty center.  There is a large rounded
     soft tissue density in the subcarinal region located in the expected region of
     the left atrium.  This presumably represents a markedly enlarged left atrium,
     but is difficult to fully assess without IV contrast and due to incomplete
     imaging of this region.  The lateral scout image reveals that the patient has
     had a prior mitral valve replacement.  Note is made of distention of the
     thoracic esophagus proximal to this level, likely due to extrinsic
     compression.
     
     The imaged portion of the lungs demonstrate minimal areas of linear
     opacification in the superior segments of the lower lobes most likely due to
     discoid atelectasis or focal scarring.  There is slight thickening of the
     right major fissure.
     
     The imaged skeletal structures demonstrate marked kyphosis and degenerative
     changes in the spine. Note is also made of prior coronary artery bypass
     surgery.
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     
     Multiplanar and 3-d images confirm the above findings. Apparent stenosis in
     cervicothoracic junction region is likely due to artifact from severe
     kyphotic positioning, but correlation with bronchoscopy results is
     recommended to exclude a true abnormality in this region.
     
     IMPRESSION:   Limited examination demonstrating no evidence of obstruction of
     the intrathoracic trachea, mainstem bronchi or lobar bronchi.  Please note
     evaluation of the larynx and cervicothoracic junction region are limited due
     to severe kyphotic positioning.
     
     Thickening of the posterior wall of the right upper lobe bronchus of uncertain
     etiology. This could represent mucosal or submucosal disease.  Correlation
     with bronchoscopy results is suggested.
     
     No evidence of malacia, but the patient had difficulty cooperating with
     expiratory imaging.  If there is clinical suspicion for malacia, the patient
     could return for additional expiratory phase of imaging at no additional
     charge.
     
     Large rounded soft tissue density in the subcarinal region, possibly
     representing an enlarged left atrium in this patient with evidence of prior
     mitral valve replacement.  However, this area is difficult to assess due to
     absence of IV Contrast and lack of complete imaging. Correlative
     echocardiogram or contrast-enhanced CT would be helpful to confirm left atrial
     enlargement and to exclude an extra cardiac abnormality in this region.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     INDICATION: 84 year old man with history of subdural hemorrhage for which he
     was followed at an outside hospital.  He was recently restarted on his
     anticoagulation and has not had any interval head trauma.  Assess for residual
     subdural hematoma.  The reports from the outside CT scans are not available,
     thus it is not known where the subdural hematoma was for which they were
     following him.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast head CT.  Please note there is a small amount of motion
     limiting the exam.  The patient was markedly stridorous due to known tracheal
     narrowing.  These are the best images possible due to his stridor, attempts to
     repeat the exam were not made.
     
     FINDINGS:  There are no extraaxial hemorrhagic collections.  There is no
     evidence of intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  No areas particularly concerning for
     subdural hemorrhage are noted.  There is sublte high density along the falx
     cerebri as it courses between the occipital lobes.  At this time this is not
     worrisome for a subdural hematoma.  It would be helpful to know exactly where
     the prior subdural was located.  There is low attenuation within the right
     parietal lobe and along the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 234**] of the right lateral ventricle
     compatible with prior ischemic changes.  The remaining [**Doctor Last Name 30**]-white matter
     differentiation is preserved.  Within the right cerebellar hemisphere is a 3.0
     x 3.0 cm low density lesion which may arise from the cerebellum tentorium or
     the CSF in this region.  This measures 10 [**Doctor Last Name **] and does not have surrounding
     edema.  This is of uncertain etiology but may represent an arachnoid cyst vs
     epidermoid. By report, this was present on prior studies and is not increasing
     in size.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate no destructive osseous lesions.
     
     The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are normally pneumatized.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Exam limited by motion but no definite hemorrhage is seen.  There is high
     density along the falx cerebri between the occipital lobes.  While this may
     represent a small amount of subdural hematoma this also could just merely be
     normal tentorium.
     
     2) Low density lesion within the area of the cerebellum without evidence of
     surrounding edema.  The differential diagnosis includes and arachnoid cyst,
     epidermoid and other lesions.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION:  Tracheal stenosis for OR on [**10-8**].
     
     FINDINGS:  CABG changes are evident and prosthetic mitral valve is seen.
     There is no focal consolidation.  The left hemidiaphragm is elevated.  There
     is multi-chamber cardiomegaly, however, the pulmonary vasculature appears
     normal.  Some blunting of the right posterior costophrenic sulcus could be
     scarring or a small effusion.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified.  Diffuse
     degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are seen and some loss of height
     anteriorly and some upper thoracic vertebral levels suggest prior osteoporotic
     impression.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Cardiomegaly and CABG changes.

     Portable chest of [**2592-10-8**] compared to previous study of 1 day earlier.
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Stent placement.
     
     There has been interval placement of a tracheal stent above the level of the
     thoracic inlet.  A Swan-Ganz catheter is in satisfactory position within the
     right pulmonary artery.  The heart is enlarged and there is no evidence of
     congestive heart failure.  There is minor atelectasis at the left lung base
     and a small left pleural effusion is also noted.  The right lung appears
     clear.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Tracheal stent is present above the level of the thoracic
     inlet. Due to kyphosis, this is difficult to fully assess.
     
     2)  Swan-Ganz catheter in satisfactory position with no evidence of
     pneumothorax.

     INDICATION:  Dysphagia.
     
     FINDINGS:  The study was performed in conjunction with the speech/swallow
     therapist.  Various consistencies of barium were administered orally.  The
     oral phase was not fully assessed, but appeared to be within functional
     limits. With nectar consistency, there was severe residue in the valleculae,
     which ultimately resulted in laryngeal penetration and aspiration.  There was
     decreased elevation of the larynx and markedly decreased epiglottic deflection
     which allowed for penetration of the laryngeal vestibule.  With thin
     consistencies, there was laryngeal penetration and aspiration during swallow.
     The patient had an intermittent reflexive cough which was effective in
     partially clearing the larynx.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Aspiration with thin and nectar consistencies, which is likely
     secondary to poor epiglottic deflection and decreased laryngeal elevation.
     Please refer to the report of the speech/swallow therapist for further
     details.

     Comparison is made to [**10-7**] and [**2592-10-8**].  The heart is enlarged with a
     tortuous aorta, unchanged from the prior study.  Again noted post CABG
     changes, as well as the prosthetic MVR.  The left hemi-diaphragm is slightly
     elevated, also unchanged.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
     There is slight opacification of the right lung base, but allowing for
     technique, this is unchanged from the prior study of [**2592-10-7**].  There are no
     new focal consolidations.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly without evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     CT TRACHEA:  [**2593-7-22**], compared to previous study of [**2592-10-3**].
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Status-post stent placement for tracheal stenosis.
     
     Helical CT of the central airways was performed without intravenous or oral
     contrast adminstration.  Images were acquired with instructions for
     inspiratory and dynamic expiratory phases of respiration.  Per the CT trachea
     protocol, imaging extended several cm below the carina but did not include the
     entirety of the thorax.  Axial CT data will be used to create a series of
     multiplanar and 3D images and an addendum will be issued to the report when
     they become available.
     
     Since the prior CT, the patient has undergone placement of a metallic stent
     which traverses the previously present stenosis.  The stent extends from the
     lower cervical trachea into the proximal thoracic trachea.  As noted
     previously, there is an unusual curvature of the airway in the cervicothoracic
     junction region related to the patient's severe kyphoscoliosis.  The inferior
     aspect of the stent has a slightly frayed appearance and is difficult to
     exclude focal disruption of the distal most aspect.  Note is made of soft
     tissue thickening along the internal luminal surface of the stent with some
     polypoid projections.  This may represent granulation tissue.  Routine
     secretions could also produce a similar appearance.  Below the level of the
     stent, routine secretions are seen dependently within the trachea.  Note is
     also made of a small polypoid dependent opacity in the distal right upper lobe
     bronchus.  In retrospect, a similar opacity is seen on the earlier study. This
     is just proximal to the trifurcation of the right upper lobe bronchus. The
     remaining central airways are unremarkable.
     
     The imaged portions of the lungs demonstrate mild bronchial wall thickening
     and scattered areas of septal thickening likely due to a component of
     congestive heart failure.  Note is also made of dependent linear opacities
     which are unchanged in the interval and likely related to areas of focal
     scarring within both lower lobes.
     
     Images obtained during dynamic expiratory phase of respiration demonstrate
     diffuse tracheobronchial malacia involving the entirety of the trachea below
     the stent and extending into the main stem bronchi which is most severe in the
     left main bronchus, demonstrating near complete collapse.  Within the proximal
     trachea, the degree of collapse is considered marked with reduction in cross
     sectional diameter from 441 mm squared to 138 mm squared.  Diffuse multifocal
     air trapping is seen throughout the lungs on expiratory imaging.
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     
     Soft tissue structures of the thorax demonstrate mildly enlarged mediastinal
     lymph node is the precarinal region which is essentially stable compared to
     the previous study.  There is marked enlargement of the imaged portion of the
     left atrium.  Coronary artery calcifications are noted.  There is distention
     of the thoracic esophagus above the level of the left atrium, possibly due to
     compression by the enlarged atrium.
     
     Additional thin section images are reviewed and allow more complete assessment
     of the stent.  On these images, the proximal most portion of the stent extends
     into the subglottic region.  These images confirm the unusual configuration of
     the distal most portion of the stent concerning for focal disruption.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Status-post placement of stent at site of proximal stenosis.  The proximal
     most portion of the stent extends into the subglottic region, and the distal
     portion terminates at the thoracic inlet level.  There is unusual appearance
     of the distal most portion of the stent raising the concern for focal
     disruption, and correlation with direct visualization is recommended.
     Additionally, granulation tissue is noted along the internal lumen of the
     stent.
     2.  Small dependent polypoid opacity in distal right upper lobe bronchus
     although possibly due to routine secretions, the presence of a similar finding
     in this region in retrospect on the earlier study also raises a concern for
     the possibility of a discrete endobronchial lesion in this area.  Correlation
     with direct visualization findings may be helpful in this regard.
     3.  Diffuse tracheobronchomalacia.
     4.  Mild congestive heart failure.
     5.  When available, the multiplanar and 3D images will be reviewed.  An
     addendum will be issued to the report at this time.
     
     
     ADDENDUM: Multiplanar and 3d images confirm the above findings.
