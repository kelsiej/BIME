     CHEST 2 VIEWS PA & LATERAL:
     
     HISTORY: Arrhythmia.
     
     No previous films for comparison. Heart size is within normal limits with mild
     prominence of the LV contour but no evidence for CHF. There is slight
     unfolding of the thoracic aorta. Possible small calcific focus is present at
     the right lung base. An apparent collection of tiny nodular densities in the
     right mid zone seen only in the PA film is likely due to end on vessels. The
     remainder of the lungs are clear and there are no pleural effusions. There is
     calcification in the anterior longitudinal ligament of the thoracic spine.
     
     IMPRESSION: No evidence for CHF. Tiny nodular densities on right likely due to
     vascular structures but this may be confirmed by a short term follow up exam.
     No evidence for pneumonia or pleural effusion.

Admission Date: [**2727-3-1**]
Discharge Date: [**2727-3-8**]
Date of Birth:  [**2650-10-14**]
Sex:  M
Service:  CSU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 12248**] is a 76-year-old
gentleman with a past medical history of kidney stones,
hyperlipidemia, GERD, gout, and urethral stenting who had
noticed sometime shortly after [**Holiday 1726**] time to have
increased swelling of his ankles (as noted by his primary
care physician).

His primary care physician actually paid him a home visit and
noted his heart rate to be 140 with a blood pressure of
200/100, and the patient was to the Emergency Room and placed
on sotalol, Lasix, and Vasotec, and warfarin with a good
result.  The patient was then seen at the [**Hospital3 **]
Hospital where he underwent a cardiac catheterization which
revealed 3-vessel disease.  He was seen by the Cardiac
Surgery Service and worked up for surgery in the usual
preoperative manner.  He was discharged to home with an
elective surgery date of [**3-1**].

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was electively admitted to the
[**Hospital3 **] Hospital on [**3-1**] when he was taken on to
the Operating Room and underwent a CABG times four as well as
replacement of his aortic valve with a 23 [**Last Name (un) 163**]-[**Doctor Last Name 164**]
Magna valve.  The patient also underwent a LIMA to the LAD, a
saphenous vein graft to the diagonal artery, a saphenous vein
graft to the posterior descending artery, as well as
posterior left branch.

The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported
hemodynamically stable on Neo-Synephrine and propofol to the
Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit for further recovery.
The patient was slowly weaned off of sedation and awoke from
surgery neurologically intact.  He was extubated roughly six
or seven hours after the operation.  The patient continued to
require blood pressure support with Neo-Synephrine.  Given
the fact that his heart rate was bradycardic around the 40s
and 50s, the patient continued to be atrial paced at 80.

The patient was weaned off all anatropic support by
postoperative day two.  He was then transferred to the
Cardiac Telemetry Unit for further recovery. He was noted on
the night on postoperative day two to enter into atrial
fibrillation and was treated for this with an amiodarone
bolus as well as starting on oral amiodarone.

On postoperative day three, the patient's wires were
discontinued without incident as well as chest tubes.  He
began to work with cardiac rehabilitation for his mobility
issues.  He returned to a normal sinus rhythm.  Given his
history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, he was started on
anticoagulation.  On postoperative day four, his beta
blockade was increased.  He returned to all of his
preoperative medications.  By postoperative day six, it was
felt that his anticoagulation was in line.  The patient was
deemed ready for discharge to home.  Of note, the patient was
noted to have some slight drainage around the sternal wound
with some erythema associated with this and was started on
Keflex 500 mg p.o. four times daily for a duration of five
days.  He will return to the office for followup in five
weeks.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient will be discharged to
home.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  The patient will follow up with his
primary care physician in four to five week, as well as his
cardiologist in four to five weeks, as well as Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in four to five weeks.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  At the time of discharge, the patient was
clinically in a normal sinus rhythm in the 60s.  He was
afebrile.  Blood pressure was 134/52.  Laboratory analysis at
the time of discharge showed a hematocrit of 25.6,  BUN and
creatinine of 26 and 1.2, potassium level of 4.4, INR level
of 1.5.  A chest x-ray at the time of discharge showed no
pneumothorax and a small left pleural effusion.  The EKG
showed him to be in a normal sinus rhythm.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Amiodarone 400 mg twice daily.
2. Baby aspirin 81 mg p.o.
3. Keflex 500 mg p.o. four times daily (for duration of five
   days).
4. Plavix 75 mg p.o. once daily.
5. Lasix 40 mg p.o. twice daily.
6. Lopressor 25 mg p.o. twice daily
7. Coumadin 5 mg p.o. once daily.


DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient will be sent home with a
visiting nurse who will draw an anticoagulation status and
have the results faxed over to primary care physician.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Coronary artery disease.

     INDICATION:  76-year-old man status post aortic valve replacement and coronary
     artery bypass graft x 4.  Postoperative film.
     
     Comparison is made with the prior PA & lateral views of the chest dated
     [**2727-2-21**].
     
     SINGLE AP VIEW CHEST:  Sternal wires and sutures indicate prior surgery.  A
     right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter is seen with the tip in the proximal
     pulmonary outflow tract.  The nasogastric tube is seen with the tip below the
     diaphragm, in the area of the fundus of the stomach.  An endotracheal tube is
     seen approximately 3 cm superior to the carina.  Left-sided chest tube is seen
     with the tip in the left lung apex.
     
     The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar silhouettes are all widened, most likely
     related to the postop state.  The pulmonary vasculature is slightly prominent
     bilaterally.  Bilateral lungs are clear without evidence of infiltrates,
     effusions, or consolidations.  Surrounding soft tissue and osseous structures
     reveal degenerative joint disease along the thoracic spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Endotracheal tube approximately 3 cm superior to the carina.  Remaining
     lines and tubes as above.
     
     2) Left chest tube with tip in left lung apex.  No evidence of pneumothorax.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     Two views of chest dated [**2727-3-7**], compared to [**2727-3-1**].
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Status post CABG.
     
     There has been interval removal of various lines and tubes.  No pneumothorax
     is evident.  There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  The aorta is
     mildly tortuous.  There is a subtle bilateral reticular pattern in the lung
     periphery, which in retrospect was also present on the preoperative
     radiograph.  Small well-defined nodular opacities in the right lung adjacent
     to the minor fissure and adjacent to the right hemidiaphragm are stable
     compared to the preoperative radiograph.
     
     Note is made of median sternotomy, coronary bypass surgery, and aortic valve
     replacement.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Small bilateral pleural effusions and minor basilar atelectasis.
     
     2)  No evidence of pneumothorax following chest tube removal.
     
     3)  Subtle peripheral interstitial pattern without change from the
     preoperative radiograph.  Does the patient have a history of respiratory
     symptoms to suggest chronic interstitial lung disease?
