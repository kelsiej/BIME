[**3375-6-26**] C-spine CT
IMPRESSION: Extensive degenerative changes of the cervical spine 
with no evidence of acute fracture or malalignment

[**3375-7-2**] right hip x-ray
IMPRESSION: No evidence of right-sided hip fracture. Should 
strong clinical suspicion for right hip injury persist, 
performance of either nuclide examination or MRI is recommended 
to exclude nondisplaced fracture in this area

 
Brief Hospital Course:
[**Date range (1) 12090**] After intubation in the ED the patient was taken for 
further imaging studies. He had CT of the head/c-spine/torso 
which revealed no new acute injury or finding. The patient's 
large right posterior scalp laceration was repaired in ED. The 
patient was then transferred to the ICU for close monitoring. He 
remained in the TSICU for several days. During this time he was 
transfused 1 U of PRBC. He had an episode of flash pulmonary 
edema thought to be [**3-15**] fluid overload and was successfully 
diuresed with lasix. His vent was weaned and the patient was 
extubated on HD 2. Based on history and physical exam it was 
thought the patient's fall was [**3-15**] syncope. Cardiology was 
consulted and an ECHO was obtained and the patient was found to 
have moderated to severe Aortic Stenosis. The patient also had 
an increase in his cardiac enzymes [**3-15**] several episodes of 
hypotension and anemia related to his bleeding (demand 
ischemia). Troponins were negative

[**Date range (1) 12091**] The patient was transferred to the floor where he 
continued to improve. He was evaluated by physical therapy who 
felt he would benefit from acute rehab. He will followup with 
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] after discharge; patient has declined surgical 
intervention for his aortic stenosis at this time. Instead he 
was started on a beta-blocker and this was continued at 
discharge.

     INDICATION:  89-year-old man fell down stairs, rule out pneumothorax or
     fracture.
     
     TRAUMA TWO SERIES (AP CHEST AND AP PELVIS):  No priors for comparison.
     Endotracheal tube is identified, approximately 6 cm above the carina.  There
     is no evidence to suggest pneumothorax on this single AP supine film.  Please
     see the dedicated chest CT for a more sensitive evaluation.  Heart size within
     normal limits.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Overlying the left
     hilum, there is an abnormal contour of unclear etiology.  This may represent
     overlap shadow from the aortic arch and a prominent pulmonary vessel; however,
     attention to this should be paid on the chest CT.  Heart size within normal
     limits.  The lungs are otherwise clear without evidence of contusion.  No
     evidence of fracture is seen within the thorax.  Left bipolar femoral
     prosthesis, without evidence of hardware loosening.  Rightfemoral deformity,
     underlying supcapital fracture difficult to exclude. Severe degenerative
     changes of the lower lumbosacral spine without evidence of obvious fracture.
     No other fracture is identified within the pelvis.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Right femoral varus deformity; underlying subcapital fracture not excluded,
     see CT Torso to follow
     2) Endotracheal tube in satisfactory position.  No pneumothorax identified on
     this supine film.
     3) Abnormal left hilar contour. This likely represents overlap from the aortic
     arch and the pulmonary vasculature; however, given the trauma setting,
     attention to this area on chest CT is also recommended.

     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were
     obtained after the administration of IV contrast.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is extensive atherosclerotic disease
     of the aorta.  There is no evidence of dissection.  There is a 14 mm
     precarinal lymph node and multiple smaller pretracheal lymph nodes.  There are
     no pathologically enlarged hilar or axillary lymph nodes.  The heart and
     pericardium are grossly unremarkable.  Note is made of coronary artery
     calcifications and possible aortic valve calcifications.  Likely emphysematous
     related changes with small cystic areas demonstrated within the lung
     parenchyma, most pronounced in the right upper lobe.  There is bilateral
     dependent atelectasis.  There is basilar atelectasis versus scarring.  Note is
     made of compressive atelectasis of the right lower lobe secondary to large
     vertebral body osteophytes.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  An NG tube is demonstrated terminating in
     the duodenum.  The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and
     kidneys are grossly unremarkable.  The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast
     symmetrically.  There is no intraperitoneal free air or free fluid.  There is
     slight stranding of the mesenteric fat diffusely, a nonspecific sign.  There
     is slight stranding of the subcutaneous tissues, suggestive of possible edema.
     There are no pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes
     by CT criteria.  There is no free air or free fluid.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a Foley catheter in a
     decompressed bladder.  There is air in the bladder consistent with recent
     catheterization.  The pelvic structures are obscured secondary to artifact
     from the patient's metallic left hip prosthesis.  No gross abnormalities
     detected of the rectum or sigmoid colon.  No evidence of pelvic free fluid.
     There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy identified.  Extensive
     atherosclerotic disease of the intrapelvic arterial structures is
     demonstrated.

     Bone windows demonstrate a left total hip replacement with a scoliotic
     curvature of the spine and extensive degenerative disease of the spine.  The
     alignment is grossly normal.  There are right seventh and eighth rib
     fractures that appear to be chronic. There is a mixed lytic and sclerotic
     focus in the left iliac bone of unknown significance.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Extensive atherosclerotic disease.
     2)  Emphysematous changes of the lungs.
     3)  Precarinal and pretracheal lymphadenopathy, nonspecific finding.
     4)  Extensive degenerative disease of the spine.
     5)  Right seventh and eighth rib fractures, that appear chronic and partially
     healed.

     INDICATION:  Status post fall.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were
     obtained after the administration of IV contrast.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is extensive atherosclerotic disease
     of the aorta.  There is no evidence of dissection.  There is a 14 mm
     precarinal lymph node and multiple smaller pretracheal lymph nodes.  There are
     no pathologically enlarged hilar or axillary lymph nodes.  The heart and
     pericardium are grossly unremarkable.  Note is made of coronary artery
     calcifications and possible aortic valve calcifications.  Likely emphysematous
     related changes with small cystic areas demonstrated within the lung
     parenchyma, most pronounced in the right upper lobe.  There is bilateral
     dependent atelectasis.  There is basilar atelectasis versus scarring.  Note is
     made of compressive atelectasis of the right lower lobe secondary to large
     vertebral body osteophytes.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  An NG tube is demonstrated terminating in
     the duodenum.  The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and
     kidneys are grossly unremarkable.  The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast
     symmetrically.  There is no intraperitoneal free air or free fluid.  There is
     slight stranding of the mesenteric fat diffusely, a nonspecific sign.  There
     is slight stranding of the subcutaneous tissues, suggestive of possible edema.
     There are no pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes
     by CT criteria.  There is no free air or free fluid.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a Foley catheter in a
     decompressed bladder.  There is air in the bladder consistent with recent
     catheterization.  The pelvic structures are obscured secondary to artifact
     from the patient's metallic left hip prosthesis.  No gross abnormalities
     detected of the rectum or sigmoid colon.  No evidence of pelvic free fluid.
     There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy identified.  Extensive
     atherosclerotic disease of the intrapelvic arterial structures is
     demonstrated.
                                                                 (Over)

      89 year old man with right hip pain ?of subcapital fracture on prior imaging 
      studies 
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      r/out fracture                                                                  
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Right hip pain, questionable subcapital fracture on prior imaging
     studies, evaluate for fracture.
     
     FINDINGS:  The question of a possible hip injury is initiated on a previous
     portable pelvis trauma examination of [**3375-6-25**].  The right hip was
     demonstrated in markedly neck foreshortened projection with the leg rotated
     externally.  Overlying structures of the trauma board precluded any detailed
     analysis of the area.  The present examination includes an AP view of the
     pelvis demonstrating the presence of a left-sided total hip joint replacement
     and the right-sided hip in moderate external rotation.  The right-sided hip
     joint, joint distance is preserved and moderate degree of degenerative
     manifestations is present in the form of increased sclerosis of the acetabular
     contours and osteophytic prominences at the edges.  No evidence of fracture is
     present and the periarticular soft tissue structures are quite normal.  An AP
     cone-down view of the right hip frontal projection again demonstrates the hip
     joint in moderate lateral external rotation not quite freeing the lateral
     cervical wall which is partially superimposed by the trochanter.  There is,
     however, no suspicion for any acute fracture.  Frog view also demonstrates
     normal alignment of the femoral head within the acetabulum and no evidence of
     hip fracture can be identified.  Surprisingly, the patient demonstrates
     moderate amount of arterial wall calcifications in the femoral artery and its
     tributaries.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of right-sided hip fracture.  Should strong clinical
     suspicion for right hip injury persist, performance of either nuclide
     examination or MRI is recommended to exclude nondisplaced fracture in this
     area.
